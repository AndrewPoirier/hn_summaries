&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on providing insights and resources related to the concept of "reflective practice" in various contexts, emphasizing its importance for personal and professional development. It likely offers tools, examples, and methodologies to help individuals effectively engage in reflective practices to enhance their learning and growth. The goal is to promote self-awareness and continuous improvement through reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to try this, work through the artithmetic, it’s incredibly easy (and a fun Saturday morning exercise if you’re into this kind of thing) to code up on ShaderToy. From scratch is fun, but if you need a hint to get started I just made one https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mc3cW2 and there are a bunch of super clever text hacks other people have done like this Matrix in less than 300 characters https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llXSzj or green CRT display effect https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtfSD8. Loads of other examples abound if you look around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is delightfully clever and hacky (so basically like every 3d rendering technique ever) but the end result isn't exactly beautiful unless you're trying to recreate an old school electronic billboard. You could improve it by adding more bits, but long before it starts to look good you'd be searching for an easier way to handle setting all the bits... And there's almost certainly no more efficient solution than using black and white pixels in a drawing program then saving the results in a texture. So, full circle.If anyone is interested in the a more common way that modern 3d rendering engines draw text, look up SDF text (and related techniques like MSDF etc.). This uses a traditional texture atlas in a preprossing step to create an atlas of signed distance fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also the option of rendering text as meshes.TextMeshPro goes one step further and uses signed distance fields to handle arbitrary scale.https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093037</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Delta is a syntax-highlighting pager for git and diff output that enhances the readability of diffs in the terminal. It formats git diff output with color-coded differences, making it easier for users to review changes in code visually. Delta is designed to be customizable, allowing users to adjust colors, styles, and behavior to suit their needs. It also supports various features, such as paging, the ability to show word differences, and integration with tools like GitHub and GitLab. The project is open-source and actively maintained on GitHub, where users can find installation instructions and contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delta has been one of those set and forget things, it's been a while since I've seen 'bare' git grep/diff/blame output, I also use it all the time for normal diffs (outside of git repos), but TIL that it also works with ripgrep [0]As someone else already mentioned there is also bat[1], which was also set and forget, I aliased cat to bat and have a seperate alias vcat for 'vanilla cat' /usr/bin/cat[0] https://dandavison.github.io/delta/grep.html[1] https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a good point made, that has stuck with me over the years. that our syntax highlighters are highlighting the wrong thing.They should not be coloring the grammar, we are good at picking out grammar, they should be highlighting the symbols. each different variable and function name should be getting it's own color. that is, the goal is to make it quicker to distinguish different symbols, not that they are a symbol.But this is much harder than stylizing the grammar so all our tooling sticks with the easy thing rather that the useful thing. Now, I am being a bit mean on grammar styling. It does help quite a bit but I would like to see a symbol matching engine in action to see if that really works.Unfortunately I don't remember where I read the original post and am unable to attribute it correctly.update: while trying to look it up I found this https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2014/09/27/the-definitive-gui...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of diffs, one thing that annoys me about Git's diff output is that is prints file paths like Unix diff traditionally does, starting with the two file names:    --- a/some/path/to/file.c
    +++ b/some/path/to/file.c

I often cmd-click in iTerm to open a file in an editor, but this doesn't work here because of the a/ and b/ prefixes. Any way to make Git format the file name better? I don't even need two lines here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091365</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the architecture, they will probably run into some issues. We are doing something similar with SemanticDiff [1] and also started out using tree-sitter grammars for parsing and GumTree for matching. Both choices turned out to be problematic.Tree sitter grammars are primarily written to support syntax highlighting and often use a best effort approach to parsing. This is perfectly fine for syntax highlighting, since the worst that can happen is that a few characters are highlighted incorrectly. However, when diffing or modifying code you really want the code to be parsed according to the upstream grammar, not something that mostly resembles it. We are currently in the process of moving away from tree-sitter and instead using the parsers provided by the languages themselves where possible.GumTree is good at returning a result quickly, but there are quite a few cases where it always returned bad matches for us, no matter how many follow-up papers with improvements we tried to implement. In the end we switched over to a dijkstra based approach that tries to minimize the cost of the mapping, which is more computationally expensive but gives much better results. Difftastic uses a similar approach as well.[1]: https://semanticdiff.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tool has an excellent architecture section [0] that goes into how it works under the hood.  It stands out to me that a complex tool has an overview to this depth that allows you to grasp conceptually how it works.0 - https://mergiraf.org/architecture.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going through the sorts of conflicts it solves, and limitations in that, I find it claiming that in some insertions, order doesn’t matter &lt;https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html#neighbouring-insertions-...&gt;.I really don’t like that. At the language level, order may not matter, but quite frequently in such cases the order does matter, insofar as almost every human would put the two things in a particular order; or where there is a particular convention active. If you automatically merge the two sides in a different order from that, doing it automatically has become harmful.My clearest example: take Base `struct Foo; struct Bar;`, then between these two items, Left inserts `impl Foo { }`, Right inserts `struct Baz;`. To the computer, the difference doesn’t matter, but merging it as `struct Foo; struct Baz; impl Foo { } struct Bar;` is obviously bad to a human. This is the problem: it’s handling language syntax semantics, but can’t be aware of logical semantics. (Hope you can grasp what I’m trying to convey, not sure of the best words.) Left was not inserting something between Foo and Bar, it was attaching something to the end of Foo. Whereas Right was probably inserting something between Foo and Bar—but maybe even it was inserting something before Bar. You perceive that these are all different things, logically.Another example where this will quickly go wrong: in CSS rulesets, some will sort the declarations by property name lexicographically, some by property name length (seriously, it’s frequently so pretty), some will group by different types of property… you can’t know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093756</guid></item><item><title>6.

And glad to see it's MIT licensed.I wonder if it is feasible to use this as a replacement for p2k, instapaper etc for the purpose of reading on Kindle. One annoyance with these services is that the rendering is way off -- h elements not showing up as headers, elements missing randomly, source code incorrectly rendered in 10 different ways. Some are better than others, but generally they are disappointing. (Yet they expect you to pay a subscription fee.) If this is an actively maintained project that welcomes contribution, I could test it out with various articles and report/fix issues. Although I wonder how much work there will be for handling edge cases of all the websites out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093511</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this app, makes it really easy to keep non-store apps up to date by linking directly to the apps GitHub repo for example.Obviously you have to be careful what you install, just as with any app not found in Play Store, but if you're getting your apps elsewhere anyway this is really convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use this and it's great. Only problem is when: 1) you want something outside of github (from my experience, already gitlab and codeberg can be buggy here, although very rarely), and 2) when you need a specific release channel (example: Firefox Beta, which requires a bit of work). But overall it works great. Now, one has to consider the security aspects: stores like Google Play (and, to a lesser extent, F-Droid) do perform some antimalware checks. It's not bulletproof, but it gives a bit more trust in case the dev goes rogue or is compromised. BUT you have to trust the store. With Obtainium, you have to trust: 1) the app's developer 2) Github/Gitlab/Codeberg 3) Obtainium's developer. So, it depends what's your threat model. I'm looking forward to seeing wider adoption for Accrescent!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's weird how many orgs keep their apps unavailable, as lots of users decline to submit to Play store preconditions (link phone to a Google account).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026251</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The website introduces Open Encoder, a project focused on enhancing large language models (LLMs) through efficient encoding techniques. It emphasizes the goals of improving performance and scalability in natural language processing tasks, offers insights into the methodologies used for optimization, and provides resources including documentation, research papers, and tools for developers interested in implementing advanced encoding strategies in their own LLM applications. Additionally, it invites collaboration and contributions from the research community to further refine these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

Asked it to change a few things in a ~6KB C# snippet in a somewhat ambiguous, but reasonable way.GPT-4 did this job perfectly. Qwen:72b did half of the job, completely missed the other one, and renamed 1 variable that had nothing to do with the question. Llama3.1:70b behaved very similar to Qwen, which is interesting.OpenCoder:8b started reasonably well, then randomly replaced "Split('\n')" with "Split(n)" in unrelated code, and then went completely berserk, hallucinating non-existent StackOverflow pages and answers.For posterity, I saved it here: https://pastebin.com/VRXYFpzrMy best guess is that you shouldn't train it on mostly code. Natural language conversations used to train other models let them "figure out" human-like reasoning. If your training set is mostly code, it can produce output that looks like code, but it will have little value to humans.Edit: to be fair, llama3.2:3b also botched the code. But it did not hallucinate complete nonsense at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering why Figure 1 showed a HumanEval score of 61.6 for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, but Table 1 shows a score of 88.4, i. e. better than this new model with a score of 66.5.The reason is that those are actually two different models (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base with 61.6, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct with 88.4).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095580</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one in a long line of posts saying "we took a model and made it smaller" and now it can run with different requirements.It is important to keep in mind that modifying a model changes the performance of the resulting model, where performance is "correctness" or "quality" of output.Just because the base model is very performant does not mean the smaller model is.This means that another model that is the same size as the new quantized model may outperform the quantized model.Suppose there are equal sized big models A and B with their smaller quantized variants a and b. A being a more performant model than B does not guarantee a being more performant than b.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demo on actual 4090 with flux schnell for next few hours: https://5jkdpo3rnipsem-3000.proxy.runpod.net/Its basically H100 speeds with 4090, 4.80it/s. 1.1 sec for flux schenll(4 steps) and 5.5 seconds for flux dev(25 steps). Compared to normal speeds(comfyui fp8 with "--fast" optimization") which is 3 seconds for schnell and 11.5 seconds for dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm convinced the path to ubiquity (such as embedded in smartphones) is quantization.I had to int4 a llama model to get it to properly run on my 3060.I'm curious, how much resolution / significant digits do we actually need for most genAI work? If you can draw a circle with 3.14, maybe it's good enough for fast and ubiquitous usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093112</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "Why I Quit Google," the author, Matt Lynch, shares his personal experience and reasons for leaving his job at Google. He discusses how, despite the benefits of working at a prestigious tech company, he felt increasingly disillusioned by the corporate culture, bureaucracy, and lack of meaningful impact on important projects. Lynch emphasizes the importance of passion in work and the desire for personal fulfillment, leading him to pursue new opportunities aligned with his values and interests. Overall, the piece serves as a reflection on career satisfaction and the search for a more purpose-driven path.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the same author has also published an interesting series of "annual review" blog posts summarising his progress trying to get different software businesses off the ground -- including being quite open about the finances. If you're interested in boostrapping a software business, and haven't seen them, they're well worth reading:https://mtlynch.io/tags/annual-review/https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you learned the most important lesson of any career: the customer is not your customer. The person/people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers.Think about it like this. A customer is the entity that exchanges money for something they value; like a good or service. That's usually your manager. Or in the case of OP the promotion committee. (Many times it's both your manager and the promotion committee). They are the ones who directly control your money (raise, bonus, promotion, etc).With that perspective in mind it makes sense to manage your career as a business where you're doing things to increase the rate at which you deliver value to the entity which can trade money for that value.Many of the setbacks you faced are very common when trying to run your own business. The customer changes their mind, the market shifts the goal posts, you realize you're focusing on the wrong things. Like a business you have to constantly change your strategy and adapt to the customer; not the other way around. Why? Because the customer can very easily get their goods or services from someone else if you can't deliver what they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I agree with this. The breaking projects before completion is very annoying, but also the author seems like they were only there for a promotion? I mean a promotion is nice, but it was never really explained why that was such a dealbreaker. If the only thing keeping you at your job is the prospect of a better title, that's probably a bad sign. They then made a lifetime's worth of money at Google in four years, and then used that financial stability to do something high risk which most people can't afford to do. Regardless, I'm glad they've found work that resonates with them!

&lt;p&gt;Jaws is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of building and deploying applications using the JAWS (JavaScript API Wrapper &amp; Scheduler) framework. It simplifies tasks such as managing dependencies, running applications, and deployment configurations, thereby enhancing productivity for developers. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and examples, making it accessible for both new and experienced users of the JAWS framework. Additionally, it emphasizes community contributions, encouraging collaboration and improvements to the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

All the JS -&gt; WASM compilers so far have basically just been shipping a whole JS engine - this is the first one I've seen that actually tries to map JS constructs directly to WASM primitives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day I did an almost-Typescript (though much closer than assembly script) to embedded ARM compiler. Some of the techniques may be useful.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As much as I love writing Rust, I also know it's not a widely popular languageIs this true?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential for HPV vaccination to eliminate cervical cancer globally. It highlights the significant role that human papillomavirus (HPV) plays in cervical cancer development, emphasizing how vaccination can dramatically reduce incidence rates. The piece provides data on vaccination coverage worldwide, the disparities in access between countries, and the need for increased efforts to promote vaccination programs. It also outlines the benefits of early detection and treatment, advocating for a comprehensive approach that combines vaccination with screening to achieve the goal of eradicating cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s funny how in the US the vaccine schedule says not to get the HPV vaccine if you’re over 45. That means that insurance won’t cover it and I even struggle finding a doctor who will administer it because it goes against the guidelines.The rationale is that if you’re 45, you probably already have HPV. But that assumes that you’ve been sexually active all that time. It doesn’t take into account people who were monogamous until their 50s and then started having sex with new partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we had therapeutic vaccines against HPV. As a man, I always got told "it's not for men", followed by "it is also for men, but only if you never had sex", followed by "it's also for men who had sex, but only to a limited age".As a male who meets all the criteria to be in a high risk group for HPV throat cancer, and who is dealing with a persistent HPV infection (as proved by warts that won't go away), I'm really sad that I may one day at a young age get cancer in my throat, and there is nothing I can do about it to prevent it. I wish we would put the same amount of energy into inventing vaccines that suppress the virus, or help the body to get rid of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The HPV vaccine has been a universal win for this generation.  Screening (pap smear) is also highly effective, but requires constant effort.The remaining gaps in screening and vaccine uptake reflect broader lack of health-care capabilities that won't be solved with pushing the HPV vaccine alone.  Changing from injectable to oral could help, but isn't on the table, and local populations and governments are likely to become increasingly resistant to outsiders waving their science authorities, particularly on family matters.Both authors are Phd's working in outreach - i.e., they seem to have no experience with deploying HPV campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045373</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the court's decision in Heckman v. Live Nation, where Ticketmaster's attempt to enforce arbitration clauses in its ticket purchase agreements was largely unsuccessful. The court ruled that the arbitration terms were unconscionable and unenforceable, highlighting concerns about unfairness and lack of transparency in the arbitration process. The decision sets a precedent for consumer rights, indicating that companies cannot impose one-sided arbitration clauses that could disadvantage consumers. The author emphasizes the importance of this ruling in challenging overreaching contractual practices in the ticketing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I won't agree to arbitration services at all, if it removes your right to sue.  I have been burned in the past by a manifestly unfair arbitration decision.  We submitted our evidence, they asked the other side for their response.  The other side lied, and provided no evidence.  The arbitration service simply decided in the other parties favor; we were allowed no rebuttal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitration seems like how courts-martials were in the early days... completely lopsided in favor of the State, except it's corporations now.  Either we get rid of arbitration (which I don't think is gonna happen) or there needs to be regulations to bring it under control (whatever that may be, i have no idea myself).Almost every service I use has, over time, switched me over to require the use of arbitration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US arbitration law is weird. A particularly bizarre one is that a judge did not find it possible to strike down an arbitration agreement where there arbitrator is part of the organisation being complained of:https://archive.is/mIfMs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42047027</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new technique called Early Cascade Injection, which enhances the stealthiness of code injection during the Windows process creation phase. It details how this method allows attackers to infiltrate processes more discreetly by leveraging the early stages of process initialization, thereby avoiding detection by conventional security measures. The piece emphasizes the implications for cybersecurity, urging defenders to adapt their strategies in light of this advanced injection technique.&lt;/p&gt;

I need to talk with the current development team about reviewing it with the EDR-Preloading technique. We have a driver also that suspends a new process before hooking it, we also hook existing processes.Business-wise our work on this went down once Microsoft Detours was made FOSS even when our products has other capabilities. A good old thread is here [4].[1] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2[2] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare-InProc[3] https://github.com/nektra/RemoteBridge[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/22crn0/gpl_alt...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all overriding and detouring is malicious.  For instance, Steam detours Direct3D every time you launch a game in order to set up the steam overlay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the call to WriteProcessMemory or creating suspended processes isn't being picked up, it usually gets you a lot of points on the "Detect binary as malware heuristic" detector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095752</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Zig, a programming language that offers a unique syntax and structure compared to traditional languages. It highlights the language's features, such as its focus on performance and safety, and provides examples of how its syntax encourages clear and concise code. The author explains various elements of the Zig programming language, including its approach to error handling, memory management, and compile-time execution, aiming to illustrate why Zig may be an appealing choice for developers seeking a more efficient and readable coding experience. Overall, the piece serves as an introduction to Zig's unconventional syntax and its benefits in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even more unfriendly-yet-typical line is where you create an allocator, and few lines further you run allocator() method on it, to get ...an allocator (but you had it already! Or maybe you didn't ?) Same: you create Writer, but then you run a writer() method on it.Here is the code to illustrate:    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();
    var visited = std.BufSet.init(arena.allocator());

    var bw = std.io.bufferedWriter(std.io.getStdOut().writer());
    const stdout = bw.writer();

So.. what are the entities we use, conceptually? "allocatorButNotReally" and "thisTimeReallyAnAllocatorIPromise"? Same for the writer?Plus, the documentation isn't much explaining wtf is this and why.The answer is probably buried somewhere in forums history, blogs and IRC logs, because there must have been consensus established why is it ok to write code like that. But, the lack of clear explanation is not helping with casual contact with the language. It's rather all-or-nothing - either you spend a lot of time daily in tracking all the media about the ecosystem, or you just don't get the basics. Not good IMO. (and yes I like a lot about the language).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As people have pointed already elsewhere, the same declaration can be made more clear by isolating the type like so:    var gpa: std.mem.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}) = .{};&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you've been writing zig for a while, seeing `.{}` in an argument list intuitively means "default arguments".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42050954</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1960s, Ford has been storing vintage cars in an underground cave in Kansas City to protect them from the elements and preserve their condition. This unique storage facility, known as the "Ford Motor Company Underground," houses over 600 vehicles, including classic models and prototypes. The initiative not only serves to safeguard automotive history but also supports future restoration and preservation efforts, showcasing the brand's commitment to its heritage. The site highlights the fascinating connection between Ford and its collection, emphasizing the significance of these vehicles in the context of the company's legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re government cheese..."The story of “government cheese” started with Jimmy Carter’s campaign promise to support the price of milk (specifically, to support a $0.06/gallon price increase). Consider it a rare campaign promise that happened to be kept, though it wasn’t completely thought through."Enforcing a higher price for something commonly either means restricting supply or increasing demand. In this case, supporting the price increase meant that the government had to buy milk en masse. What happens when you buy lots of milk? You discover that it does not keep well. That in turn led to the milk being converted into other forms that last longer: cheese, primarily. The other benefit of cheese being its greater density — producing one pound of cheese requires roughly 10 pounds of milk."But then what to do with the cheese? At first, the government just stored the cheese, where it apparently filled most of the large-scale cold storage in the US. (Rough cost for one year of the milk price support program (1981): $2 billion paid to dairy farmers in price support and $120 million in storage.)"
https://unintendedconsequenc.es/food-from-thought/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a similar facility called Iron Mountain in Boyers, PA that stores, among other things, millions of government records:https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/01/inside-iron-mountain.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a ton of facilities like this for storage of various stuff in middle America.  The limestone geology (there was once a sea between the Appalachian and Rockies) lend itself well to them.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Grim Fandango," a landmark video game released in 1998, known for its unique blend of film noir and Mexican culture as it follows the story of Manny Calavera, a travel agent in the Land of the Dead. It highlights the game's innovative use of 3D graphics and intricate storytelling, as well as its influence on the adventure game genre. The author reflects on the game's themes of life, death, and redemption, along with its memorable characters and puzzles, and considers its legacy in the gaming industry. The piece encapsulates why Grim Fandango continues to resonate with fans and maintains a significant place in video game history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well I certainly cannot relate to the criticism. I played the game early on as a teen (and every few years since) and while, at times difficult, I never thought the puzzles were "confusing", it seemed like a pretty organic combination of styles of puzzles built into the game. The head turning dynamics I have also found to be quiet pleasant as it made me relate to the character more.Not that criticism is bad but Grim Fandango seems to one of the most if not most loved adventure games (just visit and adventure game forum or subreddit). So one can take it apart and think about the individual parts but the whole is certainly a masterpiece of a game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one understated problem Grim Fandango had is that it's too adult.Today "adult" often means "there's sex and/or gore", but the content is still simple and juvenile. But Grim Fandango isn't like that, it's just full of themes that probably confused the heck out of almost every kid that tried to play it.Like the very first chapter throws you right into office politics. You deal with stealing a job from another salesman, sabotage a pneumatic tube messaging system, and sneak into your boss' office.It all makes perfect sense for adults familiar with office work and all the movies it references. But I recall I tried it when I was maybe 14 and I couldn't make head nor tails of it. I didn't even realize the pneumatic tubes were actually a thing.Things like Monkey Island and even Full Throttle are far more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how Lua "has gone on to become a staple language of modern game development", but could have given more credit to Grim Fandango for that. It was the first game to use Lua and and its success was what put the language on the map when it comes to gamedev.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097261</guid></item><item><title>18.

ML just gets more people to read it, which I guess is ok. I mean, you could just use "statistics" here in much the same way.I remember an advisor once telling me: once you figure out what a paper is really about, rewrite it, and remove the stuff you used to think it was about. The title of this paper should be about the new side channel, not about the ML story, imho.But this is just a nitpick. Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderful article.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was remarkably little in the way of security for early satellites (or space probes).I recently encountered here on HN the suggestion that, the main reason you can't find particularly in-depth details on the Voyager space probes, is project security.  Security through obscurity, mostly.  If amateurs can detect the signal from the Voyager probes with a small dish antenna, it's at least conceivable someone might hook up a really powerful transmitter, aim it in the probe's direction, and start issuing commands.  There's no cryptography, of course.  The resources required to hijack like that in the 1970s would have been much greater, and I doubt being hacked was much on the designer's minds.The Apollo Program was the same; today anyone with the documentation, a small dish antenna, a software radio, and some nerd dedication, would be able to hack Apollo midflight via its radio link.  It was the equivalent of a root prompt with no password on an exposed port.A bit closer to home, there's a tremendous amount of semi-functional orbital junk with a similar lack of security, decades-old computers still waiting for telecommands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This didn't happen recently. From the article:&gt;Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events.

&lt;p&gt;OuteTTS is a text-to-speech model developed by OuteAI, designed to generate human-like speech from written text. It is based on a robust architecture with 350 million parameters, enabling it to produce high-quality audio outputs. The model is suitable for various applications, including voiceovers for videos, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. The page provides details on how to use the model, its capabilities, and links to access it on the Hugging Face platform, along with sample outputs to demonstrate its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW I was really impressed by the results of F5-TTS. The thing I liked best was the "Tagged" TTS, where you can specify a tag to use different tones of your own voice, like  {Angry}What have you done?
  {Suprised}Me, I did nothing?
  {Shouting}Who else do you think I'm talking to?
  {Sad}Why are you always shouting at me?

I wonder if this would also work for "Character" tags, like  {Susan}How was your day?
  {Peter}I had a great day.

That would open great new ways of having audio books read by cloned voices - switching between characters with the same voice like often done by the real narrators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a quick try results aren't good. Sounds bland, and the text I type isn't exactly equal to the text that is spoken. Didn't try with voice cloning though.Why is good TTS so expensive and why are there no good open source options? Is it just from the need for high quality training data? I don't imagine these models are more expensive to run compared to SOTA LLMs, yet they cost so much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve had great luck so far with GPT-SoVITS. With a custom trained Japanese model and clean reference audio the quality is outstanding.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice. I've had occasion to import/export, edit, etc. thousands of CSV files from multiple software platforms over the years and this tool looks like a simple way for a user to determine whether there are issues in the CSV file that will cause problems on import to their application.One question I immediately have is how this compares to a spreadsheet CSV import tool such as the one in Excel which is extremely flexible. It appears that this app requires a specific format (comma delimited, new line at end of each row) in order to work. I never tried to count the times that a CSV file that I had to work with required editing in order to facilitate import to Excel or other application because CSV is such a non-standard standard output that the only way one could know whether the import would be successful was to pop it into an editor, like Notepad++ and examine it before import. Notepad++ was a critical tool in the chain to force compliance for all the different applications I used. Each application allowed CSV import/export but some accepted almost any delimiter while others were strict about file format and failing to understand the expected CSV format for each would definitely cause headaches as some input errors could leave a very subtle footprint that you may not catch until late in processing.Anyway, it appears that your definition of CSV format is pretty strict so how do you propose that a user manage importation of files that do not fit your CSV definition? Notepad++ before import to verify compliance?I also see one thing on the main page under "Security" that looks like it could be worded differently.&gt;No tracking or analytics software is used for privacyTo me, this implies that no steps have been taken to manage user/data privacy.Perhaps a comma could be inserted so that it reads "...used, for privacy." or maybe it should read:For (user/data) privacy, there is no tracking or analytics software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work!Do you have any plans for data cleaning?I am working on a somewhat similar open source project.  I intend to add heuristic data cleaning.  With the UI I want to be able to toggle between different strategies quickly - strip characters from a column to treat it as numeric, if less than 2% or 5% of values have a character, fill na with mean, interpret dates in different formats - drop if the date doesn't parse.  The idea bing that if it's really quick to change between different strategies, you can create more opinionated strategies to get to the right answer faster.Happy to collaborate and talk tables with anyone who's interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! Does anyone know of any javascript libraries that I could use to get this type of distribution visualisation from tabular data? Something I can run on my site that is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42096837</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a concise history of Cyrix, a company known for its role in the x86 processor market during the 1990s. It discusses the foundation of Cyrix in 1988, its development of innovative processors that aimed to compete with Intel and AMD, and its strategic partnerships and product releases. The piece highlights the company's challenges, including legal battles and market competition, which ultimately led to its acquisition by VIA Technologies in 1999. It reflects on Cyrix's legacy and contributions to computing, especially in enhancing performance and affordability during the era.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I owe my entire career to the high school internship I had in the IT department at Cyrix in Richardson, circa 1996. It was awesome. Learned everything about building PCs for employees and Windows networking. So much free hardware walked out the door -- usually stuff that was slightly out of date, just stacks of it everywhere.  Spent the next three summers there through college too. It was really exciting there at that time, Internet age just taking off. They had beer at 4PM on Fridays out back.Everything went downhill with the series of acquisitions. Anyway, I'm grateful for my time there... I can trace where I am now directly back to the guy who first gave me a chance there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s very interesting to learn about Cyrix and how innovative they happened to be. Back in the 90s most of us, at least in Europe, learned about Cyrix from either friends or shop clerks. And back then Cyrix had a terrible reputation, they were considered almost as illegal Intel CPU clones. AMD also had a terrible reputation until they released their Socket 7 AMD K6 CPUs and later on their Super Socket 7 K6-2, K6-3 CPU’s just before their amazing Athlon and Duron family. Cyrix never regained any reputation, and slowly their offerings ended up mixed with VIA or Centaur CPUs. Celeron and AMD CPU’s were already cheap enough so no one was buying Cyrix anymore to just save $20-$30 on a $1000 computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a Cyrix 486 somewhere around 1992. Working with Windows NT and Visual C++ turned up subtle problems that could be worked around with some compiler switches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42035990</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Write a Book" on Parenthetically Speaking provides a comprehensive guide for aspiring authors, outlining the key steps to successfully write and publish a book. It emphasizes the importance of defining one's purpose, creating a writing schedule, and developing a clear outline. Additionally, the article offers tips on drafting, revising, and seeking feedback, as well as advice on navigating the publishing process, whether through traditional publishing or self-publishing. The overall aim is to empower writers by demystifying the writing process and encouraging them to share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree. I DID write a book! https://howtoopensource.dev/My biggest tip is this: Don’t skip getting beta readers. High quality feedback is really hard to come by. I changed my tool chain to add a google form at the end of each chapter and got strong buy in from a handful of people with the finished first draft in a beta state. In the end some bailed but one left amazing feedback resulting in massive structural changes.The process of writing a book is two things (to me). The most obvious is sharing information. The second, often overlooked, but biggest benefit IMHO is how you will grow and learn the source material even better than you already do. Even if you don’t ever publish it, it’s still worthwhile to putting in the effort to write a book. GLHF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a university lecturer, I have interviewed many people… academics and admins. I have taught in many S E Asian universities and multi-lingualism is the norm, with English assumed to be the ‘Lingua franca’. Almost everyone I interview claims to have ‘excellent’ skills in written and spoken English. Almost none of them could produce so much as a single paragraph of English that did not burn my eyes.Prior to starting writing my first book, I had already accumulated some experience in academic writing. I thought it would be a doddle. I can honestly say that it was one of the most demanding experiences of my life.The worst thing is the degree to which I was blind to my own shortcomings… just like all those people I interviewed.Moral of the story… "writing is easy; you just stare at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead"  (Gene Fowler).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The challenge is not writing a book, but letting it go.I wrote Understanding SEO https://fullstackoptimizatio.gumroad.com/l/understanding-seo...4 times. Each time it took me a year. The last time together with an editor. And I could have gone on, over every word, every sentence again. In the end my editor forces me.  In the end you just have to publish it, otherwise it does not exist.Still think I did good, even after more than 7 years I still sell a few paper and some more e copies per month just by WOM, so yeah, must be some value in there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42096915</guid></item><item><title>27.

I am happy that the researchers are putting it out there to attract interest and investment, but the GRI-type insulins remained in lab settings for about 30 years now and it is somewhat troubling to not see progression into and through the stages of pharma clinical trials on T1D patients.Clearly, there is tremendous potential to make money here – diabetes is a very serious epidemic worldwide. So why hasn't this progressed out of the lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO: This is the closest thing to a "cure" coming out in the next decade. Like a couple injections a day, wearing a CGM to make sure it is working, no calculations, no worry about carb intake.A lot of the other "cures"  involve immunosuppressants which have a ton of bad side effects that can be worse than diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008891</guid></item><item><title>28.

And your agedmother will have to pay the fines, making her homeless."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never talk to the police.

Do recommend it.https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study is specifically about "learning" that takes place without interacting with the brain.It's learning in the same sense the immune system learns to fight of infections. The difference is that the mechanism by which cells record state is similar to one of the mechanisms also used by the brain at the cellular level, which you would expect.The cells and structures that make up the brain evolved from simpler structures, so we would expect some reuse of mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings up the question about whether there are hereditary information transmission methods other than DNA. There are so many things we ascribe to “instinct” that might be information transmitted from parent to offspring in some encoded format.Like songs that newborn songbirds know, migration routes that animals know without being shown, that a mother dog should break the amniotic sac to release the puppies inside, what body shapes should be considered  more desirable for a mate out of an infinite variety of shapes.It seems it implausible to me that all of these things can be encoded as chemical signalling; it seems to require much more complex encoding of information, pattern matching, templates, and/or memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094427</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you start hitting performance issues with Rails, switch to using Arel for queries and pump the data into lightweight classes. ActiveRecord optimization magic is a foot bazooka.If you want to reuse the code between these objects and the corresponding ActiveRecord model, do it with a module.The biggest problem with Rails is that people get so glued to the conventions that everything gets shoehorned into a model or controller instead of using a better abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another approach are materialized views, where you basically create a caching table with exactly the fields you need. Can be used for any query, but particularly valuable for rich reporting where you may be pulling data from all over your associations. It requires you to write the source query in raw SQL, but with the Scenic gem, pulls it into the Active Record ecosystem with models, migrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post covering many of the main ways to improve efficiency.Here’s a related post I wrote for AppSignal:What's Coming in Ruby on Rails 7.2: Database Features in Active Record https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/07/24/whats-coming-in-ruby-o...For folks interested in additional depth on optimizing Postgres for use with Active Record/Rails, please check out my book:High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails https://andyatkinson.com/pgrailsbookThanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42059650</guid></item><item><title>32.

Your documentation mentions captcha but are we talking specifically Google Recaptcha or hcaptcha or any captcha provider?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great stuff. Have set it up on my local.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses iterative alpha deblending, a technique used in computer graphics to improve the quality of images that have been blended with transparency. It explains the challenges of traditional alpha blending, particularly in preserving detail and achieving realistic results. The author presents a method for refining the blending process through iterative calculations, which helps in eliminating artifacts and enhances the visual fidelity of the final image. Additionally, practical implementation details and examples are provided to guide readers in applying this technique in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to join a community of like-minded technical folks. The group isn't what the "old men with radios" stereotype would suggest either.[1] https://www.arrl.org/news/amateur-radio-provides-communicati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick plug for anyone who may be interested in ham but a little intimidated by the license that’s required. Contact your local ham club or group (I guarantee you there is one). Ours had a fast track to getting people licensed. It amounted to a one day cram course immediately before the technician’s exam (the oddly named entry level license) with a 90+% pass rate. The philosophy is to get people licensed and on board and interested and THEN start learning. It’s kind of a counter intuitive strategy but it certainly got me involved where I wouldn’t have been otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037750</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NASA's lack of communication regarding an incident involving a SpaceX Crew Dragon splashdown that resulted in crew members being sent to the hospital. Despite the significance of the event, NASA has not publicly addressed the situation or provided details about what occurred during the re-entry and landing process.

The cosmonaut who spent the longest continuous time in space was Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 days in zero G in the early 1990s, came back fine, had a good career after returning, and recently died at age 80.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could it be an initially-unnoticed chemical leak in the Crew Dragon? That could explain how it hospitalized four astronauts at once, and also why they're uncharacteristically afraid of media coverage. They were evasive in a similar way when Starliner was first having issues—they're scared of the politics, or of the lawyers.edit to add: These spacecraft all use very toxic fuels, and this one has had issues with fuel leaks before [0]. I'm not sure how or if those could affect the crew. Maybe if there was contamination on an exterior surface, they could have been exposed on landing? IIRC it is or used to be standard procedure to take air samples before opening crewed spacecraft, for this reason.edited again to add: I found it! It Apollo-Soyuz in 1975—the entire Apollo crew were poisoned by fuel when they opened the spacecraft, and were hospitalized with chemical pneumonitis [1,2].[0] https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-delays-cargo-dr...

The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in Honolulu, Hawaii.[22] Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believed he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and begun drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.[23]"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42092385</guid></item><item><title>42.

Historically at least, Ada compilers were infamous for requiring many passes and being consequently slow.Whether it is still acceptable for a programming language to require forward declaration seems to me rather a matter of personal taste.  Sure, compilers improved and there's plenty of memory for them to use, but human programmers' capacity increased little, if any, I'd think.  I think of those forward declarations as form of double-entry bookkeeping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once did an engineering camp at the Air Force academy and in one of the classes we programmed Lego mindstorms with Ada - something like https://www.adacore.com/academia/projects/real-time-mindstor...I do wish we had better options for embedded!

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.htmlI feel it's quite unfair for the title to call out sqlite on checksums, when in reality, as the very closing line of the article states most databases don't do checksum verifications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sqlite is the wrong layer at which to care about storage hardware failures. That would be the job of the disks themselves, the hardware or software volume manager, or filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The checksum in the WAL is to detect incomplete writes (due to crash or power failure).

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing from this, but very important: you can connect to the same SQLite database file multiple times inside the same process (e.g. in different threads) but you can also connect to the same SQLite database file from multiple different processes on the same machine (with the same filesystem - NFS will lead to all kinds of nasty problems).Easy way to prove this to yourself: run two different terminals, run "sqlite3 data.db" in each one, run create table / insert / update queries in one and watch the results become visible to selects in the other.Changes only become visible to other connections after they have been committed.In default mode any writes will hold an exclusive lock and will cause any reads to be blocked waiting for that lock. In WAL mode reads can continue even while writes are taking place.Writes can only run one at a time, but can queue waiting for each other to finish - and since most writes take microseconds to run this is very rarely a problem.The most complicated thing to understand is the need to use BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION in concurrent environments to avoid the occasional SQLITE_BUSY exception. The best explanation I've seen of this is here: https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-rails-t... - search for SQLITE_BUSY.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just dealt with a lot of sqlite concurrency stuff recently. When I first got started, a lot of recommendations were that apps should create a connection and hold that connection its the duration. This works great but I feel like it's worth noting that this can get dangerous when you're working in a multi-threaded context.You can have one thread in the middle of stepping through the results of a SELECT prepared statement and if another thread resets the statement and runs it again, that original thread will start stepping through the results from the other thread's call.  Or if both threads begin a transaction, you'll get nested transaction errors.Things get really confusing, especially because you might not notice the problems until the app is running on a slower machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are benefits to having a single writer connection (and multiple readers).One is that you can get fairer and more efficient locking. The (interruptible) file lock APIs that SQLite uses lead to a lot of sleeping and retrying that wastes time, and is not very fair.https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/07/19/sqlite-in-ruby-ba...Another some APIs, like the backup API, work better if they can track writes, and (e.g.) backing up from the single writer connection helps there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095012</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strongly disagree. Easily 99% of people in biology are doing very tedious boring things. Maybe you just don’t hear about it because it’s “boring”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software engineering and finance have completely sucked the air out of the STEM room.I'll be surprised if in a generation anyone in the US knows how to build anything other than JavaScript apps and swap agreements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post doesn't address the elephant in the room -- wages in biology seem to be supressed due to an oversupply of life sciences scientists willing to do tasks in various corporate and academic labs.Since life science wages (rewards) seem to be so low compared to other careers in relation to the density of advanced degree holders, the ambitions need to be that much bigger to make it worth it to found uncertain and risky startups. Only big ideas would be worth funding. Ecosystem tooling startups might be founded once more capital for that category trickles in.&gt;&gt;And I have no doubt that Patrick Collinson — the CEO of Stripe [...]Patrick's last name is Collison, not Collinson, as per the wikipedia link that the blog post references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095513</guid></item><item><title>47.

I can't stress how important his talk was in the overall success of htmx, and I'm glad he followed up on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My only counter is that for a real-time collaborative app the server should be the single source of truth about application state, which would make htmx a good choice for that type of application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any major websites using htmx?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091909</guid></item><item><title>48.

But then ten sentences later:&gt; Of course, you aren't going to write your UI in C, only an idiot would do that. Instead, you want to write it in some kind of markup language.Now, let me think of some markup language that is universally known and has at least some pretence to be about laying out information on a screen... Thats right, html.The thing with UI frameworks in the 21st century of flying cars, AGI and rapidly approaching Singularity, is that its a stagnating mess.There should be a nice, standardized, cross-platform, easy to get started and progressively expandable way to build high quality visual apps. For some elusive reason, we cant have good things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trivial examples of Gtk+ apps seem to be legion but to find a decent tutorial that works its way through a moderately complex and usable app seem to be scarce.  In particular I haven't found a decent example of using the GTKBuilder class and complete documentation of the XML properties seems almost nonexistent.Aside from that, instead of writing a GNOME app in C, isn't Vala or GJS the preferred language now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post but the images don't load for me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070807</guid></item><item><title>1.

From the home page:&gt; These videos come from YouTube. They were uploaded in the last week and have titles like DSC 1234 and IMG 4321. They have almost zero previous views. They are unnamed, unedited, and unseen (by anyone but you).At one point you might be at a school recital in Malaysia, and the next minute you are at a birthday in Ecuador. It's amazing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little bit tangent, and I'm definitely looking at it from rose colored glasses... but been playing with it for the 30 minutes, and most of the videos look so real? Like when you go on TikTok / Instagram nowadays, there are obviously unlimited amount of content. But there's this sense of everything being edited multiple times, people trying to create their own "brand", nothing looking real. It's a shame how we over-financialized everything and sucked out the fun. Or maybe I just got old.Side note, I'll also recommend people to look up "X city in 1990s / 2000s" on YouTube. San Francisco, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Toronto, London and etc. have cool slice of life content from people who were very into camcorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102506</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was an excel enthusiast and studied accounting mainly for Excel. Although I have moved to programming unlike most I still do think Excel is awesome.I sincerely commend the enthusiasm, but working in the industry as the "excel expert", I think most outsider does not understand the "cult" aspect of Excel.Excel works. That is it.Trying to replace excel with anything will be percieved as replacing a calculator with some alien substance that does math. Excel is like Pencil and Pen. You can not replace it.Excel is not software it is a tool.I have had my fair share backlash when trying to introduce replacement and complimentary tools. To replace excel, you not only need to  advocate for it's usefulness and you need to be also be liable to the complaints from excel users. If anything goes wrong no how minor with the new tool, you are the one who introduced all these mess.So, in practice what usually happens is that, when people hit UX challenges they go to a consulting firm and commission a backoffice software to address the Excel limitations. Some business may pay for nocode but that is very rare. They go to backoffice software firm and they build a CRUD software that is now not replacing Excel but compliments it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! This is my project!
Amazed to see this here.
I'll try to answer questions people might have&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cool project, but I don't particularly like "The democratization of spreadsheets" as a catchphrase. Like, what does that even mean? If by "democratization" you mean like, more able to be used, well anyone can go download LibreOffice or for the web use CryptPad's Spreadsheets, and if you mean that it's more open, well both of those are open source. Is this project specifically run democratically or something? It just seems like a really bad use of meaningless marketing terminology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095292</guid></item><item><title>3.

One of our stops was supposed to be a fishing village, but when we got there, it was completely empty. Hundreds of mud huts sat abandoned as everyone had just disappeared. In one of the yards, a camel was still there. It felt haunting, like walking through a ghost town. The strangest part? There was no sea anywhere nearby!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is a bit confusing as open-source separation of ... reads like source separation, which this is not. Rather, it is a pitch detection algorithm which also classifies the instrument the pitch originated with.I think it's really neat, but the results look like it could take more time to fix the output than using a manual approach (if really accurate results are required).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see it referenced directly anywhere in this post. However, for those interested, automatic music transcription (i.e., audio-&gt;MIDI) is actually a decently sized subfield of deep learning and music information retrieval.There have been several successful models for multi-track music transcription - see Google's MT3 project (https://research.google/pubs/mt3-multi-task-multitrack-music...). In the case of piano transcription, accuracy is nearly flawless at this point, even for very low-quality audio:https://github.com/EleutherAI/aria-amtFull disclaimer: I am the author of the above repo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in audio (or stem) separation have a look at RipXhttps://hitnmix.com/ripx-daw-pro/It can even export the separated tracks as midi files. It still has some problems but works very well. Stem separation is now standard in the musical software and almost every DAW provides it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098491</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Shader Blocks explores the concept of using shader programming in graphics and game development, focusing on the use of simplified "blocks" to create visual effects. It provides an overview of how shader blocks can be utilized to manipulate light, color, and texture in a more intuitive way. The content includes examples, tutorials, and insights aimed at helping both beginners and experienced developers understand and implement shader techniques in their projects.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of suggestions.A clearer mechanism to indicate when a dragged component will fit into a cell of another node.   Quite often when you drag the highlighted drop area is obscured by the node you are dragging.pow(a,b) and abs(b), max(a,b), min(a,b) nodes would add a lot of functionality.Then you could do something like.    (((1 / abs((((0 - (y-0.5)) * 6) - ((sin(((((x-0.5) * 6) + time) * ((cos(time) / 3) + 2))) / 4) + pow(((x-0.5) * 2), 3))))) / 9) + (0 - pow((1 - min(abs((x-0.5), abs((y-0.5))), pow(9, 9))))

Which should generate a field with axis lines in negative numbers and a plot of x^3 modulated with a slight wobbly sine wave as positive numbers.as seen at https://c50.fingswotidun.com/show/?code=10v-6*u6*t%2Btc3%2F2...(note - in my thing u and v are shorthand values for 0.5-x and 0.5-y respectively)A perlin noise can add a lot too but not as trivial to add.  I have a compact perlin generator in the first few lines of https://c50.fingswotidun.com/fastStackie.js

Feel free to use the code if you understand any of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of node-based compositing, which is mostly standard in the film industry but, to the best of my knowledge, never made it to still-image editing applications.

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered a unique skeleton comprised of bones from at least eight individuals, each having died thousands of years apart, at a site in England. This perplexing find raises questions about the site's historical use and the cultural practices of the people who buried their dead in this manner. Researchers are investigating whether the skeleton represents a ritualistic amalgamation of remains or a more practical approach to burial. The discovery highlights the complexities of ancient burial customs and the potential for new insights into human history and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the Frontier Math Benchmark, an evaluation framework designed to assess the mathematical capabilities of artificial intelligence models, particularly in areas such as problem-solving and numerical reasoning. It outlines the benchmark's structure, which includes diverse problem types and complexity levels, aiming to provide standardized metrics for comparing AI performance. The initiative seeks to enhance understanding of AI’s strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, facilitating advancements in AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some context on why this is important: this benchmark was designed to be extremely challenging for LLMs, with problems requiring several hours or days of work by expert mathematicians. Currently, LLMs solve 2% of problems in the set (which is kept private to prevent contamination).They even provide a quote from Terence Tao, which helped create the benchmark (alongside other Field medalists and IMO question writers):&gt; “These are extremely challenging. I think that in the near term basically the only way to solve them, short of having a real domain expert in the area, is by a combination of a semi-expert like a graduate student in a related field, maybe paired with some combination of a modern AI and lots of other algebra packages…”Surprisingly, prediction markets [1] are putting 62% on AI achieving &gt; 85% performance on the benchmark before 2028.[1]: https://manifold.markets/MatthewBarnett/will-an-ai-achieve-8...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding keeping the test set private to avoid contamination, the comments about leakage are spot on. The real test set should always be the future.We should evaluate LLMs on text from beyond their knowledge cutoff date, by computing their per-byte perplexity or per-byte compression ratio. There's a deep theoretical connection between compression and learning.The intuition here is that being able to predict the future of science (or any topic, really) is indicative of true understanding. Slightly more formally: When ICLR 2025 announces and publishes the accepted papers, Yoshua Bengio is less surprised/perplexed by what's new than a fresh PhD student. And Terence Tao is less surprised/perplexed by what will be proven in math in the next 10 years than a graduate student in a related field.This work has it right: https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html//2402.00861&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they solve the 2%? This is the question. If those problems were unseen, that might be already very impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094546</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suffered from this.The issue is the ego. Ego has a lot of ideas about itself and others. Ego has such high opinion about itself it only can do great work. Which prevents it from doing anything. It's kind of a way of avoiding failures. Because failures will break the grant ideas about himself OP has created.I accidentally went through a spiritual awakening which diluted ego. I have no problem in doing any kind of work now. Whether it's great or petty.OP needs to work on the ego. Or figure out a situation where OP has to ship things no matter what. Which is hard unless you are jobless and can't figure a way out apart from building useful things that people pay for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I struggle with this myself, especially around writing. My solution, from a coding perspective:If I had a massive new app to build, it would indeed feel overwhelming if I felt like I just had to sit down and build it. I think we get extra stuck on that with writing, as it often feels like we just need to go from an empty page to a well-reasoned and edited blog post, with a lot of ambiguous struggle in between.With programming, I start breaking it down into pieces of functionality, and smaller ones, until I have a list of concrete things I can actually get my head around and write the code for. I keep on doing those small things, build the structure around them, and eventually I have my app.I do the same with writing now. Not an outline really, but a list of concepts I want to get across, then smaller ideas. I write out a few of those, often a paragraph at a time. The structure starts to reveal itself, and soon enough I have a new blog post.I think the key here is arriving at something small enough that it doesn't feel overwhelming. New app or blog post feels like way too much in the moment, and my body and mind to everything possible to avoid it (procrastination). Writing out a paragraph, coding a function - very doable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will repeat my standard advice for writing more: lower your standards, and allow yourself (in fact force yourself) to publish things despite knowing that they could be better if you just changed a few more things...Also, write about things you've learned and projects you've built: both of those are topics where you aren't expected to provide shining new insight never seen before online: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101327</guid></item><item><title>9.

First, standards you have to pay to obtain are a really, really bad thing. Second, I wish more effort would go into designing standards and implementations that aren't such an endless time sink when you need them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISO should be fined and abolished, and the money it took from taxpayers should be recuperated from the frauds that ran it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101181</guid></item><item><title>10.

By operating with the most expansive and inclusive definition of “culture” possible, one that includes both the quotidian and the extraordinary, Cabinet aims to foster curiosity about the world we have made and inhabit. We believe that curiosity is the very basis of ethics insofar as a deeper understanding of our social and material cultures encourages us both to be better custodians of the world and at the same time allows us to imagine it otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then there's the metaphorical "handle": a horse that "has a handle on him" is so well trained that one can put him in every situation just as if he had had a handle and could be picked up and set down at will...(it might be interesting to explore the relations between this notion and "handiness", or to how we say cars "handle" well)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070630</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The (unspoken?) goal is to do my laundry - and all the other domestic tasks, because that’s where human satisfaction can be unleashedGive me a moment1. All economics / markers of value are about human happiness / satisfaction - we claim it’s money but it’s only given a value by humans who want it.2. As soon as people get rich enough they outsource their domestic tasks - hire a maid or a cook, or buy ready meals.3. In the western world companies over past fifty years got a free boost as women joined the labour force, and essentially companies were paying one guy the cost of a household now they pay two people the cost of household getting twice the workers for same price.4. So most households have lost 35 hours a week, and also still have same amount of domestic duties to do5. As we can’t give everyone a maid we might be able to give everyone a robot maid.6. Most innovations / technologies find their way into homes - from bricks to heating to electricity we invent it and eventually find a way to make our lives more comfortable - see the point about economics is just humans liking stuff7. I assumed that real robo maids would be a social shift - ie a different design of washing machine, people eating at other peoples houses every day, anti-dust surfaces.  But this one looks … interesting8. I know this is incredibly western middle class centric - but exactly what else are 6 billon people aiming for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For factories and closed environments, stuff is getting good fast, but for the rest of the "real world", no robot or AI is practical without human supervision. I automate physical things for a living and have thus become convinced.The first thing that robot will do is start a dryer that a toddler climbed into because it isn't that aware of the world around it.And that will be the end of general purpose domestic robots.That or knocking over candles or fucking up something else simultaneously trivial and terribly dangerous in context.I dream the same dream of a general purpose machine, but I think it may never be possible, and if it is we're a long way out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hard problem for a laundry robot is not folding the clothes, it's getting into the laundry room.Living in European city, space is a hard constraint. The cost of rent is 30€ per square meter per month in Paris.Laundry rooms are small. This robot is too wide and won't be able to go through the door of my laundry room. Ironing boards are foldable for a reason : they need to be setup every time. This robot can't do it, and also can't handle the softener bottle for the washing machine.Having 1 square meter empty table (0.5 for the table and 0.5 accessible space for the robot doing the folding) dedicated to folding is a pipe dream for most. Laundromats are there because some don't have enough space to even have a washing machine.Laundry room are a dedicated space for humidity and ventilation reason, so they have been designed on specific location on house plans probably more than 30 years ago on average, not having in mind robot accessibility, but rather be as small as functionally possible.Quite often for people not living in flats, but in houses, the laundry room is located in the basement with only stair or single step access.I don't think architect and construction accessibility norm will change fast enough, specially with bipedal robots right around the corner.The slack necessary for home robotics emergence has already been eaten multiple time due to the high cost of space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098236</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve automagically recorded my digital piano musings starting about 28 years ago. Initially, I used a simple C code on a Linux server using select to dump from dev MIDI to a timestamped file per session (a variation of an answering machine I had previously hacked together with a friend). Later, I used pianoteq recording on an iMac, which also detects gaps and records separate timestamped files. The experience has been very positive and helpful for improving technique and composition, so I do recommend this hardware if you dont already record everything.  One piece of advice, however: you want to let people who touch your piano know they get recorded, or ask them to wait until you turn off the recording. I tend to forget that I record everything after a while, and an unsuspecting friend might incorrectly assume that their improv does not lead to a permanent record. I had several people be surprised when they first learned about the automatic recording after the fact, and had to remove one or two files at their request (though the last time I needed to remove a file was around 1998; more recently, people didn’t seem to mind).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, looks amazing!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it make sense for this to offer a chunking strategy that doesn't need a tokenizer at all? I love the goal to keep it small, but "tokenizers" is still a pretty huge dependency (and one that isn't currently compatible with Python 3.13).I've been hoping to find an ultra light-weight chunking library that can do things like very simple regex-based sentence/paragraph/markdown-aware chunking with minimal additional dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also check out https://github.com/D-Star-AI/dsRAG/ for a bit more involved chunking strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you so much for giving Chonkie a chance! Just to note Chonkie is still in beta mode (with v0.1.2 running) with a bunch of things planned for it. It's an initial working version, which seemed promising enough to present.I hope that you will stick with Chonkie for the journey of making the 'perfect' chunking library!Thanks again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100819</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Functionality and Features&gt; The Pi Board is an advanced automated chess system powered by a Raspberry Pi, utilizing an XY stepper motor mechanism and magnets to move chess pieces seamlessly across the board. The development process involved several key stages, including precise calibration of stepper motor coordinates, calculating the weight of each piece for accurate handling, integrating a robust chess engine, and optimizing piece-grabbing strategies and movement detection. Special attention was given to selecting the most efficient algorithm to minimize the stepper motors' power consumption.Is there a reason for the marketing speech? I'm assuming most people interested in this would rather read engineering speech, like so:&gt; The Pi Board, as the name suggests, uses a Raspberry Pi under the hood to calculate engine moves from &lt;Stockfish? Leela Zero?&gt;, and move the pieces with a series of stepper motors and magnets. We spent a significant amount of effort minimizing power consumption, including weighing the individual pieces to get more efficient grabbing and moving motions for each one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hate to be a spoil sport but if when pieces move they nudge other pieces out of the way and then those nudged pieces have to be put back by hand, then there’s still work left to be done. Same goes for capturing - the captured piece should walk itself off the board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories of Regium. A kickstarter scam 5 years ago that used realistic 3d animation videos of an automated chessboard to trick people out of their cash.chess.com happily took regium's money to advertise their scam to their audience.It eventually got kicked off kickstarter, and then kicked off some other kickstarter clones before self hosting their own kickstarter clone website.

GenMC is designed to handle various programming paradigms and provides features such as customizable semantics and efficient analysis methods, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in software verification and systems design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From: https://github.com/MPI-SWS/genmc/blob/master/doc/manual.mdBasic UsageA generic invocation of GenMC resembles the following:genmc [OPTIONS] -- [CFLAGS] &lt;file&gt;...Note that, in order for GenMC to be able to verify it, file needs to meet two requirements: finiteness and data-determinism. Finiteness means that all tests need to have finite traces, i.e., no infinite loops (these need to be bounded; see Section 2.3). Data-determinism means that the code under test should be data-deterministic, i.e., not perform actions like calling rand(), performing actions based on user input or the clock, etc. In other words, all non-determinism should originate either from the scheduler or the underlying (weak) memory model.As long as these requirements as satisfied, GenMC will detect safety errors, races on non-atomic variables, as well as some memory errors (e.g., double-free error). Users can provide safety specifications for their programs by using assert() statements.**I wonder how much this affects usefulness. How often is this the case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098466</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the new features and improvements introduced in F# 9, focusing on language enhancements that increase productivity and usability for developers. Key updates include support for records with updates, improved pattern matching capabilities, and new type annotations that enhance code clarity. Additionally, it discusses benefits like better interoperability with .NET, expanded support for the Discriminated Unions, and features aimed at optimizing performance. Overall, F# 9 aims to streamline workflow and improve the development experience for F# programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;F# has been my favorite language since I first encountered it in uni. 
F# was/is waaaay out ahead of C# with features like unions, null safety, pattern matching, records, more powerful type inference and generic constraints.Over the years C# has been implementing these features too, which is good, but they have been implementing them in incompatible ways, which isn't very good. Since the investment in F# has been much smaller than in C#, it hasn't been innovating as fast as C# and has been left behind in some ways.But it is still a great language and remains broadly compatible with the ecosystem and can deliver equal performance to C# with far less boiler plate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is also a new compile-time error for classes with over 65,520 methods in generated IL. Such classes aren't loadable by the CLR and result in a run-time error. (You won't author that many methods, but there have been cases with generated code.)The mind boggles.At any rate, F# is a terrific language. After excel, probably the second best thing Microsoft has ever released. Turns .NET into a reasonable platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, I made a large, multi-year company/technology bet on top of F# with Phosphor.After over a year of trying to make it work, we completely rewrote the application in Typescript and Rust. The product we're building is an end-user programming tool where the traditional lines between front-end and back-end work blur, and the .NET ecosystem really didn't lend itself well to this.Our hope was that we'd be able to use the Fable library to maintain type safety across a variety of technologies while being able to interop and in and out as needed: Fable compiles F# code to JS, Rust, .NET, etc. The reality was that the interop story between the various libraries we'd use was much harder to achieve than initially expected, and managing and updating multiple dependencies and their bindings was an absolute PITA.The assumption that F# makes for beautiful, efficient code is still a safe one, I think. But the ecosystem and the way that it was designed makes it (in my view) applicable only for applications and software that have very traditional frontend/backend lines. F# would be used for the back-end only in that case.Today, two of the technologies I'm most excited by (and which we're using internally) are the Effect library, whose Schema library fills in a lot of the gaps in TS's type system, and Moonbit, which is what I imagine a modern version of F# would like, free of the MS/.NET dependencies. Moonbit is really, really well designed (designed by the creator of OCAML's version of Fable, ReScript), and it compiles directly to highly optimized JS, WASM or Native output. We're using Effect in production, and not yet Moonbit, but the promise Moonbit holds as a language built for an AI-first world is pretty fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101312</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses typesetting engines, focusing on their role in producing high-quality documents and handling complex layouts. It explores various typesetting tools, including LaTeX, and compares features such as syntax, flexibility, and the ability to manage large documents. The piece emphasizes the importance of choosing the right typesetting engine based on specific needs, such as academic publishing or personal projects, and highlights the ongoing development and community support surrounding these tools. The discussion also touches on trends in typesetting technology and its impact on document creation.&lt;/p&gt;

Widely spoken indo-european languages includes English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and Spanish, etc.&gt; Indo-European languages typically use the Latin alphabetAfter the first sentence, "Indo-European" seems to have transformed to just "European" in the author's mind. Hindi and Bengali, languages more widely spoken than half the language in that list, seem to have been forgotten, along with their Devanagri script.(Over the course of the article, it's seeming like the author just wanted to say European languages, or languages using Latin script, and for some reason chose to use Indo-European instead, despite clearly stating the definition themself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most painful issues I encountered when building out a text layout engine for my JS 2D canvas library were:- Vertical text - in particular when it comes to how CJK punctuation differs in horizontal and vertical environments (not yet solved)- Staying on CJK, making sure the punctuation marks that follow a character don't break and remain with their preceding characters at all times. (I expect the same holds for opening quotes etc but haven't experimented).- Highly ligatured fonts - Devangari, Arabic, etc - there's no solution to styling individual characters within a word that I could find.- Talking of styling ... underlining text is a nightmare - especially if you want to get the little gap between hanging characters and the underline that HTML/CSS browsers do out of the box- Formatting Thai fonts ... is another World of Hurt[1][1] - https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/thai/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written and published over a dozen books. (Two published with big tech publishers, the rest self-published.)With my most recent book, I've moved my PDF generation to Typst.

&lt;p&gt;The Web Locks API provides a mechanism for web applications to request and manage locks for shared resources, ensuring that operations on these resources do not conflict when accessed concurrently. This API allows developers to create exclusive or shared locks to prevent race conditions and inconsistencies in data handling. The documentation covers key concepts, usage patterns, and the methods available for lock acquisition and release, as well as potential use cases and best practices for implementing the API in applications.&lt;/p&gt;

You can use storage APIs in insecure contexts, doing this by spinning, but the lock API which seems much more innocuous requires a secure context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101434</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A piece of advice I've given junior engineers is to write everything twice. Solve the problem. Stash your code onto a branch. Then write all the code again. I discovered this method by accident after the laptop containing a few days of work died. Rewriting the solution only took 25% the time as the initial implementation, and the result was much better.This is true, and I've discovered it myself by losing a branch.However, who the hell has time to write everything twice? There's 1,000 things waiting to be written once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People learn to work better by reflecting on work.  So any framework for self-observation is better than none.I suspect that algorithms as a framework demonstrates the structural aspects (e.g., how some searches are more extensive), but might hide the driving factors. Indeed, the article examples were almost all hacking personality, not technical or process solutions.E.g., most over-engineered solutions are driven by fear, often itself driven by critical or competitive environments.  Conversely, much of the power of senior/staff engineers comes from the license to cut corners afforded their experience.  Or people use the tools they know.You can't get to great by holding onto good.  It's easy to go from bad to good, but takes some courage to toss good to start over for great.  The lesson there is that we stand (hide?) behind our work, and we need to let go of it to improve it.A meta-lesson is that managers need to deeply understand personal space of each developer and the social dynamics of the team before they can do their job effectively, and a key part of that is likely checking in with developers in a way that enhances their courage and self-observation instead of making them fearful and paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review: An anonymous "distinguished CEO and engineer" suggests if you can't complete a feature in a day, delete your progress (except for tests) and start again the next day.The author then recounts advice he gives to juniors, which is to stash the work and rewrite it, claiming that the next day the work will be rewritten in 25% of the time and 2x quality. This is unsubstantiated though. For juniors this suggests it will help them develop their capabilities to reason about implementations of problems without needing to face a a large amount of them.The author then gives another advice which is to ask for a solution to a problem then after the initial proposal, ask for a 24h solution. This is meant to generate "the real solution". He likens it the a path algorithm heuristic to reach your goal quicker.Overall the methods are not well discussed in terms of pros and cons, nor substantiated with experiments.Opinion: I think they may help some juniors who need to build up experience and may become stuck in development patterns. But they would rarely be useful to develop someone to be a senior, if all they do is chase fast implementations. In a way the post gives conflicting advice: write twice and write better, and think twice and think about the fastest way to achieve the goal, instead of engineering a problem.The author hasn't really convinced me of these approaches, and especially the last one smells of eXtreme Go Horse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101729</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A decent, short book on the historical story behind H4 (and the rest of Mr. Harrison’s time-keepers) is “Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time” by Dava Sobel. It goes into the longitude competition, the people involved, and how Harrison was able to (eventually) win with his timekeepers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uni. prof here/shameless plug: I developed a general education class for college students about the 'history of navigation' which includes the science behind navigation and why clocks and (accurate) timekeeping are needed for navigation.  I wrote a book about it all I use for the class, if anyone's interested: https://www.amazon.com/Longitude-Time-Navigation-Tom-Bensky-.... I was inspired by Sobel's book, but I needed more math and science in the discussions.Also, if you can find the book by Williams called "From Sails to Satellites: The Origin and Development of Navigational Science" you'll laugh out loud at his wit about navigation throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also cool from the same site: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/diaphragm-piston-air-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099778</guid></item><item><title>22.

You should never wire up service discovery tools directly to attack tools without a human doing some sanity checking.Anyone legitimately doing offensive security work knows that stupid automated scans are how you take down clients internal networks. Real testing does not involve stealing all the files you can possibly access, it means poking to see what might be useful for further exploitation and only grabbing a small sample for your report (primarily to limit your own liability).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101688</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I learned from running https://www.gnod.com (20 years) and https://www.productchart.com (10 years):Keep your stack flat.Most projects of my web developer friends died after months or a few years. None survived for decades. And the reason was always stack rot.Multiple parts of their stack became outdated and so hard to update that they quit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a problem for any project, and yet another reason to prefer static files for as much as your stack as possible and do not follow the latest tech-stack trends too closely. It is called the bleeding edge because it is covered in the blood of dead projects that cannot be maintained.My advice is to use as few technologies in your stack as possible. Sure, your project might work best with a relational db and a dedicated document store but it might be less ongoing effort to emulate one with the other.And freeze (or at least document) the versions of any dependencies for release. Your project runs fine with CoolTech.1.4 now but in 5 years when you come to rebuild you will find that the interface to CoolTech.6.44 is completely different.And even then things might fail. 20+ years ago I made some Java applets that were well received and useful. Technically they still work (I think) but nobody runs Java in the browser so those projects have been unusable for years. We can be smug about our pure HTML5 static sites now but who knows what the browser landscape will be like in 2050.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally agree with the thesis here.Adjacent points: I also think that selecting mature projects for your dependencies matters significantly. My old couchdb or early node work is generally defunct. On the other hand, I have some dotnet projects that are still functional with zero updates from a decade or more ago.Additionally, it's reasonable to keep a copy of your dependencies somewhere in case the vendor dies, the licensing changes, or something else catastrophic happens. Even if you just image dev's machines when they offboard. There have been a few times this has prevented permanent project death or rewrite emergencies for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101190</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The document provides an overview of the Memory64 proposal for WebAssembly, which aims to extend the addressable memory space from a maximum of 4GB to potentially 16 exabytes. This change is driven by the need for larger memory allocations to support increasingly complex applications. The proposal outlines key ideas, including a new 64-bit memory management model, backward compatibility with existing 32-bit WebAssembly applications, and potential impact on performance. Additionally, it discusses implementation considerations and the ongoing discussions surrounding security and interoperability in relation to this expanded memory model.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious to see what the performance impact of using 64bit memory ends up being. WASM runtimes currently use a clever trick on 64bit host platforms where they allocate a solid 4GB block of virtual memory up front, and then rely on the MMU to catch out-of-bounds accesses by faulting on unmapped pages, so bounds checking is effectively free. That won't work with 64bit WASM though so runtimes will have to do old fashioned explicit bounds checking on every single heap access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there movement on allowing larger memory usage for JS in browsers too? It's pretty limiting in some cases, say if you want to open a large file locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Safari: ?What an understatement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075403</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the process of creating a latency tester, focusing on measuring the time it takes for a signal to travel through a system. It provides insights into the design considerations, equipment needed, and step-by-step instructions for building a custom device. The author explains the importance of accurate latency testing in various applications and offers practical tips for ensuring reliable measurements. Overall, the piece serves as a comprehensive guide for hobbyists and professionals interested in testing and optimizing system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it looks like input latency on current hardware still has not quite caught up with the apple IIe, but is better that the PET 4016, so not all the hardware progress in the last seven yeas has been eaten by software: https://danluu.com/input-lag/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that he openly discusses the paths he went wrong and how more accuracy could be found. Detection threshold from the sensor or avoiding accidental synchronization to the monitor are not obvious pitfalls. 
The mini ASCII histogram is something I need myself - nice thought!I remain puzzled on the goal. 
Does he optimize his setup for a good coding experience? (this should definitely include the actual keyboard in the measurements!) 
Is he optimizing editors? Picking a new monitor? As a learning excercise?I'm all for "because I can" as a valid reason, but that often leaves my projects dangling halfway complete. Are we there yet? Don't know - not sure where I want to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wants to measure this latency without special hardware or code, check if your (friend's) smartphone has a 1000 fps mode. I'm not caught up with newer phones but my 2019 Samsung has this and I use it all the time to look at things that happen quickly.It just needs a lot of light (phone flashlight is sufficient at short range), or to emit light by itself like a screen (or microwave segment display, as a random example where you can see it lights up each digit individually and they're never all on at the same time, but we can't perceive that).Method:To measure, film the computer screen, positioning the phone in a way that it also captures the keyboard (best head on, since you're interested in when vertical movement stops). Press record, strike a key, and go frame by frame on the recording. The moment the key bottoms out is pretty clear by your finger stopping to move down (if the focus is good, you also see a ripple effect in your hand). I know the trigger point will be before the key's very bottom, but the whole key's travel time is on the order of 2-3 frames = ~2-3 ms, which is good enough for me. Then, count frames until the computer screen updates. I usually wait for all channels before considering it updated (my work laptop emits only red on a separate refresh cycle, sometimes noticeable if you look away with some lucky timing in the right way)Similarly for the mouse, though I usually pick it up and hold it in one hand before the screen and click the button in the air so that you can hold it in a good (for the camera) position more easily. By lifting your finger off the mouse button until the moment where you're going to press it, the separation is very well visible on camera and the moment of pressing quite exactly determinableResults:On the LUKS disk password prompt at boot, latency is about 19 ms on a laptop. It feels extremely fast, a little like it shows the asterisk before I've finished pressing the key. After booting the OS, in gnome-terminal I get 48 ms. Connecting an external screen and keyboard via a cheap USB hub, it grows to 62 ms. Finally, inside the virtual machines we're supposed to use for everything (because security), my input-to-photon latency is 134 ms. Guess I can see why that boot prompt feels like a time traveller compared to what I need to use all day long!On a different setup (a family member's iirc, running Windows) with an external monitor that has three gaming modes, called standard, fast, and faster, the latencies are 67, 67, and 62 ms. Pretty disappointing for a "low latency gaming" mode!---Compared to the submission:&gt; One source of latency users experience that my tester doesn’t measure is keyboard latency.The high speed camera method will include this, which is an advantage if you want to know how much latency your setup has, but doesn't help you in picking apart where the latency occurs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044426</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Context from the previous post in the series:&gt; Behavioral Programming is a relatively new programming paradigm that excels at isolating and composing behaviors in event driven system.&gt; Behavioral programming was invented by David Harel[0], who also invented statecharts in 1987. It uses independent units of behavior, called bthreads, which are coordinated in a pub-sub protocol.[0] https://cacm.acm.org/research/behavioral-programming/ (2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like it could be promising for embedded and real time event handling. I dislike async programming.Though it seems possibly similar to ECS systems? Can anyone comment on that aspect?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42060215</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite beefact™ is that each drone carries millions of identical sperm (i.e. male gametes created via mitosis); each queen only takes one maiden voyage, whereupon she typically chooses about a dozen suitors.Her spermathacea is able to keep isolated these dozen suitors' loads, and remembers both the order and the aggressiveness of each suitor (each's "rapiness"). Queen can then choose which sperm bank to use when fertilizing each egg (i.e. creating more female workers)...Through incredible (and largely unknown) mechanisms, queen typically develops sperm/suitor preference. Remembering the rapiness of each suitor, she can adjust hive's temperment (e.g. if skunks are robbing, be more aggressive).As she ages, she'll run out of "The Best Sperm" (remember: it's all stored for YEARS from one mating afternoon) and have to go to B-team, C-team, etc... until the workers choose to replace her (queen mandibular hormone output also greatly reduces as she ages, which gives the hive "identity").One day the Queen's Court will lead her to a queen cup, have her lay a fertilized egg within, ultimately sealing her fate [to be murdered by the princess queen upon her birthing, unless she is still healthy/young enough to be chosen to lead the next outgoing swarm].Source: beekeeper that has read too many books&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case you want to try honeybee experiments at home ... from the paper:https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953"Honeybee handling proceduresThe honeybees were collected from Apis mellifera carnica colonies (western honeybee) at the bee yard of the Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany. Female eggs were collected from naturally mated queens, which were maintained in small nuc colonies with five combs (Holtermann, Germany). To collect female eggs, the queens were caged in Jenter egg-collecting cages (Jenter queen rearing kit, Karl Jenter GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany). For the tracking, we collected newly eclosed bees (0 to 24 hours old) from a brood comb that was maintained in an incubator at 34°C. The laboratory rearing of worker bees was done as previously reported (19). We grafted the newly hatched larvae into plastic cups (#4963, Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) with worker diet # 7 (53% royal jelly, 4% glucose, 8% fructose, 1% yeast extract, and 34% autoclaved water) (74). To obtain bees with fully developed worker characteristics, we experimentally determined the amount of food provided, which was 170 μl per larvae. The larvae were kept at 34°C and 90% relative humidity. The latter was generated using saturated solution of K2SO4 (75). Before defecation, the larvae were transferred onto Kimwipe papers (Delicate Task Wipers, #066664, Kimberly Clark) and were kept in petri dishes for 2 days at 70% relative humidity, which we generated using saturated NaCl2 solutions (75). After defecation, the prepupae were separated into plates with 24 wells (#92424, Peter Oehmen GmBH, Essen, Germany) in which filter papers were placed (15 mm, grade 413; VWR, International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Once they started walking, they were marked and maintained in small cages together with eclosed wt workers coming from colonies (#20104; Imkereifachhandel Jasniak, Trossin, Germany) in which water and sugar paste supplemented with pollen (#7032; Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) was provided. To obtain myrGFP-mutated worker or queen bees, we reared the queens as described (17, 76). To obtain myrGFP worker bees, 12- to 19-day-old myrGFP queens were inseminated with wt drones using standard insemination techniques. The queens were treated with CO2 1 day before insemination. Inseminated queens were maintained in small nucs (“Kieler Begattungskasten,” Holtermann, Germany) with wt worker bees. The nucs were kept in a containment so that mutated animals were not able to escape into nature. To obtain newly eclosed dsxmyrGFP/+ worker bees, combs with capped cells were maintained in an incubator at 34°C."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting insight led to their research (from the paper):
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953(First, some interesting background:)"The evolutionary transition from solitary to social living in vertebrates and invertebrates led to sophisticated social behaviors. During the past 50 to 150 million years of evolution, sociality in some species became so elaborate that individuals in the group forego reproduction and changed their behavioral performance to embrace collective behavior, while others specialize in reproduction leading to the development of two castes, queen and workers (1, 2). From behavioral activities of hundreds and sometimes ten-thousands of worker individuals, new properties have emerged at the collective level such as shared brood care, warfare, collective thermoregulation, nest building, and farming, which contributed to the spectacular ecological success of the eusocial species (2). The collective tasks and functions cannot be performed by any single individual alone. They require a group and inherited behavioral patterns performed by individual workers."(And later ... [I added the paragraph breaks])"In advanced eusocial insect colonies, sophisticated innate behaviors establishing sociality are limited to the worker caste, not to queens. This led to our hypothesis that a dedicated developmental program for social behaviors will be found in the pathway determining the differentiation into the worker castes. ...Dsx proteins are part of the structurally and functionally conserved doublesex and mab-3–related transcription factor family (Dmrt) and are critical for sex-specific differentiation throughout the animal kingdom (39, 40) and sexual behaviors in insects (9, 41). DsxF is required for the worker-characteristic differentiation of the worker ovary, suggesting that DsxF is a component of the worker caste developmental program (19).The worker bees do not perform sexual behaviors. However, we found that dsx is also expressed in the worker’s brain (42) suggesting that the gene may have another role unrelated to sexual reproduction but related to promoting social living behaviors in the worker caste."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055134</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This comment is not legal advice.  This comment is merely for educational purposes.The quote that you have about the 1997 patent, namely "U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,925 teaches a process for adjusting the deposition rate..." is from the specification.  That is written by either the inventors or more likely the attorneys filing the application.  The specification is not legally enforceable or binding.  It is supposed to disclose enough information to let somebody reproduce the claimed invention.  As a matter of practice, the specification can say almost anything it wants, including non-enforceable things.Only the claims are legally enforceable.  I suggest taking a closer look at the claims and seeing if these are problematic for your application or not.  You may want to consult an attorney if you have further questions.You can look up the patent examiner's reasoning for allowing the application here:https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17667081Click on "Documents and Transactions" and look for "Notice of Allowance and Fees Due".  Also look for the "Non-Final Rejection" for additional information from the examiner from an earlier version of the application.I should note that it does not appear that the patent examiner considered the 1997 patent directly relevant because they did not cite it in any of the office actions or specifically the PTO-892 forms (search the documents page for 892 to see what I'm talking about).  However, they likely did at least look at it since it is listed in the specification.Again, if you have further questions, you really should consult an attorney.  This is not a good forum for this kind of discussion, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant video on the subject, discussing brick layers, and the patents:https://youtu.be/9IdNA_hWiyE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real problem is that patent system seems ripe for abuse.  Even if the "invention" is not a valid patent, companies want to patent it anyway, as to force the other side to expend resources to prove it's not valid.There's a couple Bambu Lab patents that probably should not have been granted with prior art in open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102235</guid></item><item><title>32.

Their headline finding is that they created a map between resting state and "watching a movie".This is, for better or worse, the kind of research you can only do at institutions which have free fMRI scanning (MIT, Princeton, Harvard, etc.). No behavioural links, only very detailed activation maps that we can't really draw conclusions from.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how DNA analysis of victims from the Pompeii eruption has uncovered unexpected familial and social relationships among the deceased, highlighting the complexity of their connections. While the disaster was catastrophic, the genetic data has provided insights into the individuals' origins and ties, revealing that many of the victims were not just random inhabitants but were likely linked through shared ancestry or familial bonds. This research expands our understanding of the population dynamics of Pompeii and the human stories behind the tragic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website offers an interactive time-travel experience using Google Street View, allowing users to explore historical images of various locations around the world. By selecting different dates, users can see how specific places have changed over time, providing a visual journey through history. This feature highlights significant changes in urban landscapes, architecture, and environments while engaging users in a unique way to learn about the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075855"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks less like a street view, and more like 360 images that link to one another. For example with future LA, I could only jump once forward and then back and the images didn't have any continuity between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the title should be "AI time-travel street-view" if it's going to have hyphens anywhere,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool but the interface could use some tweaks to be useable, or at least more consistent with actual Google Street view.  - transitions do not animate between camera positions
  - positions are spaced so far apart that it's not clear how they are connected.  Google Street View normally has many positions close together, so you always have a sense of where you are relative to your last position.
  - acceleration for spinning the viewpoint is too high, I kept overshooting my target and having to go back and forth, dropping down to a slower speed for accuracy.
  - the icons disappear when you click, which no explanation to get them back.  I didn't even realize they were off at first and just thought there weren't many icons
  - the "info" icon enlarges on hover, suggesting it's interactive if you click on it, but nothing happens
  - arrows on the ground would be nice

Some of these are a bit nit-picky, but if you're going to call it "Street View", then you set certain expectations.  If you're going for a different experience, it should be called something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075855</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came into a company once that had built their own server room.  It had a couple hundred pizza boxes in it and was always hot as hell even with full blast air conditioning.  When I retired almost all of them to use virtual servers, it turns out that 1) a lot of the chipsets internallyl still had plastic film on them (to prevent scratches? Why would you put film on them? There were even some CPUs that didn't have any coolers on them, just film) and 2) A lot of the inpflow and outflow air ports also had plastic shipping film that was never removed.  I was completely shocked.  So I fixed dozens if not a hundred computers simply by removing a piece of tape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My 1070 is currently running with tape covering half of the PCIe pins so it works on x8 instead of x16.One day it stopped working. During troubleshooting it would work only on a 10 year old PC I had lying around. The difference? Despite being full-size, the GPU slot on the old mobo was wired only for x8.I reckon that the GPU die lost connection on some pins. Not worth fixing, x8 works fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently on a mission to tape a bunch of gear too. Though to cover LEDs. Why does consumer gear meant for houses look like a disco at night?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103000</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses implementing pushed authorization requests (PAR) in ASP.NET Core 9, focusing on how this approach enhances security during the authorization process by allowing clients to send a request for authorization in advance without requiring user interaction. It outlines the necessary steps for configuring PAR in an ASP.NET application, including setting up the required services, defining endpoints, and handling authorization logic. The piece also highlights the benefits of using PAR, such as improved user experience and reduced risk of authorization code interception, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to implement more secure OAuth 2.0 flows in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to effectively handle the salary expectations question during job interviews. It emphasizes the importance of researching industry standards and understanding your worth before the interview. The author suggests strategies for responding, such as deflecting the question initially or providing a salary range based on market data. Additionally, the piece highlights the significance of confidence and preparation in negotiating salary to achieve favorable outcomes in job offers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always recommend this article: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
I think this topic is super important and I’m really glad I didn’t follow advice of saying your “expected salary or expected +20%”. Here my anecdotal SWE salary history:Worked at a startup for a bunch of years making 90k by the endGot offered a place at FAANG. Recruiter pushed me a little bit on expected salary but I didn’t give one using all the approached from the linked article. They offered me 250k. I would have never ever assumed that I can be payed this much. 
Instead of accepting I again followed the advice and asked for time to think. I had no counter offers but spoke to the recruiter thanked them for the offer and asked if there’s room for improvement. And they were nice and reasonable, they said yes if there are counter offers or you are leaving unvested stock behind. I was leaving unvested stock in an unprofitable startup, but I wrote the amount and vesting schedule and got offer bumped by 25k.After working there I considered going to trading shop. Used the same approach and they offered 400k. Again this number seemed insane at the time. So I asked for more, this time I had much lower counter offer. But I could use it as some form of leverage. They upped the offer by 150k by the end (this is sign on+ salary+guaranteed first year bonus).I am writing this not to show off the numbers, but to show other engineers that your idea of how much you should be payed could be completely wrong. Let the employer give information first and don’t back yourself into the corner by revealing your ignorance of market or minimum comp you are willing to take.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've talked to several recruiters and HR people who were prepared for quite a different answer than I gave to this question.I got the feeling that several interviews were carried out afterwards out of politeness or because the recruiter "had to" do it, but the interview ended before it began. Than, there's either ghosting or almost immediate (like up to an hour past the interview) copy-paste email along the lines of "we decided to go with another candidate".A few recruiters however were open that they've checked the salary for similar position in my country's capital city (Warsaw) and it's much lower than what I'm asking. Pointing out 20+ years of experience and listing accomplishments seems less important for a lot of businesses, than paying as little as possible.I got a few links to these "check salary for [level] [position] in [city]" websites from recruiters. All these seem to be crafted in a way that undervalues employees by artificially lowering country-wide salaries to ridiculous levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless you end up with someone like me who has a budget and always pays the max.I usually ask "what do you expect to be paid" to understand if I'll make them happy or sad when discussing what I'll actually offer.This is not foolproof and has caused some issues with people coming in as very good negotiators and thinking my inability to budge is because I'm being hard-line, when in reality it's because- as mentioned, I always offered the max for a role.The second issue is that not all people are equivalently valuable, but I think solving that in the salary is terrible, because salary should cover your compensation for responsibility. If you have to reward someone valuable then it should probably be via bonus' imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101107</guid></item><item><title>42.

Their small size also offers unique capabilities for the screening of shipping containers, such as being able to navigate densely packed areas or be lifted to assess contents of sealed containers by screening ventilation systems. Future directions include assessing operational feasibility of deploying rats at ports.A fascinating read.  A team of  2 rats were able to get a 100% detection rate with very few false positives. Would be a transformative change for import customs if it translates to real-world settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026468</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses updates to the Rust programming language's trademark policy, which aims to clarify the use of the Rust logo, name, and branding by individuals and organizations. The updates emphasize a more flexible approach to using the trademark in community projects while maintaining the integrity of the Rust brand. It also outlines the process for obtaining permission to use the trademarks, ensuring that Rust remains a recognizable and trusted technology while fostering community involvement and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part of the policy about distributing modified versions of the Rust compiler seems interesting:&gt; Publicly distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language, compiler,
or the Cargo package manager, provided that the modifications are limited to:&gt; - code adjustments for the purpose of porting to a different platform, architecture,
or system, or integrating the software with the packaging system of that platformIt looks like distributing a modified version with any change that isn't related to compatibility with a different platform/architecture/system is not allowed. This would probably make almost all GitHub forks of Rust non-compliant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This subject is a touchy one because it usually attracts a lot of people who are upset because they think they’ve lost something they had. A lot of those comments start with “I’m not a lawyer but …”Then all of these upset people writing angry comments creates an impression of drama. Then reaction streamers on YouTube read these comments out and get their viewers riled up over a non issue. That’s when the real drama starts.I’d urge people to remember that this policy is very similar to the Python Foundation. If Rust is doomed to be only as successful as Python that’s not a terrible outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The crates prefixes "rust-" and "cargo-" are no longer reserved to the Rust Project.Gosh they really should have used namespaces, huh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101536</guid></item><item><title>44.

It highlights the capabilities of these models to perform complex tasks, engage in coherent dialogues, and generate contextually relevant responses.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who followed Deep Learning in the 2010s would have guessed the same thing. Big boom with vision models by adding a lot of layers and data, but eventually there was diminishing returns there too. It’s unsurprising the same would happen with LLMs. I don’t know why people keep expecting anything other than a sigmoid curve. Perhaps they think it’s like Moore’s law but that’s simply not the case in this field.But that’s fine, LLMs as-is are amazing without being AGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- There _was_ a problem with diminishing returns from increasing data size. Then they surpassed that by curating data.- Then the limits on the amount of curatable data available made the performance gains level off. So they started generating data and that pushed the nose up again.- Eventually, even with generated data, gains flattened out. So they started increasing inference time. They have now proven that this improves the performance quite a bit.It's always been a series of S-curves and we have always (sooner or later) innovated to the next level.Marcus has always been a mouth just trying to take down neural networks.Someday we will move on from LLMs, large multimodal models, transformers, maybe even neural networks, in order to add new levels and types of intelligence.But Marcus's mouth will never stop yapping about how it won't work.I think we are now at the point where we can literally build a digital twin video avatar to handily win a debate with Marcus, and he will continue to deny that any of it really works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The context some commenters here seem to be missing is that Marcus is arguing that spending another $100B on pure scaling (more params, more data, more compute) is unlikely to repeat the qualitatively massive improvement we saw between say 2017 and 2022. We see some evidence this is true in the shift towards what I categorize as system integration approaches: RAG, step by step reasoning, function calling, "agents", etc. The theory and engineering is getting steadily better as evidenced by the rapidly improving capability of models down in the 1-10B param range but we don't see the same radical improvements out of ChatGPT etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097774</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember setting geofenced reminders maybe even 10 years ago ("remind me X when I'm near the supermarket") and they were pretty cool but sat squarely in that zone where they were useful enough to be interesting but not reliable enough that you could count on them (the number of times I got a reminder 5 minutes after I left a place was a lot) - so the applications where you could seriously use them sat in a very narrow band.This is probably one of a litany of missed opportunities I see where specifically Google missed the boat around 2010 - 2015. So much of what we have today they were already rolling out on phones as smart features ("Google Now" etc), and somehow it all faltered or even went backwards (I could reliably in set reminders by voice in 2013 I think, but by 2018 they were so unreliable I gave up).What I don't understand here is how they are going to do all this tracking and ambient AI without destroying your phone battery. I'm surprised Apple especially will even allow a background process to run that is doing that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gross.&gt; “The new company is building a service that leverages the enormous corpus of data in large AI systems and  newly ubiquitous headphones.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s funny, I feel quite the opposite. Using windows is a form of asceticism, and Linux is the easy way. Everything just works under Linux, but under Windows, things go wrong for no apparent reason, the system installs updates and reboots without me telling it to, there is massive network traffic that I didn’t initiate, none of my tools work properly, there are ads on the start menu, and software I know I installed is nowhere to be found. Talk about mortification of the flesh! Nothing humbles you like being subject to Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get it, for me a computer is a tool. I want to get away from it as fast as possible, having to tweak the environment is a waste of time .That's why I like macos so much, nothing is perfect but I know that whatever I do there are tools somewhat easy to use .For instance I wanted to read an epub on my computer that runs windows, believe it or not but finding a good or even descent epub reader is a nightmare. Wasted a lot of time before settling on FB reader.On mac, you just have the book app. It's not perfect, when you export highlights for instance it always add 'copyright blabla' but it's good enough for my casual reading.Same for pdf, you want an app that can read pdf and do some basic stuff like reorganize pages or compress them. On Mac there is preview, on windows ? Edge can just read and it's a browser, adobe is paid software and install a lot of junk.And you repeat that for basically everything it's such a waste of time.Linux is even worst than windows on that matter.If you are looking for that kind of 'experience' like the author, i suggest hitting yourself on the balls with a hammer. That would be quicker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was unsurprised to find Arch and NixOS mentioned, they're more or less for asceticism, and they usually show up on the ascetic's path. But having learned the power of going without from Linux, there's a lot of similar places to go besides an increasing difficult progression of Linux distributions.Repeatable Builds is something that can be practiced without Linux, but which the Linux ascetic will find pleasingly austere. Working with immutable data send like another. And then there's all the ways one can avoid using a pointing device, or not buying things your can't hack...It's a path that Linux can teach you to to walk, but it's not Linux's path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099398</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various text file formats, specifically focusing on ASCII delimited text as a more suitable alternative to traditional CSV or tab-delimited formats. It highlights the limitations of these common formats, such as issues with encoding and special characters, and advocates for the use of ASCII, which provides better control over data representation. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing the right format for data integrity and accessibility, and provides insights on how to implement ASCII delimited text effectively in data handling practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with no restrictions on the text in fields or the need to try and escape characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but wouldn't it still need escaping for those ASCII separator characters (or alternatively, a restriction for the stored text not to have them)?It's true that having to deal with escaping much less often (since the ASCII separator characters are rarer than commas/quotes) would be convenient for manual reading/writing, but I feel that's canceled out by the characters being hard to type/see (likely the reason why they're rare) - and it wouldn't necessarily save on writer/parser code complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this format best of all, CSV is # 2 favorite.At work we settled on using ^G (0x07) as a delimiter instead of TABs for file transfers and loading data into various databases.The reason was Excel.  People/systems who create these files sometimes source from Excel.  And Excel can have a habit of placing odd characters in text fields.  We found the one character never encountered was BEL.For text fields we tend to remove embedded white space and after replacing TABs with 1 space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the early 2000s, back at the beginning of the world, Yahoo's web code used ^A and ^B for field and record separators to avoid having to escape commas and quotes and newlines. That was probably the last time I ever saw ASCII control characters used as intended in the wild.There is no technical reason why CSV should have won out, except that keyboards have a comma key and almost never a ^A key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100499</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel your pain. I have been making things like this in Go;https://github.com/tluyben/go-proxyhttps://github.com/tluyben/redis-sentinel-proxyjust to make them easier to instrument for my experiments. The first one I made because after trying all tutorials on haproxy/nginx to make proxying work without the target domain being resolvable (so no dns entry until it's up), I got annoyed (nothing worked while everything only and gpt said it should work) and just did it like this. Also it makes it very easy to throw in my own, complex as I want rules and logging and telemetry (to whatever I want) at any level.The second I needed to test an existing, not able to change (they have an old version running they cannot update at the moment, don't ask) software against a redis sentinel setup.The main thing is that I am more and going towards having the program language as config instead of greenspun's tenth rule where everyone builds some annoying and limited 'almost (usually esoteric) programming language' as config language over time. I want that hard lifting to be done in my native language (Lisp, Go, Rust) and have the config be for ip addresses and ports only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would expect my web application framework to handle all of these tasks, except perhaps header filtering. If it didn’t I’d rather fix that problem in the web application itself instead of adding a complicating layer of infrastructure that I now need to include in integration tests and release process.I see some merit to moving the size limits etc out of the application to reduce CPU waste there on overly large requests, but either way I’m still burning some CPUs on it.Is the use-case for this mostly about sticking some validation in front of a system who’s code you can’t or don’t want to modify for some reason, like in front of Wordpress?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Won't the fact that it's written in Python make it too slow for high traffic sites or APIs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097735</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Lambda 0, a concept in functional programming where a function can be treated as a first-class citizen without any context or parameters. It explores how this concept relates to the notion of pure functions and the implications for programming languages and paradigms. The author provides examples and explanations of how Lambda 0 can enhance code simplicity, maintainability, and readability, making a case for its utility in modern software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice way to think about eta-reduction is that it asserts something about the types of expressions in lambda calculus, namely that every expression is in fact a function.If an expression M can appear in the left position of the function application operation, this implies that M is a function.By way of analogy, if I have a formula x == x+0, this implies that x is a number.Or, s == s + '' would imply that s is a string.So, if M == lambda x. M(x), this is saying that M is a function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What follows the lambda is the list of arguments.It would be clearer to say that what follows the lambda is the name of its (single) argument, not a list. And then explain that for notational convenience, you could abbreviate successive abstractions. Btw, if you really base it on lists, then do you allow an empty list as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100107</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed guide on how to send an Ethernet packet using Python and sockets. It explains the necessary libraries, such as Scapy, and outlines the process of constructing and sending packets over a network. Key topics include the creation of raw sockets, setting the required socket options, and manipulating packet data to ensure proper transmission. The guide serves as a practical resource for developers looking to understand low-level network programming and packet manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But if I had any kind of point, it would probably be that spending the time to do things like write tools and explore the debugging space is pretty much always worth it.&gt; Strangely, I've found that there is a not-insignificant number of people are against this - especially in a professional environment. I think this has something to do with the JIRA-fication of development process, where all work is divided and sub-divided, and anything that does not directly check a box and produce a deliverable is wasted effort. It's disheartening that there is a whole group of people - developers and managers alike - who do not understand or see the value in exploration as part of the process.So true, being able to create your own small tools is a superpower which is often at the heart of 10x programmers. It is sadly an art often practiced in the shadow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the title is rather vague, this is the start of a series about building a TCP/IP and Ethernet framing stack from scratch for a microcontroller. The author uses a chip (W5100) which can handle TCP/IP itself, but also supports handing it pre-built Ethernet frames, although the chip handles the preamble and CRC calculation. Most of the article is about trying to communicate with the chip itself, and sending a test packet (which I'm guessing is hardcoded, although it's not called out in the article).(I was hoping it would be about bit-banging Ethernet on some improbable bit of hardware.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a strange career jump recently into FPGA engineering with a focus on Ethernet. It's been a fun journey, which culminated in me finally designing my own Hard MAC IP and sending a packet over some custom PHY IP. I'd highly recommend it for those looking to try a "Hard Mode" version of this challenge. I feel like networking is very abstracted from users, so understanding how Ethernet cards, modems and switches put together and pull apart sections of packets, and how the PHY/PCS recovers signals over a link was really valuable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105190</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of reverse-engineering APIs, focusing on techniques and tools used to analyze and understand how APIs work. It highlights the importance of inspecting network traffic and the role of tools like Postman and Fiddler in exploring API endpoints. The author emphasizes ethical considerations and the legal implications of reverse-engineering, suggesting that developers should use these skills for legitimate purposes, such as enhancing interoperability and improving software. Overall, the guide serves as a resource for developers looking to deepen their understanding of API interactions and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a former job, we reverse engineered the trading APIs of most American retail stock brokerages (Fidelity, E-Trade, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, etc). We did it by rooting an iPhone and using Charles Proxy to grab the unencrypted traffic.I learned a lot from that experience, and it's also just plain fun to do. We did get some strongly worded letters from Robinhood though, lol. They tried blocking our servers but we just set up this automated system in Digital Ocean that would spin up a new droplet each time we detected a blockage, and they were never able to stop us after that.Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is how I made a better version of the nhl.com site [1] that has a better UI (you can see scores/schedules much more easily), is mobile first, has no ads, and responsiveness built in.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the hypothesis postulates that previously a species different from ours had achieved high intelligence and technological civilization on this planetAn interesting special version of this hypothesis is that if a species has achieved truly high intelligence and advanced technology, it may by design not have left any traces. Not because of modesty but because long-term sustainable existence actually required being light on environmental impact.Changing your environment at planetary scale and breakneck speed is not necessarily the pinnacle of intelligence, certainly not if you have manifestly not yet understood all its intricacies, interdependence etc. A lack of understanding coupled with aggressive random interventions may even affect the very survival of a species.The downside of the deep-sea tree-huger cephalopod scenario is that it is even harder to falsify...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised the article didn't mention the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) [0] and it's interesting relation to "a species different from ours had achieved high intelligence and technological civilization on this planet."For those unaware, the PETM was a rapid increasing in global temperature (and CO2 concentrations) around between 60-50 million years ago. This lead to a minor (on a geological time scale, major for those creatures living through it) climate crisis.The cause for the rapid increase in temperatures at this time is still the subject of deep debate and largely unknown. However how very "out there" hypothesis, not even mentioned on the wikipedia page, is that this could have been when a civilization such as our experience an event more-or-less identical to our own current climate crisis caused by the rapid use of hydro-carbons.Of course, the biggest challenge with this hypothesis is, as pointed out in the article, a civilization like this would not leave a trace on the geological record. So there's really no reasonable way to have much evidence in favor of this possible explanation.But since here about this I've been fascinated by the problem of sending messages to the future. Suppose we come to realize that rapid use of hydrocarbons does most certainly lead to the destruction of any civilization foolish enough to tread this path. The most reasonable focus of scientific effort that would be to figure a way to warn the next advanced civilization on this planet in hopes they might not meet the same fate. But presuming that civilization is 50 million years in the future, how could this be done?0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Therm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The proposition that this was the case, is what I consider the actual most interesting hypothesis most likely to be false&gt;Probably the esteemed reader has noticed by now that I am no true believer in the Silurian hypothesis, but I like to entertain itThis kind of speculation has always stimulated my imagination. Unfortunately, the era of "fact-check" and truthiness has spawned a class of professional debunkers. This creates space for opportunist trolls to take the contrarian position. At one point there were those who engaged in debates over flat-earth for the sake of honing rhetorical skills. Today adults crusade against these absurdities without the slightest inkling of self-irony. Flat-earth is typically used as a pejorative at HN.We haven't entirely lost the ability to have stimulating conversations about Silurians, Atlanteans or other improbable fantasy scenarios, but the trend is approaching. It feels like an indictment of the pop-materialist world view, mass media control structures or just our current era of Internet. Perhaps other posters can point to the underlying causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106700</guid></item><item><title>5.

It’s a colossal exercise in ego.”This is my thought about all these efforts. The mammoth people talk like it's about a solution to climate change, but that's obviously working backwards from their goal (revive the mammoth for reasons) to some sort of reasonable-sounding justification. They set out with different motivations in mind.I'd ask the same question here: why try to bring back a species we already killed off? These won't be descendants of the animals we killed, so it's hardly a form of reparations. If it's about preserving the ecosystems we already have, there have to be more efficient ways to do that than rebreeding less stripe zebras.It's hard not to see this as just the same impulse that led to the poodle: because we can and because it will look cool and draw attention and make money. The only difference is there's a slight nostalgic bent to the aesthetic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question of 'Why bring back extinct species?' is fundamentally the same as 'Why save species from extinction?'. It's unspoken but seems to be widely understood that biodiversity and preventing its permanent loss has inherent value. It sometimes has economic or ecological value too, or the potential in the future, but even when that's not the case most would agree we should aim to minimize extinction of other animals - if for no other reason than it being easier to drive a species to extinction than revive any of the billions of extinct species out there. (at least for now)It's curious that the response to bringing back mammoths and less-stripey-zebras is so lukewarm when there's very little of the same criticism directed at efforts to save obscure species that are in decline. Say it was discovered that a small herd of quagga had survived since we thought they died out in 1883, but without human intervention they will soon due to habitat loss. Imagine: "Why would we want to save them? The world is inhospitable to them now, their population declined for a reason. They have no use to us, and their niche isn't one that couldn't be filled by living species that we could import. To keep them from going extinct would be a cruel and irrational act of ego."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107534</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've got patches under review: https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/cover.1722193092.git... (triggered by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-42410, a graphics stack stability issue that wasn't as visible in RHEL 9 for some reason)At least the first one (the getenv thread safety fix) will hopefully make it into glibc 2.41 and it should be quite safe to backport.  It turns out that setenv is easier to handle because glibc already never frees environment strings.  It's concurrent unsetenv that is rather tricky.  Without some snapshot approach, getenv would return null pointers instead of environment variables values that are actually set.  I don't want to introduce locking into getenv because getenv without setenv has been async-signal-safe for so long that it would likely break applications.The environ handling fixes are a bit more controversial because vfork+execve make it complicated to avoid memory leaks, but these further fixes are less important to the stability of the graphics stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you! I deeply appreciate that Steam works so well on Linux these days. I don't take for granted the hard work happening behind the scenes to make that a reality for us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn’t best practice to read all environment variables on boot and never use setenv? The only place where setenv would matter is for spawning new processes where you should probably be creating an new environ cloned from the current one and update the new values. Using getenv/setenv as an IPC messaging mechanism seems to be an opportunity for lots of issues aside from it historically not being multithreaded-safe on Linux and having all sorts of potential memory leaks hiding (which is what the post ignores when it says that it’s thread safe on MacOS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110677</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think that this algorithm can handle slash chords like G/C (G over C) and would instead label it as Gsus4. The former gives a lot of important context to voicing which can by important if you need a particular sort of motion in the bass line.My hunch is that any algorithm  that analyzes chords in isolation (and not in the context of other chords in the song) is going to miss out on overall readability. Good chord notation has a sort of elegance that can highlight the similarities/differences between sequential chords that can make things very intuitive for the musician&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It is also important to know that chords are built on thirds."Except for the ones built on seconds ("cluster chords"), fourths ("quartal chords"), fifths ("quintal chords"), the chords that make jazz work, and for obsessive/completists, polychords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a programmer and a classically trained pianist, this section:&gt; For example, the notes C, E and G (The C major chord) can have any of the following names, based on what is considered to be the root note.&gt; root note chord name&gt; C C Major&gt; E E Minor #5&gt; G G sus4 (13)&gt; (To the best of my knowledge, I'm no music theorist)is disqualifying for any usefulness in this program-- it will lead to more misguidance than clarity. without theory, there is no reason.i would analyze these inversion chords in the frame of the key of C major: CM, C6, and C64 based on Figured Base Notation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)#Figured_bass&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106548</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. Thanks for reading this post. I had fun making this and thought the path that led me to this might be interesting for others.I’m really interested in feedback and ideas on things I could improve and add. I found this really inspiring as it got me more into programming, discovering electronics, and 3d printing.I have no desire to ever make this project commercial, but it’s been a great platform for me to learn and experiment new things so I’ll take any idea be it for the gameplay or purely technical. Some features I have in mind are:- Multiplayer over bluetooth where one device is the ‘game-master’ running the exchange and can monitor and guide players while injecting events.- Additional quoting algos such as pegging one side of the order book and fighting for position- A tutorial and better UI. The game is hard to pick up for the first time and probably needs to be made more intuitive etc.While all of this was made with no practical use in mind (there are a lot of markets and products, and you’d trade them in different ways, so you’d need a different game to speak to a volatility trader for example), some people I work with at various trading desks found it useful for interviews or as an introduction to the idea of market-making for junior people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting project! The kid is only mentioned at the beginning, I wonder if they participated further in the project, or if they enjoyed playing the game?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm. Very cool project…But the last thing I want for my kid is for them to learn that active trading is fun, lest they try doing it with real money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108907</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked at Fairchild Sentry DTS in San Jose (at that time very close to the airport) circa 1984-1986 on the series 50 ATE. It was a beast. At the time it could clock &amp; test up to 50MHz (hence the '50'). It was pretty much all ECL which would get very hot. Each unit shipped with a DEC VAX - that was my intro to VMS which had some interesting features like file versioning. I worked as a tech on the production floor building the 50. It was just being introduced and there were so many problems with getting them up and running. The systems had to be calibrated and that was done by changing the lengths of hundreds of delay wires on the backplane (in addition to digital delay-lines in the test head that could be automatically calibrated (over several hours) with the delay values being stored on disk). No two systems were exactly the same because of this (I'm sure this was also an issue with earlier ATE models as well). IIRC the 50 was "introduced" (announced) in '84 shortly before the time I started. I recall that we were way behind in producing them and there was lots of blame flying between production (us) and engineering - as in maybe they designed something that wasn't easily reproducible.In my next job I moved into an engineering role and I always kept that experience as a technician in the back of my mind: make sure what you're designing can be built with reproducible results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We had to be careful about those AC utility jacks. The tester ground was at -11 volts at several hundred amps. If you clipped a scope to a ground, it would happily melt the insulation off the scope probe until it stunk up the room and pooled on the floor. We had to use a three-prong adapter with the ground cut off.You don't get this kind of excitement anymore with modern electronics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typo?  "ZIP DIP socket" should be "ZIF DIP socket", as in Zero Insertion Force?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110081</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the infamous theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911, which significantly increased the painting's fame. The perpetrator, an Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia, believed that the artwork should be returned to Italy. His elaborate heist involved hiding the painting in his apartment for over two years before he attempted to sell it to an art dealer in Florence, leading to his arrest. This high-profile crime captured public attention, transforming the Mona Lisa into a global icon. The article also delves into the painting's history, its artistic significance, and how the theft altered its perception in the art world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always loved this quote: "What audacious criminal, what mystifier, what maniac collector, what insane lover, has committed this abduction?"Though Peruggia claims he did it out of patriotism, I've always nursed the theory that, during its absence, the original was used as reference to create several extremely good fake versions. These could be sold as the original, since everyone knew it had been stolen, and each would think they had the real one. Then the original is returned, and the buyers are without recourse. What are you going to do, tell the police? And of course Peruggia et al would say nothing.I suspect this isn't true, but the fun part is that it could be and no one would ever know. So I'm choosing to believe it is so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Peruggia, meanwhile, was charged with theft and put on trial in Italy. During his testimony, he claimed that national pride had inspired him to steal the painting, which he believed had been looted from his native Italy during the Napoleonic era. Peruggia was mistaken—Da Vinci had brought the Mona Lisa to France in 1516, and King Francois I had later purchased it legally—but the patriotic defense won him legions of admirers. Even after the prosecution presented evidence that he planned to shop the painting around to art dealers and sell it for profit, many Italians still considered him a national hero.Just the sort of nationalism that would lead Europe (and other nations) into the Great War only a few years later. The guy only served seven months. Nationalism begets poor outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK, this is a horrific tangent, but if you haven't seen the classic Doctor Who story "City of Death", go check it out.Written by Douglas Adams and filmed on-location in Paris, it involves the Mona Lisa being stolen, and is probably the finest Doctor Who story ever written.In fact it's so good that I'm always a little disappointed by other classic stories in comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42048162</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty sensationalist title for used furniture arbitrage.I was hoping for some insight on capture and disposition of IP.I would think failing gracefully involves reaching out to competitors (and customers and suppliers) for "mergers" so investors get some of the value of the company -- without somehow signaling that you're giving up (and can no longer be relied upon).  What's the state of the art in that respect?  It seems like a fantastically tricky process, which would mean high value for skilled practitioners.(OTW (ahem) valuable employee stock goes to zero.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2001 (or 02?) I remember visiting a clearance warehouse like this in Ottawa during the post-dot-com-boom crash and it was where all the west-end startups and network tech companies had dumped their furniture after either going completely out of business or emergency-downsizing.It was wild, I have a picture somewhere of a high-school-gym-sized room just filled corner-to-corner with plastic-wrapped Aeron chairs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regularly attended the liquidations in Sunnyvale around 2002-2005 after I was laid off from my dot com but the only thing I could make any profit on was docking stations and the associated power adapters since at that time they were specific to each laptop model. I would think the overhead storing furniture is significant. A couple of times I got lucky such as when Casady and Greene closed down and I got a bunch of copies of Conflict Catcher 9 that was still in demand and when Apple closed down a TV studio in Cupertino and I bought the contents of the back storage room that had a bunch of valuable bits and pieces. Unfortunately reality TV was still in its infancy or I would have been a minor star:-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107870</guid></item><item><title>13.

Tuberculosis is fully solved in advanced countries yet less developed countries still suffer from it. Pakistan has 260 death per 100k capita, the US has 2.6. The highest 5 countries have at least 600 per 100k capita.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh hey, I had TB. It sucked. I had to be proper quarantined for 3 months, felt like shit for a whole year and a half, and nearly died because I didn't realize I had any symptoms. I thought I was just tired and depressed all the time because I hated my job, and then one day I collapsed from what I thought was a heart attack.I was/am otherwise healthy and must have just drawn the short straw (or it was a very long dwelling infection from a trip abroad years earlier). I really wish we vaccinated for it like Europe. I'd have taken the little scar on my arm for reducing the already small chance of dealing with that shit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I almost lost a former partner to this disease. Totally changed my life.One of my first projects at my development consulting job was a site build for an org working on vaccine candidates, which a decade later, unfortunately haven't crossed the finish line.So with a fairly personal connection with the disease, and the nonzero chance I could one day develop it myself, I have a personal interest in seeing progress in the space.I saw an IAVI update the other day stating TB research is currently only funded to the tune of 1 billion a year when they need 6. 10.5 million infections a year reported. Remember the countries where the disease have the biggest impact have limited diagnostic abilities outside of cities and politically, these countries are very quick to pretend the problem is solved when the reality is that TB started speeding up again in the covid days because the care programs for patients then was put on pause.If you wanna change the world and aren't just out for VC cash, go design a mobile X-Ray unit to take into villages, work on an AI model to diagnose from imagery, and work on figuring out how to speed up the testing because a MGIT machine needing power 24/7 is not the type of equipment you can always get in the places the disease impacts.Figure out how to get those little mycobacteria suckers to divide quicker in agar (my limited biology education tells me mess up the mycoic acid synthesis without killing it?) and then get people a positive result in 3 days instead of 3 weeks. Remember: the very good blood test (quantiferon gold) is banned in the largest country in the world because it comes back positive for the 1/3 of the population latently infected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42046247</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Adventures in Probability" explores various concepts and intriguing aspects of probability theory through engaging anecdotes and examples. It discusses the importance of probability in everyday decision-making, highlights common misconceptions, and illustrates how understanding probability can enhance critical thinking.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;my professor projected video of himself writing on a piece of paper before a very large auditorium, and that guy was left-handed, and so his hand would cover his notes for like the entire time and it was impossible to see what he was writing. I only figured out that this was why it was so unpleasant like halfway through the class.So many of my college math classes had some version of this professor who took a fascinating subject like linear algebra, statistics or algorithms and made it into a slog. The fact that most stats is taught by getting students to just memorize random ideas rather than building up a holistic and intuitive view really is a travesty.Also makes sense why so many people, even though they took stats in college, hav e such a poor understanding of probability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think if I were in charge of presenting this material to students I'd do it by introducing the concept of memorylessness and by showing how good memorylessness is, how many wonderful things you can do with it. And then one day I'd be like, "well, it sure would be nice if we had any distributions like that!" and then whirl around with my piece of chalk to deliver the exciting news that we do. Exactly one, in fact.Incidentally, this also goes for the determinant of a matrix. It's got a lot of neat and desirable properties, and it turns out to be the only thing that does. When it was finally taught to me this way, those weird algorithms we use to compute this seemingly-arbitrary number finally made sense. (And, in fact, this is the easiest way to prove that all those algorithms have to be computing the same seemingly-arbitrary number. Because the algorithms preserve the properties that define The Determinant, and The Determinant is the unique thing that preserves all of those properties, so must those algorithms all be computing The Determinant, no matter how different they might look.)So I can vouch that this style of explanation really does work, at least for people like me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisson processes are neat, they always end up working nicely in ways that many other distributions/processes very much don't.Splitting a Poisson process into two lower rate processes is a neat trick. Even better is that you can do the same to convert a Poisson process into one with a variable rate, provided that rate is lower than the original (original may be variable as well).And the fact that the partial sums of a bunch of exponential distributions results in the same distribution of values as picking Poisson(lambda * time) values uniformly at random is pure magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039327</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The page showcases an interactive tool that generates Moore Voronoi diagrams, which are a type of spatial partitioning based on distance to a set of seed points. Users can add seeds on a grid, and the application visually displays the regions associated with each seed, highlighting their influence areas. Additionally, the site explains the mathematical concepts behind Voronoi diagrams and their applications in various fields, such as urban planning and geographic information systems. The focus is on providing an engaging way to explore and understand these geometric structures through visualization and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author's archive of animations is very pleasing: https://bleuje.com/animationsite/2024_1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moore Curve [1] is a sequence of curves that ends up filling a square as the sequence goes to infinity, thus asymptotically mapping [0,1] to [0,1]^2. (phrasing might not be mathematically correct)So, my intuition tells me that what the site creator did is take the 4th Moore curve (which has 256 "corners") in the sequence, then spread 256 points on the [0,1] interval and map the later into the former. The output points then serve as cores for the Voronoi diagram [2]."Adding holes" in the 256 input points thus means to creates gaps in the 256 input points, possibly at regular interval. The animation happens when points slide from adjacent from the gap into the gap. I can't find the exact logic of which point moves when. However, all points move at the same time when there are exactly 128 holes (i.e. 128 points on the curve), and there are three batches of points that move one after the others when there are 64 holes (thus 3 batches of 64 points moving).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_curve[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hint: if you're on mobile, zoom out and go to the bottom left corner.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am from south India where a lot of wild elephants roam the villages and towns. When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Anchali figured out she could interrupt her colleague’s showers by picking the hose up with her trunk and kinking it to stop the water flow.The old tricks are the best tricks. Now wait for them to point the nozzle at their face and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elephants are really smart, and also quite emotional. They have been known to grieve, for very long periods of time, upon the death of babies or partners. Most animals get over it, fairly quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105098</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;I2P is an anonymous network designed to protect users' privacy and security while facilitating peer-to-peer communication and sharing. It operates through layered encryption, allowing users to access sites and services anonymously without revealing their identity. I2P is particularly focused on privacy, offering tools for secure browsing, file sharing, and communications, while also promoting decentralized applications and content hosting. The platform encourages users to contribute to its development and engage with the community for better anonymity and security solutions online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Death and Life of Prediction Markets at Google" discusses the rise and fall of Google's internal prediction markets, which were created to forecast various outcomes, such as employee performance and product success. It explores the motivations behind the establishment of these markets and their potential benefits for decision-making. However, it also delves into the challenges faced, including legal concerns and management skepticism, which ultimately led to their decline. The piece reflects on the lessons learned from Google's experiment with prediction markets and suggests the importance of fostering a culture of open data sharing to enhance forecasting accuracy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.Famously, Microsoft and others pioneered dogfooding decades before the events described in this article and approximately a decade (at least) before Google came into existence.And I’m 99% certain company cafes existed at least a half century before Google invented the concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the article would reflect on the problems with predictions markets, but it's just a dry history.Crucially, "predictions markets" do not and cannot exist in any real sense. A pure predictions market would be completely isolated, causality-wise, from the event they are trying to predict. But the two are not and cannot be isolated, except for some degenerate cases like trying to guess the output of a true random number generator (and even then I'm not so sure sufficiently motivated people wouldn't try to game the system anyway). This is why we have problems with our current predictions markets, e.g. the stock market (insider trading, etc.) and sports betting (match-fixing, etc.).Every prediction with a stake is an incentive to alter the outcome of an event. Once the weight of the stake outweighs the resources being used to ensure the impartiality of the outcome, the wheels fully come off the cart and the prediction stops being about the underlying event and starts self-referentially predicting the impact of the prediction itself. The snake eats its own tail and the market becomes useless. You cannot scale up a predictions market without this eventually coming to pass. See also the famous example of how a predictions market for when public figures will die is just an assassination market with extra steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google’s success wasn’t driven solely by its whimsical culture; the rapid growth of the market played a significant role as well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108360</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny, I maintain xfdesktop (the Xfce component that draws the desktop background and icons), and this past summer I just did a major refactor/rewrite of how xfdesktop saves and restores icon positions as well.Fortunately I didn't have as much trouble in the "reading code is the hardest part" dimension, as I was largely redoing code I myself wrote around 20 years ago (though others had changed it a bit in the meantime).It's fun to see a lot of the same problems I had when modeling how all of this should work.  Xfce 4.20 (probably end of next month) will have all of my changes for this, but of course I expect I've broken some things as well and will have to add in a bunch of little hacks and workarounds.  It's a truly weird, complex problem, even though at first look it feels like it should be simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know how wired earbuds always, always get tangled when you place them in a drawer or your pocket or something for few seconds?Do not wind them around your hand, this creates a curling force that makes them tangle. It’s a fundamental symmetry effect in action, with which you turn a straight line into a knot. Try the same with a flexible ruler tape and you’ll see how much it twists, unless you counter-twist every loop.Instead just gather the wire into a flat compressed /\/\…/\ form and put it there. The worst thing that will happen now is one accidental semi-knot that is trivial to shake away.Now I wonder how that applies to code, maybe we’re onto something here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title made me remember this other example of desktop icons being hard: https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invis...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42085490</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of Australia's 3G network shutdown, highlighting how it affects mobile phone users who rely on 4G and 5G devices for connectivity. It explains that while most modern devices connect to newer networks, older equipment, including some 4G phones that may have relied on 3G for certain functionalities, could be rendered unusable for specific services. The article emphasizes the need for users to understand their devices' compatibility with current networks and offers guidance on how to check and upgrade their phones to ensure continued service.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been handled differently in the UK from a regulatory point of view from an earlier time in the rollout of 4G/5G networks, so things seem to have worked out better.In the UK, carriers are only allowed to provide coverage in any given area to a phone if it is able to make an emergency call (999/112) in that area.i.e. if the phone says you have a signal, you must be able to make an emergency call.So, for a phone to actually show you as being connected to the network:a) There must be 2G/3G coverage available for a CSFB call to take place.orb) The phone must support VoLTE (including for emergency calls).Newer LTE (and 5G) spectrum deployments, like Band 20 LTE (800MHz), are being used to provide coverage in rural areas - even in places where there is no 2G/3G coverage, therefore these newer bands are often only made available to devices that support VoLTE.If you have an old phone, that doesn't support VoLTE (including for emergency calls), then it will only connect to 4G networks in areas where there is still an overlapping 2G/3G layer.This approach means that the carriers have had an incentive to make all devices support VoLTE with emergency calling. It has also been possible for the carriers to promote the 800MHz coverage as only being available on newer phones with VoLTE.Thus much of the problems that Australia is having have been avoided.Also:Data-only devices aren't included in this requirement, as they can't/don't make emergency calls.Roaming devices aren't affected (as far as I know).UK carriers support VoLTE roaming in the USA, given the lack of 2G/3G networks for CSFB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last minute change, and leaving it up to the carriers. Bad to the power of bad.I tend to buy grey import handsets because they offer a better value proposition - by a long margin - than locally sold handsets. Allowing the carriers to define the block list only plays into their greedy little hands.I know that "band 28" support is something useful to Australians who, like me, buy handsets from overseas. The support of handsets should be based on capabilities of the device, not a seemingly arbitrary list that's under the control of the carriers. But that's what happens when last minute decisions are made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s surprising the things that have been caught offguard by this.In Melbourne, the ticketing terminal in 200 trams and 2500 buses is now broken.https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/free-ride-as-myk...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103257</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried Pulumi 5 years ago because the idea looked cool and you could write code instead of HCL and apply things like loops etc.However, the problem I found was that a Pulumi provider has two "sides", one is on the Pulumi side of the provider, which sets up resources to be created, but doesn't update them with the details of what's been created.Example (may not be entirely accurate): You create a VPC, but then you want to use the default subnet as an input to another resource. You can't find out that subnet's information because when Pulumi runs, the "script" side doesn't get updated by the result of the VPC creation, so the information like the default subnet is "inside" the provider and not available to the user's script.Terraform updates the resource that has been created with the information from the creation, so you can access the underlying AWS information in further resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole tech looks kinda' cool, but this video...I've noticed a trend where some of the dev tooling nowadays is sold almost as if it were consumer goods with the whole associated marketing behind it. This doesn't work for me, in reality actually has completely opposite effect. Give me boring well-written docs, that shows engineering that went into it, not the marketing show for teenagers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers who are unfamiliar with SST would do well to read a bit about the project, the backing company, and the work they've been doing. Things have come around full-bore from serverless-only on AWS via CDK, putting huge effort into trying to make CDK fast and seamless, realizing they needed to support more than AWS and that CDK/CF are just too slow, transitioning into a Pulumi backend, supporting other clouds, and now, containers.SST is great because they built a model for infra-as-code that gives sensible defaults out-of-the-box while preserving enormous flexibility as the architecture grows, plus great conventions around giving code access to the environment details via bindings.Super excited to play with this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105797</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of evolving a NoSQL database schema, outlining the challenges and strategies involved in adapting the schema to accommodate changing data needs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the data and user requirements, and suggests techniques such as versioning, gradual migrations, and careful planning to minimize disruption. The author also highlights the significance of using appropriate databases and tools for specific use cases and provides insights into best practices for maintaining a flexible and scalable schema as applications grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would strongly recommend against using a fixed key 'user' for the hash key on dynamodb, with the range key being used to select the actual record. DDB does not handle splitting by range key very well, so you will run into load balance and throttling issues even with the sharding scheme (i.e. 'user!2') mentioned later.It will save you a lot of headaches to make the hash key the actual userid (e.g. 'user!abcdef123456'). This will make it more expensive if you do need to occasionally scan all users, but it's not drastically so. You can either do scan and ignore stuff you don't care about, or maintain an index that just contains the userids (in a similar hash/range key as the article) and then do point gets for each userid for the actual data. This will spread the load of these scans out better, because the range scan contains little data compared to if all user data is stored in the range key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very informative read … however, I am left not really understanding what the Entity Manager is … perhaps a migration tool to move data from NoSQL to RDBMS, perhaps a front end helper service? Is it FOSS, a PAYG service? How can I deploy it? Perhaps this article long enough already and is intended to whet our appetite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save yourself a ton of grief and don't use things like dynamodb unless you really have to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103788</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty amazing effort, this looks like a great labour of love!I can't give feedback on the code/technology, but on the writing on the lore section, I would try to simplify the writing. For instance the following:&gt; The reverberations of the trumpet stirred the knights from their deep repose, igniting a tumultuous awakening. With swords unsheathed and hearts ablaze, they clashed in a thunderous symphony of war, each seeking to claim dominance over the waking realm.Feels too ornate (purple prose) and could be more directly put as:&gt; The trumpet’s call jolted the knights from their rest. Swords drawn and hearts alight, they clashed in a fierce battle, each striving for dominance.I'm not an author or anything, but a little bit of copy writing could help - although this might just be me as it's probably a matter of personal taste!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's your experience been like with Nix?How do you feel about devenv vs stock Nix?

&lt;p&gt;The article "Boeing Wonderland: The Fake Cities on America's West Coast" explores the intricate and elaborate mock cities built by Boeing for testing and training purposes during the Cold War. These simulated environments, designed to resemble urban areas, were created to evaluate the performance of military aircraft and to prepare pilots for real-life scenarios. The piece highlights the ingenuity behind these constructions, their strategic significance, and how they shaped military aviation tactics during that era.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating. Funny side effect:&gt; Warner Brothers executives later insisted that their own lot receive the “Kelley Treatment.” They decided that their sound stages looked too much like aircraft hangers from the air, and feared that Japanese bombardiers, fooled by the Clover Field camouflage—or by Lockheed’s, only three miles to the north—would bomb their studio instead!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This cool. I grew up about a mile from one of these plants and it is wild to see the old photos. A story from my grandfather (probably not true) is that the week after Pearl Harbor Jack Warner had someone paint on the roof of the Warner Bros Studio something like “Hirohito, Northrop is over there”. When Jack Northrop heard this he was furious and gave Mr Warner one of the rare verbal lashings of his life. As a token of remorse Warner offered to lend the studio’s staff to help camouflage the aircraft plant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The very first name that came to my mind was Jasper Maskelyne. He led British camouflage efforts during WWII, and sure enough, while they don't come right out and say it, the mention of him studying British work makes me think that Ohmer must have worked with him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054327</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basically this is what Figma could be if you could add behavior to the UI. Somehow the web has been running backwards for years now. We lost flash in favor of HTML 5, which sort of fizzled out in terms of creative people actually doing a lot with it. We used to have simple application builders in IDEs like Visual Basic, Delphi, Borland JBuilder. Even Eclipse had a simple swing UI builder thing for a while. For the web we had dream weaver, frontpage, etc.I'm not saying those tools were perfect; because they weren't. But we never really got good substitutes for them. We now have people "designing" stuff in Figma and then handing over for implementation to some developer team that essentially then recreates the whole thing pretty much from scratch. There's something deeply stupid/wasteful about needing to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nicely done, now a Delphi and I can finally be happy about the state of development again.Sourcecode: https://github.com/BAndysc/AvaloniaVisualBasic6Edit: someone information about Lazarus deleted their comment, my answer;I know about Lazarus yes; I use it for my old projects. I would like a modern version that also works in-browser and .NET seems good for that as this shows. Maybe based on this https://pascalabc.net/en/ .Not kidding; I still enjoy Pascal/Lazarus (and common lisp) programming more than anything current; none of the anxiety and all of the joy and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was so productive in VB5/6 back in the late 90s/early 00s. I made tons of utility apps to solve all kinds of little problems. It was just so easy to put things together. I tried to make the transition to vb.net but it was not the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105869</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems fundamentally unsuitable for its stated purpose, which is “understanding human behavior”.While it may, as it says, produce “convincing interactions”, there is no basis at all peesented for believing it produces an accurate model of human behavior, so using it to “understand human behavior” is at best willful self-deception, and probably, with a little effort at tweaking inputs to produce the desired results, most often when used by someone who presents it as “enlightening productivity and business scenarios” it will be an engine for simply manufacturing support for a pre-selected option.It is certainly easier and cheaper than exploring actual human interactions to understand human behavior, but then so is just using a magic 8-ball, which may be less convincing, but for all the evidence supporting this is just as accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like this defaults to GPT-4o: https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/7ae16568ad1c4de...If you're going to try this out I would strongly recommend running it against GPT-4o mini instead. Mini is 16x cheaper and I'm confident the results you'll get out of it won't be 1/16th as good for this kind of experiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love jupyter notebooks. And, I'm amazed that a company like Microsoft would put a notebook front and center that starts off with a bunch of errors. Not a good look. I really think you can improve your AI marketing by a lot by creating compelling jupyter notebooks.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a study on the effectiveness of various healing practices, focusing on the influence of intention in the healing process. It highlights the lack of strong empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of alternative healing methods compared to conventional medicine. Through an analysis of different studies and approaches, the authors discuss the psychological aspects of healing and the potential benefits of belief and expectation in treatment outcomes. The paper ultimately calls for a more rigorous scientific examination of healing practices to establish their validity and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're increasingly aware today of how the media operates cycles of self-referential and self-justifying citations: a TV show will quote an article that reports "some people" taking an issue, which ends up being a quote from someone interviewed for another newspaper article.. and so on. This "legitimacy laundering" is rampant, and we're now getting towards media literacy levels which expose it for many people.However, most concerning: this is how academia has always worked. It's the great absurdity of peer review, and of citation. This is how entire fields can sustain themselves with little or no scientific validity (esp. see, psychometrics).We are no where near the equivalent "academic literacy" for generally informed members of the public to understand this problem. Entire fields can be sustained with zero "empirical pressure" to close down. So long as one can cite another who can cite another... and somewhere some government body will take these citations as prima facie evidence of a research programme, then funding will be given and more papers published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Besides the sociological problems listed, we must always be conscious of how counterintuitive and difficult statistical inference itself can be.  Good things to search for are statistical fallacies, probabilistic paradoxes and books like Counterexamples in Probability.And it is not sufficient to read about them once or twice; researchers who use statistical inference regularly must revisit these caveats at least as regularly.Myself, I have taught Probability and Statistics many times, discussed and dispelled many misconceptions by students.  Would I be 100% sure I will not be caught up in a fallacy while informally thinking about probability?  I wouldn't even be 10% sure; any intuition I conjure up, I would triple check as rigorously as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On page 11 there is a mention of taking the result of self reporting (surveys) at their word. I’ve wondered about this issue not just in science but other situations. For example political polling, data point in time surveys, census, etc. Without verification, what good is the data? And yet you often see such self reported data quoted by articles or papers as if it were factual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42049018</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses allegations that Apple threatened its employees regarding discussions about pay and remote work conditions, as charged by federal labor officials. The National Labor Relations Board is involved in the case, asserting that Apple's actions may have violated workers' rights to engage in discussions about their working conditions. The situation highlights ongoing concerns about employer practices in addressing employee rights, especially in the context of remote work and compensation transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has been saving my ticket stubs for 20+ years I was very frustrated by the disappearance of physical tickets. I paid the extra fee to have them mailed to me, but eventually that went away. Printed emails are not the same.I eventually figured out how to make the most realistic replica ticket stubs possible to add to my ticket stub album. I spent several thousands dollars on professional printers and real stock as well as months building my own software to customize and print tickets, all to scratch my own itch. Now my collection continues to grow with the 20 or so shows I go to every year and I've helped over 16,000+ people do the same with my website https://stubforge.com, which I'm now lucky enough to run full time.A lot of people don't get it, and that's ok, but for those that do, they really get it.People buy our tickets to give as gifts (because it's not easy to do anymore in a non-awkward or non-art project fashion), to add to their collections, to frame with posters, to use as surprise proposals, to invite people to their weddings, to announce their pregnancies and more things I never would have imagined when I started.There are people that do miss ephemera. Even if you don't look at it that often, it's something precious to you. It doesn't matter if your kids will get it or just chuck it, it's there for you to enjoy and remember in the fashion that you want to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They tell us what it was like to be there.Personal memories can be made in innumerable ways. The absence of tickets doesn't mean memories, or physical representations of memories, are going away.As for academic interest, I have to imagine there's a digital repository of playbills or the information therein somewhere that's easily searchable. After all, these types of resources exist for other performances like pro wrestling and mixed martial arts in the form of cagematch &amp; sherdog. I may not have my ticket stub from my first match, but I can still look it up by venue, year and the matches I remember. I can find contemporary news reports and reviews. This can be supplemented with web forum discussions and other social media, blogs, etc. people crave this type of discussion, documentation and artifacts that prove their fandom. I don't think they care about the medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of even an OPTION to get a proper, physical ticket makes TicketMaster's obscene rip-off even more outrageous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42080327</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent research suggesting that standing desks, often seen as a healthier alternative to sitting all day, may not provide the expected benefits. Instead, prolonged standing can lead to discomfort and health issues similar to those caused by extended sitting. The study highlights the importance of movement and breaks rather than simply switching from sitting to standing, advocating for a balanced approach that incorporates regular physical activity throughout the day to promote overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an article [1] from a few years ago from Cornell ergonomics researchers that is still relevant the discusses the pluses and minuses of both sitting and standing desks.Here is their recommendation:&gt; Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes. Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).[1] https://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tought this is common knowledge. Sitting all day - bad. Standing all day, also bad. Like, first docummented RSI were people standing at their stations in manufacturing, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study argues that movement is better than a static position (standing or sitting). Shocker.What they're obviously missing is that when you're at a standing desk, the friction to engaging in some kind of movement is drastically decreased (unless you're talking about spinning).While I stand at my desk, I frequently find myself pacing, jogging in place, stretching, etc. I don't have to first GET UP OUT OF A CHAIR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103761</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Apple's recent advertising strategy that emphasizes the company's advancements in artificial intelligence, arguing that the portrayal of AI as a groundbreaking achievement is misleading. It suggests that while Apple promotes its AI capabilities, the actual implementation and impact may not be as revolutionary as advertised. The author highlights concerns over the potential for such initiatives to distract from more pressing technological issues and questions the effectiveness of Apple's approach in genuinely enhancing user experience. Ultimately, the piece calls for a more transparent and realistic discussion about the role of AI in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

At no point in the world of the ad are these indicated by any of the other participants. Side character emotions are typically limited to confusion, interest, admiration, disbelief, and the ilk. Ultimately in each of the examples the participants are left holding what they "wanted", be it a sentimental birthday wish or a business correspondence that is "up to snuff".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy?This attitude seems aligned with Apple's general assumption (and apparent preference) that iOS users remain passive media consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111094</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR), which aims to promote the use of open-source software in public administrations across Europe. It offers resources, guidelines, and a repository of open-source projects to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among public sector organizations. The initiative seeks to support transparency, interoperability, and the reduction of costs associated with software development and procurement in government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So 16 coefficients are stored for a rank 3 wavelet function.With 16 DoF, can you handle more overlapping objects than a 16-long per-pixel list?Without fully understanding it, this reminds me of spherical harmonics in the way that juggling around the channels is convenient but it's not magic, you can only do so much with X degrees of freedom. (SH is a really nice way to store a low-res cubemap, but you would never use SH for env maps on something shiny) In the case of SH there are also artifacts introduced. I wonder how the wavelets behave when pushed too hard?Also, trying to be constructive - If there were still images with objects lined-up so we could compare the different techniques with a reference and see the difference, that would be easier to read than a lot of fast-moving randomly-colored objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first real brick wall I met when learning computer graphics, interesting how seemingly simple things in computer graphics is actually non-trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when I was looking into this at one point in time. I was trying to figure out a good implementation that didn't require you to store multiple different positions. The most I really ever got was a reverse order transparency [1] which employs some stuff similar to the article.My plan was basically render everything opaque first, then render transparency front to back till the layer became opaque (discard all pixels under an already opaque pixel), and of course exclude everything further away than the depth buffer of the opaque layer.Might be interesting to actually go and finish the implementation to test it out, I just never had a good test scene with a lot of transparency (with an opaque layer since half my benefit comes from that.)[1] https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msyGDR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106477</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ineffectiveness of traditional security controls in protecting organizations from threats. It argues that security measures often create a false sense of security and highlights the need for a more adaptive approach that focuses on understanding actual risks rather than simply implementing standardized controls. The author emphasizes the importance of developing a security mindset that prioritizes critical thinking and contextual awareness over compliance with set protocols. Overall, the piece calls for a reevaluation of how security is approached in order to improve resilience against evolving challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been thinking about this topic thru the lens of moral philosophy lately.A lot of the “big lists of controls” security approaches correspond to duty ethics: following and upholding rules is the path to ethical behaviour. IT applies this control, manages exceptions, tracks compliance, and enforces adherence. Why? It’s the rule.Contrast with consequentialism (the outcome is key) or virtue ethics (exercising and aligning with virtuous characteristics), where rule following isn’t the main focus. I’ve been part of (heck, I’ve started) lots of debates about the value of some arbitrary control that seemed out of touch with reality, but framed my perspective on virtues (efficiency, convenience) or outcomes (faster launch, lower overhead). That disconnect in ethical perspectives made most of those discussions a waste of time.A lot of security debates are specific instances of general ethical situations; threat models instead of trolley problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of the security "industry" is about useless compliance, rather than actual security. The chimps have put their fears into large enterprise compliance documents. This teaches the junior security people at enterprise companies that these useless fears are necessary, and they pass them along to their friends. Why? Not just because of chimps and fear, but also $$. There is a ton of money to be made off of silly chimps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ironic thing about the chimp story is that probably chimps are immune to the problem and humans are the only species that would fall for it. It takes chimps a long time to learn to copy others. I doubt they could sustain a superstition like this for long even if you managed to induce it through great effort.It's humans that copy each other without a second thought. It's a great heuristic on average. These kinds of fables are correctives against our first instinct to replicate other's behaviors, but if we actually tried to reason through everything from first principles we'd never get anything done.Copying is the plain pieces in the lucky charms, thinking things through is the marshmallows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110149</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; byoyomi has all but been replaced by Canadian OvertimeNote that this is from 1997. It was common to use clocks in Europe that were unable to do proper Japanese style byoyomi and we did not have one timekeeper per board in tournaments. When I run out of time we paused the clock, I put for example 15 stones in front of me, closed the stone box, set my the clock for example to 10 minutes and start playing again. I would lose if I ended the time again with any stone left in front of me.Clocks that could do byoyomi, and multiple rounds of it, started to be widespread not much after those years. I think we used them in the European Championship of 1996. A common byoyomi was 30 seconds per move. If I had one euro per each time I heard a clock saying "30 seconds one time" I'd be rich.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Go players I know prefer the simplicity and elegance of Fischer time [1].
No more pausing the clock to count out N stones, or worries about using less
time than allotted for your N moves and wasting the rest.
I don't mind seeing byoyomi become a relic of the past...[1] https://polgote.com/en/blog/time-controls-go-byo-yomi-fische...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the time settings that are or were historically used in Go tournaments had their own quirks and idiosyncrasies that added charm to the time management issue. At the same time, I can understand the tediousness of Canadian being an argument not to use it anymore. Last time I played with it was at a tournament in Brussels where they were using old-school chess clocks, effectively making it the only viable solution.Nowadays, as mentioned, Fischer trumps all with its simplicity, but some still enjoy playing with byoyomi (supported both by newer chess clocks and by old Ing clocks), since they got used to managing their thinking time in regular intervals once base time was spent. Personally, I've been advocating using Fischer for the longest time, since said management strategies were more natural to me in this case, and I'm glad DGT clocks became the common standard at tournaments now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42038219</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. I particularly liked this observation:&gt; Shipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.A lot of the ideas in here resonated with me a lot. This is the kind of article I wish I'd read before I spent a few years leading an engineering team at a medium-sized tech company!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post is about corporate politics, not "shipping projects."  To wit:  If you ship something users hate and makes no money, but 
  your leadership team is happy, you still shipped. You can 
  feel any way you like about that, but it’s true. If you 
  don’t like it, you should probably go work for companies 
  that really care how happy their users are.

When the stated goal is to make leadership happy and not solving customer problems such that customers are "happy", that is pretty much the definition of politics.  As subsequently identified therein:  Engineers who think shipping means delivering a spec or 
  deploying code will repeatedly engineer their way into 
  failed ships.

I would question the ethics of engineers whom employ a strategy of preferring politics over delivering solutions.EDIT: clarified the ethical question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There should be a hardware product version of this, you software people have no idea.- Have endless arguments about what to name the product- Have industrial design team enforce the latest design language- Create product variant SKU numbers, get them loaded into ordering system.  Get buy-in from sales on these variants.- Create part numbers for the FRUs and CRUs.- Create multi-level BOM for all the variants.- Buy replacement parts and push them into parts depots- Calculate reliability so that warranty department knows how much to charge you- Get agency approvals- Create packaging- Test packaging- Translate any words on the package into french (for Canada)- Get vendors to sign your big company environmental requirements document- Write legal notices and get it translated into many languages- Work with documentation team to get printed (usually short) manual translated into many languages- Get safety engineer to sign off on products, usually means you need to make a bunch of stickers and include them in the BoM.- Figure out the part numbers for the power cords needed for each country- Figure out the part numbers for the rack mount rail kits for various types of racks that you support- Write announcement letter- Create videos and documents for sales team training- Write troubleshooting guide- Train repair centeretc..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111031</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The project "I Don't Have Spotify" aims to provide a solution for users who want to access curated Spotify playlists without needing a Spotify account. It allows users to browse music recommendations and playlists, offering alternative links to online streaming platforms. The repository includes instructions for setup and usage, along with code examples for developers interested in contributing or customizing the tool. The focus is on enhancing music accessibility for those who may not want or be able to use Spotify directly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know of a even more impressive website that will transfer playlists from Spotify (or 20 other platforms, including text files) to 20 other platforms or a text file. I will share the link, but don't hug it to death y'all. :)https://app.tunemymusic.com/transfer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a very simple chrome extension that automatically redirects you to your preferred music service when visiting another service. In my case I have it set to YouTube Music, so if I click a Spotify (or other) link in Slack, I'll be redirected to YouTube Music.https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/music-link/gnhphofp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to actually buy music and store it myself, as I've started noticing more and more that some of the songs I have on Spotify have started to disappear, but I find it very difficult to buy modern music anymore. Most gets released as singles, and as far as I know, to only streaming platforms. Is there a way to still buy the same kind of music that is on streaming platforms, and actually get the audio files?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110877</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expected to spend a couple of minutes browsing this, yet 25 minutes later I'm not even halfway through.The best (so far) are the ones above the strings "on June 2nd, 1940" and "effort by Russian War Relief". I can't imagine the amount of research and sheer work (especially pre-internet) to create these.I was a kid who played SimCity 2000, RISK, and had tons of books about geography. Having physical pieces of paper that I'd spend minutes or hours analyzing was so satisfying. Scrolling around Google Earth or doing GIS-based analysis is also satisfying, but I really got a kick out of looking at this post (putting aside the seriousness of WW2).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently finished a large World War II project that covered the full timeline of the war, and Google Maps was a valuable tool to follow what was happening in any given battle. The problem is Google Maps has more detail than you need, so trying to follow something like Operation Market Garden is much more difficult than just looking at this beautiful battle map: https://www.alamy.com/a-bridge-too-far-image68088140.html. "The West Point Atlas of War" is another great resource.Maps cover the spatial side of war, but in addition it's difficult to follow the timeline. My project stitched popular World War II movies together into a chronological series, making it easier to see what was happening across the world at any given time. You can view the episodes and the full blog post here: https://open.substack.com/pub/ww2supercut/p/combining-143-wo.... And in addition "The Second World War" by Churchill's biographer Martin Gilbert, is a chronological, 750 page book that I couldn't put down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 1944 World Almanac. It's incredibly detailed on World War Two - by my count, page 31 and 35-113 are mostly or totally devoted to it, in addition to the various bits on armies scattered throughout. Sometimes I look at it just to see what happened on that particular day (for instance: today, German forces landed in Leros, in the Aegean Sea, which was at the time held by the British, among many other events - and that just in 1943!) There are also some incredibly detailed war maps which I sometimes look at. At some point I should probably get around to uploading them, as they are absolutely amazing and I'd like to share it, but it's always near the bottom of my to-do list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110588</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the GitHub plugin created by the author, which addresses concerns raised by coworkers about code maintainability and collaboration. The plugin offers a solution to improve code quality by providing features that encourage best practices and enhance communication among team members. The author reflects on their experiences with the plugin's development, the feedback received from coworkers, and how it aims to foster a healthier coding environment by avoiding common pitfalls and promoting clearer documentation. Overall, the piece highlights the importance of teamwork and thoughtful coding in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the features of https://codescene.com/It looks for knowledge islands and relates those to frequently modified code, to identify hotspot, or areas of high risk due to low knowledge distribution in areas of high change.Another use is if someone hands in their notice you can easily see all the code that only they know, so your handover planning is mapped out easily.I’ve never thought of it being used maliciously, it’s for visibility. It would be a shitty manager that would use it that way and if they’re already shitty then this tool won’t change that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon has these numbers easily accessible as reports on their code systems runnable at any manager level, and many other ways to inspect what the team is doing and the risks you might have. I find them useful.Bus factor is one way to think of it. Another is it lets you spot silos, or engineers who aren't working with others, or places where you can't as easily move engineers around (so you can fix that).Some developers fear fungability, they think that that one system only they know is job security. I see it the other way, I see that as a technical risk, but also a thing that might be keeping a great engineer from working on more important projects. Or the way to work on something else when you get fed up with that one system you hate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why does gnu parallel use all the cores when we tell it to use only 8? We only saw eight git clone processes at a time, but a large number of git index-pack processes that maxed out all 32 cores on my laptop. I’m guessing git’s index-pack is a forked subprocess and allows parallel to start another git clone?Parallel is running 8 git clone jobs at once (as asked for) and each git clone is starting as many index-pack threads as it wants. Temporarily setting pack.threads to 1 (via git config) would help here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111260</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "leaving and waving," highlighting the emotional complexities involved in farewells and transitions. It emphasizes the significance of acknowledging both the sorrow of parting and the importance of embracing new beginnings. The author shares personal insights and reflections on the experiences of leaving behind familiar places and people, encouraging readers to find ways to honor their connections while also embracing change. Through themes of gratitude and acceptance, the piece serves as a reminder of the dual nature of farewells and the potential for growth that comes with them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing up I didn't really know my father. He was an alcoholic and spent his time with his friends drinking when I was young. My parents separated when I was around 8 years old and I haven't seen my father since, even till this day (I am around 30).I was never really close with my mother. We would eat dinner in separate rooms. We grew more and more distant throughout my teen years and when I was 20 I decided to disown her and we're now estranged.There were multiple attempts to "get back" but none were successful. I think what I realised in the end was that she was too much of a free spirit. She wanted to have her separate life and have me co-exist in it, without dedicating herself to me like a parent normally would.I don't think I'll miss them or feeling anything for them when they pass. My mother, maybe a little. My father, not at all. But I don't forsee being at her death bed, even if she told me she was dying. Maybe I'm just stubborn or am held captive by a matter of "principle and integrity". If a relationship is cut off, then it's cut off. Meaning you both have to deal with the good and the bad. I've decided there's more good than bad.In some senses it feels like I never had parents at all. Like there's nothing to miss, because how can one miss an absence?I hope though to be the parent I never had to my daughter. Unfortunately my partner has stage 4 cancer so won't be around for most of my daughter's life at a very young age, but that's okay. This is life and life is me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The finality of death feels impossible to grasp. I think of this with my parents who are in their 90s and live on the other side of the world. I also think of it with my own children - how do you say goodbye when you’re the one leaving?I love the story these photographs tell. I’m an avid archiver of our family’s photos.The other thing I did was to interview my parents 20 years ago to document their life experience in one go from their perspective (separately, because they are different).Maybe not everyone is a nostalgic, but for those of us who are - I encourage doing these things now. It’s never to late to start and they might bring comfort both today and when you wave your last goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made me think of this bit from Tim Urban’s classic blog post, The Tail End[0]:&gt;It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.[0] https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113113</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving innovation across various sectors, emphasizing its potential to transform industries, enhance productivity, and foster economic growth. It outlines key areas where AI is making significant impacts, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, and examines the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its implementation. The piece also highlights the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and educational institutions, to harness AI's capabilities responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115310"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the conclusions:&gt; I find that AI substantially boosts materials discovery, leading to an increase in patent filing and a rise in downstream product innovation. However, the technology is effective only when paired with sufficiently skilled scientists.I can see the point here. Today I was exploring the possibility of some new algorithm. I asked Claude to generate some part which is well know (but there are not a lot of examples on the internet) and it hallucinated some function. In spite of being bad, it was sufficiently close to the solution that I could myself "rehallucinate it" from my side, and turn it into a creative solution. Of course, the hallucination would have been useless if I was not already an expert in the field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Survey evidence
reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82% of scientists report reduced
satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.”What an interesting finding and not what I was expecting. Is this an issue with the UX/tooling? Could we alleviate this with an interface that still incorporates the joy of problem solving.I haven’t seen any research that Copilot and similar tools for programmers have a similar  reduction in satisfaction. Likely with how much the tools feel like an extension of traditional auto complete, and you still spend a lot of time “programming”. You haven’t abandoned your core skill.Related: I often find myself disabling copilot when I have a fun problem I want the satisfaction of solving myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The tool automates a majority of “idea
generation” tasks, reallocating scientists to the new task of evaluating model-suggested candidate
compounds. In the absence of AI, researchers devote nearly half their time to conceptualizing
potential materials. This falls to less than 16% after the tool’s introduction. Meanwhile, time spent
assessing candidate materials increases by 74%"So the AI is in charge, and mostly needs a bunch of lab assistants."Machines should think. People should work." - not a joke any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115310</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impressive energy efficiency and performance of the M4 Mac Minis, highlighting their capabilities for various tasks, including development and content creation. The author shares personal experiences with the device, emphasizing its low power consumption while delivering remarkable processing power. Additionally, the article compares the M4 Mac Mini's performance with other systems and provides insights into its advantages for both home and professional use, making a case for its value as a computing choice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Linux, but I think the cheapest M4 Mini offers an incredible value and efficiency per €. With education discount, it's around €650, including VAT. It's pretty hard to find such a silent and powerful machine for that little. Any comparable options?A good fanless build with a i3-14100T is more expensive and 40-50% slower on Geekbench. An i5 is a bit closer. Some 2024 Ryzen CPUs can match or exceed its multicore performance, but these are also more expensive and much less energy efficient. Pricewise, things start favoring PCs if you need more RAM, as Mac upgrades are costly.One can potentially use Nix on a Mac Mini to keep similar development environments to those used in Linux, but AFAIK some packages are not supported on ARM. Any experiences using Nix and nix-darwin as a daily driver?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom.”While I think Apple was off the rocker on this particular decision, I do respect their org structure that allows this type of decision to occur. Believe me, there are companies where a dozen people or more would weigh in and prevent an unpopular choice. Consensus sometimes hinders a desired result (both good and bad).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mac mini M4 performance is around 4-5x in DaVinci Resolve for me - compared to my HP laptop (i5-1135G7).Rendering HDR video was around 12fps there on the i5 - the same project in the Mac mini gets 60fps.The M4 10 core GPU seems on par or better with a mobile RTX3060(65W) for video tests (NR / Deflicker) so I'm also impressed about the M4's efficiency. A lot of power per Watt.It's becoming a dedicated video rendering machine for me where all the SMB auto mounting issues with macOS seem solvable. Pretty happy so far with the base model price even in the EU. The power button placement is an annoyance for me, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120311</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the innovative use of Apple AirPods as a makeshift hearing aid, highlighting how users have discovered ways to optimize the earbuds for amplifying sound and improving listening experiences in various environments. It explores the technology behind the AirPods, detailing the features that make them suitable for this purpose, while also addressing the implications for hearing assistance accessibility and the potential impact on traditional hearing aids. The piece reflects on user experiences and the growing trend of repurposing consumer electronics for health-related functions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Hearing aids typically cost anywhere from ₹ 50,000 to upwards of ₹ 8L depending on the correction capabilityFor those who don't recognize the ₹ symbol it is the symbol for the Indian Rupee and an "L" after a number means 100,000, so ₹ 8L is ₹ 800,000.At current exchange rates that puts hearing aids in India from $600 to upwards of $9,500.AirPods Pro 2 are ₹ 24,900 ($295).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It appears that the Hearing Aid feature is actually an equalizer preset that is pushed to the AirPods and will replace your transparency mode.Apple could've just not marketed these as "hearing aids" or used the medical terminology, as every other TWS with parametric EQ and transparency mode can do the same thing, and they wouldn't have the regulatory hawks going after them. They only lose the marketing edge, but perhaps that was a huge calculated risk.There's an incredible amount of processing power and flexibility in these things. Even the sub-$10 ones using the infamous JieLi SoCs - a 160MHz 32-bit computer in each ear. I'm surprised there hasn't yet been any TWS advertised with open-source firmware, although there's been some work in the usual Chinese (and Russian) communities on customisations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Since WiFi and a microwave operate at the same frequency (2.4GHz), we ran our leaky microwave at full power to block out any persistent network signals in the air.Incidentally, WiFi tries to intentionally avoid this interference.  Microwaves output no power during the zero crossing of the AC line that's driving it, and in this interval, there is no signal in the air to jam things.  WiFi listens before sending (so as to avoid stepping on other stations), and the microwave's signal is enough to trigger this.  (I forget if microwave ovens are "half wave" and you get 1/120th of a second 60 times a second, or if there is just a threshold near the zero crossing where there isn't enough power to interfere.)I would say it's likely that the microwave oven didn't really do much here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118399</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports on the incident involving a Marine Corps pilot who lost command after ejecting from an F-35B aircraft that continued to fly for an extended distance before crashing. The incident raised significant safety and operational concerns, prompting investigations into the circumstances surrounding the pilot's decision to eject and the aircraft's capabilities. The piece highlights the complexities of flying advanced military jets and the potential consequences of such emergencies for pilots and their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're familiar with USA military history, the Americans are (were) famous for not doing things by the book for the right reasons, and letting common sense prevail, as well as incentivizing good outcomes.“A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.”“The reason that the American Navy does so well in wartime is that war is chaos, and the Americans practice chaos on a daily basis.”So heavily simplifying things and with 20/20 hindsight this pilot essentially didn't do the right thing, even if through no fault of their own, and apparently in the US Navy you don't get rewarded for doing the wrong thing. This is what keeping incentives aligned looks like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The report criticizes the pilot for ejecting, but also says he did everything by the book (F35 manual), but the book was wrong. And the pilot should've figured that out? Feels like they just need someone to blame for losing the plane.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brief summary and my understanding of why this occurred:    - Pilot ejects, survives while losing very expensive plane
    - The crash is Marine's third in several weeks, the other two having fatalities; leads to a safety stand down across the entire corps
    - Investigation concludes that ejection was unnecessary and so fault of the crash is on the pilot, however adding that the procedures written were overly broad
    - Pilot is offered to lead VMX-1 after all this; key part of the responsibility is improving procedures

Reading between the lines, it appears that somewhere in the leadership was a belief that putting the pilot in charge of VMX-1 was an opportunity for both; let the guy who made a mistake move forward as they'll be least likely to make it twice kind of thing. General Eric disagreed and ordered him out; it's not stated whether that was based on his own judgement only or if others in VMX-1 lost confidence and that factored in. Nobody disagrees that they have the ability to fire him for what happened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098475</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of defensive communication in interpersonal conflicts, highlighting how individuals often react defensively when they feel threatened. It explores the psychological mechanisms behind defensive communication, such as rationalization and denial, and examines various strategies to foster more constructive communication. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own defensive responses and the impact they can have on resolving conflicts, advocating for open dialogue and active listening to improve relationships and communication outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“As a person becomes more and more defensive, he or she becomes less and less able to perceive accurately the motives, the values and the emotions of the sender.”Such a great insight. The content of defensive communication isn’t a requirement here. Anything that increases the defensiveness of the communicator/listener lowers the ability to perceived.Fear makes us stupid. No plan for future civilization can succeed on fear-based tactics alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an insightful read. Especially for its time! I struggle with being defensive at home; for example if a mistake that I've made is pointed out, my first reaction is to deny or look for excuses rather than to empathise with the other person, who may be feeling upset and unheard as something has happened for the nth time. For some reason, this doesn't happen to anywhere near the same degree at work, where I am fully able to own my mistakes and look for ways forward.Text at this level of emotional abstraction can be quite difficult to internalise, especially for those with less practise or who might be "on the spectrum". It's helpful to have one or two illustrative examples in each category. For example:Evaluative: "Sort out your code before sending it for review, it's an absolute mess yet again and wastes my time."Descriptive: "After an initial review I can see code style issues A, B, C, some of which also occured in PRs X, Y, Z. Please make sure you're checking through for these in future review request as it would greatly streamline the review process."Also, listing out a set of categories is useful, and even sufficient for many people. But it doesn't tell you how to stop being defensive, just what being defensive looks like and how to deal with defensiveness in others. Defensiveness often stems from some insecurity about yourself. Reassuring that insecurity can resolve the issue. In my above example with Evaluative and Descriptive text, the speaker may be more evaluative if they're stressed about time-pressures and resent having to mentor more junior employees. It might be helpful for them to cultivate the part of themselves that values broad, long-term knowledge and skills growth in the team, and to take some perspective regarding the relative seriousness of those time pressures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder, is there any research on offensive communication? Like, people who seize control of a conversation by going on the attack, who respond to another person's statements by changing the subject to something they've done wrong. Defensive communication is unattractive and tends to be ineffective, and I think there are people who pursue a consistent strategy of trying to make others look bad by triggering defensive behavior in them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113449</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a short blog post about my thought process on how I reverse engineer video games and build tools that enable me to do security testing on them.
It’s a bit brief on purpose, as reading the code is expected.
Let me know your thoughts and what would make it better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a wonderful app MS-DOS resident (TSR) on my PC that when pressing a key would do a snapshot of the whole memory (or specific area) to disk, to a file. So if you play a game, and lose a live, or HP points, you keep on pressing this, and then there were tools to do the diff.There was one game that was storing the lifes as actual text - Ninja or something....So last year my son was hacking some games, and nowadays there is a similar tool too - also based on diffs - though with me back then it was only 640KB, and nowadays we are looking towards 8-16GB if not more!Somehow this technique still works for some games, but with way more gotchas...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the end user perspective "let's game it out" is a must see YouTube channel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42088996</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the Neumann Architecture, a foundational concept in computer science that outlines how computers process data and instructions. It explains the key components, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices, and how they interact to execute programs. The piece emphasizes the architecture's significance in the development of modern computing systems, highlighting its influence on software design and efficiency. Additionally, it touches on the limitations of Neumann Architecture, such as the von Neumann bottleneck, which can hinder performance in complex applications. Overall, the article serves as an informative overview of Neumann Architecture and its implications in the field of computing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don't recognize the title, this is a reference to the classic:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090.The_Soul_of_a_New_M...which was one of the first computer books I ever read --- I believe in an abbreviated form in _Reader's Digest_ or in a condensed version published by them (can anyone confirm that?)EDIT: or, maybe I got a copy from a book club --- if not that, must have gotten it from the local college after prevailing upon a parent to drive me 26 miles to a nearby town....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of identifying ‘bit flips’ in papers, which are (if I am following along) statements which precipitate or acknowledge a paradigm shift.Perhaps the most important bit-flip of this paper’s time (and perhaps first fully realized in it) might be summarized as ‘instructions are data.’This got me thinking: today, we are going through a bit-flip that might be seen as a follow-on to the above: after von Neumann, programs were seen to be data, but different from problem/input data, in that the result/output depends on the latter, but only through channels explicitly set out by the programmer in the program.This is still true with machine learning, but to conclude that an LLM is just another program would miss something significant, I think - it is training, not programming, that is responsible for their significant features and capabilities. A computer programmed with an untrained LLM is more closely analogous to an unprogrammed von Neumann computer than it is to one running any program from the 20th. century (to pick a conservative tipping point.)One could argue that, with things like microcode and virtual machines, this has been going on for a long time, but again, I personally feel that this view is missing something important - but only time will tell, just as with the von Neumann paper.This view puts a spin on the quote from Leslie Lamport in the prologue: maybe the future of a significant part of computing will be more like biology than logic?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the paper: https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/Prelim_Disc_...&gt; 6.8.5 ... There should be some means by which the computer can signal to the operator when a computation has been concluded. Hence an order is needed ... to flash a light or ring a bell.(later operators would discover than an AM radio placed near their CPU would also provide audible indication of process status)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112817</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We used to create private Google groups with corresponding team and Google would provide a shared email like sales@ourdomain.com. Now admin has more control over who gets the shared mails. It is essentially free but with few caveats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone use a tool like this for shared family email? As the kids are getting older and there's email communication from daycare and school and extracurriculars and everything else, the method of "all communication about X goes to one parent" is not really scaling. Just using one shared gmail could also work, but requires more communication around "are you handling that response or am I?".It seems like fundamentally the same problem as this tool is solving, but when it's for family instead of business, even $30/month starts to feel pretty pricey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will you keep your price so low?I've been burned too many times on "simple, cheap, multi-user" shared inboxes. Most recently Groove HQ where it went from $20 for our team of 3 to $45/seat for our team of 5 over the course of a few years. It was still worth it, but when I left that company, I had to switch to a shared gmail account because I'm not dropping $135/mo for a software project that may or may not take off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119042</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence of alternative search engines like Ecosia and Qwant that aim to provide privacy-focused and environmentally sustainable options compared to Google. Ecosia generates revenue through ads and invests profits into tree planting initiatives, promoting ecological benefits, while Qwant emphasizes user privacy by not tracking personal data or search histories. Both platforms are part of a growing movement challenging Google's dominance in the search engine market, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations in technology usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't believe a single second the marketing speech about these 2 engines, they are both total crap trying to gain users with whatever hype subject is around.Qwant used to pretend being a champion of privacy, a "french made" tech, but with a search engine mostly based on Bing, lobbying with Microsoft against our interests, and with a boss sucking as much public funding as possible to finance luxury HQ locations and lavish cars...Qwant collapsed and was sold, but now it is just a mediocre ghost product trying to capitalize on a stained branding and on being a French/european alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every new search engine I've seen was a Bing wrapper with sometimes light reranking.I understand that competing with Google was borderline impossible a decade ago. But in 2024, we have cheap compute, great OSS distributed DBs, powerful new vector search tech. Amateur search engines like Marginalia even run on consumer hardware. CommonCrawl text-only is ~100TB, and can fit on my home server.Why is no company building their own search engine from scratch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, it seems the direction for search is going 
towards AI sites.  (Gemini, ChatGPT)Trying to reinvent Google/ Search in 2024 seems 
a bit like jumping the shark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42114990</guid></item><item><title>15.

I've been trying to manage libvirt&amp; Unraid through terraform, but have run into issue after issue. I'm about given up, and will just manage the virtual machines manually...What's the virtualization technology on proxmox?What's the advantage to using something like this as opposed to terraform or salt stack or Ansible?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been looking into setting up my first Proxmox box, here is my take as a newcomer.I wanted to do what I think is a very basic and very common setup: Modem &gt; proxmox box &gt; OPNsense VM &gt; physical wifi router via onboard 10Gb NIC + internal network VMs like OMV etc. The goal is to add a full network filter via OPNsense, and allow access to a media sever and backup etc from the internal network.I see no OPNsense, OMV script is basically contra-indicated because it should be a VM instead of the LXC container, and I don't see any glue scripts to get VMs talking to each other, which is an important part of Proxmox configuration. So it looks like there is room here to get some basic setup scripts for a simple home server either improved or added to the collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118286</guid></item><item><title>17.

And have the snippet of Python code I provide run inside a WebAssembly container that runs one of the Python compiled to WASM builds (https://github.com/brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build for example) - with a time limit and restrictions on memory usage, and file system access, and network access.I am on a continued quest to figure out the cleanest way to achieve this, I have so many projects I would want to build on top of this capability!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having worked heavily with gRPC before I like how syntactically similar WIT is to proto.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While investigating issues like KAFKA-17754, we also encountered unseen writes in Kafka. Owing to time constraints we have not investigated this behavior, but unseen writes could be a sign of hanging transactions, stuck consumers, or even data loss. We are curious whether a delayed Produce message could slide into a future transaction, violating transactional guarantees. We also suspect that the Kafka Java Client may reuse a sequence number when a request times out, causing writes to be acknowledged but silently discarded. More Kafka testing is warranted.Seems like Jepsen should do another Kafka deep-dive. Last time was in 2013 (https://aphyr.com/posts/293-call-me-maybe-kafka, Kafka version 0.8 beta) and seems like they're on the verge of discovering a lot of issues in Kafka itself. Things like "causing writes to be acknowledged but silently discarded" sounds very scary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m looking at the product page [0] and wondering how those two statements are compatible:&gt; Bufstream runs fully within your AWS or GCP VPC, giving you complete control over your data, metadata, and uptime. Unlike the alternatives, Bufstream never phones home.&gt; Bufstream pricing is simple: just $0.002 per uncompressed GiB written (about $2 per TiB). We don't charge any per-core, per-agent, or per-call fees.Surely they wouldn’t run their entire business on the honor system?[0] https://buf.build/product/bufstream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very surprised by this:&gt; [with the default enable.auto.commit=true] Kafka consumers may automatically mark offsets as committed, regardless of whether they have actually been processed by the application. This means that a consumer can poll a series of records, mark them as committed, then crash—effectively causing those records to be lostThat's never been my understanding of auto-commit, that would be a crazy default wouldn't it?The docs say this:&gt; when auto-commit is enabled, every time the poll method is called and data is fetched, the consumer is ready to automatically commit the offsets of messages that have been returned by the poll. If the processing of these messages is not completed before the next auto-commit interval, there’s a risk of losing the message’s progress if the consumer crashes or is otherwise restarted. In this case, when the consumer restarts, it will begin consuming from the last committed offset. When this happens, the last committed position can be as old as the auto-commit interval. Any messages that have arrived since the last commit are read again. If you want to reduce the window for duplicates, you can reduce the auto-commit intervalI don't find it amazingly clear, but overall my understanding from this is that offsets are committed _only_ if the processing finishes. Tuning the auto-commit interval helps with duplicate processing, not with lost messages, as you'd expect for at-least-once processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115611</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hadn’t noticed the announcement of the vulnerability, looks like it’s nothing I care about for my “thread model”.https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235635/yubikey-unfixable...&gt;“The attacker would need physical possession of the YubiKey, Security Key, or YubiHSM, knowledge of the accounts they want to target, and specialized equipment to perform the necessary attack,” the company said in its security advisory. “Depending on the use case, the attacker may also require additional knowledge including username, PIN, account password, or authentication key.” But those aren’t necessarily deterrents to a highly motivated individual or state-sponsored attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant bit:&gt; Update: Ist sogar noch krasser, wie ein Leser anmerkt:&gt; zu der Yubikey-Geschichte sei noch angemerkt, dass die aktuell sogar so dreist sind erstmal ihre Lagerbestände mit verwundbaren Keys abzuverkaufen anstatt die zu verschrotten. Hab neulich zwei von den Dingern bestellt (die teure FIPS-Variante!) und was bekomme ich geliefert? Die Keys mit der alten, verwundbaren Firmware. Hintergrund soll wohl sein, dass die zunächst Behörden und andere "priorisierte" Kunden mit den Keys mit der neuen Firmware beliefern.Machine Translation:&gt; Update: It's even more extreme, as a reader points out:&gt; Regarding the Yubikey story, it should be noted that they are currently so brazen as to sell off their stock of vulnerable keys instead of scrapping them. I recently ordered two of those things (the expensive FIPS version!) and what do I get delivered? The keys with the old, vulnerable firmware. The background seems to be that they are initially supplying authorities and other "prioritized" customers with the keys that have the new firmware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem here is that depending on your threat model it might be important for customers to trust Yubico not to sell out against rich/powerful attackers. This behavior adds a datapoint that speaks against them, even if they are technically correct.I do not expect a manufacturer of such hardware to be like: "Eh it is okay" when skipping the fix to their IC manufacturers fuckup saves them money, I expect them to go out of their way to protect their customers. Seen like this their refusal to replace compromised keys was already brazen, them selling compromised keys constitutes a breach of trust.I am already researching for alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110901</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blaming all ills of any Japanese industry on the keiretsu is in vogue for decades, but at best, keiretsu is a symptom, not a cause, of the underlying risk-averse culture.  Keiretsu, even when they were toxically anti-competitive, did not go out of their ways to crush would-be global startups in Japan; keiretsu, by the author's own argument, didn't care about the global software-only market, thus would not kill those startups.  The true culprit, the risk-averse culture -- while with own merits -- did not mesh well with the more fluid flat culture of software development.It was not an accident that software did well in the most hippy region in the US, San Francisco.  On the contrary, hardware development, due to much more constraints from the laws of physics and economics, has been done well in Japan et al as careful top-down planning is the edge, not individual-level agility.*I am a little surprised that the author, who is active in Japan, is off the mark.  I regularly talk to many engineers/entrepreneurs in the region, and the cause-and-effect are quite easy to see and are unanimously agreed upon.  Kudos to people there who are trying to change the software development culture for the better.* Elon's ventures seem to challenge this conventional dichotomy as he attempts to bring both agility and top-down leadership into his firms.  More power to him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent ~11 years in Japan, porting/building telecom protocol software and, more importantly, trying to build software development and business competence in our teams.  Sadly, although I had a reasonable impact on individual software engineers technical ability, I was unable to find any path to leverage that into "software business building" expertise.Of course, the attribution of causes to this is highly subjective and I expect every person to come away from the elephant with a different interpretation.In my case, the very, very top down 'age hierarchy' culture was (and continues unabated) to crush any ideas and proposals that come up from younger and more competent engineers.  In the last 30 years with Japan, I have met only a small handful of people that are willing to take input, let alone change direction, from someone younger than them.  (a trivial example was a fellow company director of mine that was born 5 _days_ earlier than me.  In 4 years working together, not once would he take anything I said seriously.   Hmm...)Give the number of excellent Japanese software engineers that I know, the burden of this "culture" is (to me) quite tragic on its impact slowing down national progress in an important global field.   If anyone as ideas how to get around this, I would love to know and learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's one more aspect to this that wasn't mentioned at all in the article.In Japan, home computers never really made sense until it was far, far too late.In the west, you'd buy a PC (or a home computer) to play games, edit documents or manage your business. The latter two were pretty much impossible in Japan, as the computers of that era couldn't handle the complexities of the Japanese language and character set. Gaming was all that remained, and if you only wanted gaming, you could just as well get a NES (known in Japan as Famicom), which was much better suited for the purpose.Computers eventually caught up, but some of the cultural impact remained, still making them less popular than in the west.This is one of the reasons why Japanese were so good at consumer electronics, they just needed that electronics a lot more than we did, and the devices needed a lot more features, as "just plug it into a computer to do the complicated stuff" wasn't really an option there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42077886</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the linked article:&gt; The method, in the form of an algorithm, takes in data that have been collected over time, such as the changing populations of different species in a marine environment. From those data, the method measures the interactions between every variable in a system and estimates the degree to which a change in one variable (say, the number of sardines in a region over time) can predict the state of another (such as the population of anchovy in the same region).I also read the introduction of the paper. Maybe I misunderstood something about causal inference, but I thought from data alone one could only infer correlations or associations (in general). To talk about "causal" links, I thought you need either to assume a particular model of the data generation process, or perform some interventions on the system to be able to decide the direction of the arrows in the "links" in general.I'm not saying that the paper is wrong or anything, it looks super useful! It's just that one should be careful when writing/reading the word "causal".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nature Communications paper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53373-4GitHub link: https://github.com/Computational-Turbulence-Group/SURD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12411&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055121</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "What I Wish Someone Told Me About Postgres" shares insights and advice for developers working with PostgreSQL, focusing on its powerful features and common pitfalls. It emphasizes the importance of understanding data types, indexing, and query optimization to improve database performance. The author also highlights the necessity of mastering CRUD operations and the advantages of employing advanced functionalities like JSONB for flexible data storage. Overall, the piece serves as a practical guide for efficiently utilizing PostgreSQL in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While postgres is indeed case sensitive usually writing queries with keywords in all caps is an effort to increase legibility for visual pattern matching.  It absolutely isn't needed but if I'm debugging a query of yours I will send it through my prettifier so that I can breeze through your definitions without getting hung up on minor weird syntax things.It's like prettification in any other language - visual structures that we can quickly recognize (like consistent indentation levels) make us waste less time on comprehension of the obvious so we can focus on what's important.The only thing I really object to is "actuallyUsingCaseInIdentifiers" I never want to see columns that require double quotes for me to inspect on cli.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d never stumbled across the “don’t do this” wiki entry[0] before. Very handy.[0] https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My number one tip:  Vacuum every day!I didn't know this when I started, so I never vacuumed the reddit databases.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But distinguishing between smaller brown dwarfs and planets requires looking at how they form. Even though they can end up about as massive as 10 Jupiters, planets always arise around a star, from its surrounding disk of gas and dust.&gt; In contrast, stars, including brown dwarfs, form on their own within giant collapsing clouds of gas.Is this really the standard terminology? It’s not how I remember it, and it doesn’t make much sense. There are tons of binary star systems, and while a some are three-body capture events, aren’t most formed from the same gas cloud? (I.e., not “on their own”.) Likewise, rogue planets (i.e., not bound to a star) can be formed in a stellar system and be ejected, but can’t they also form on their own, e.g., a dust cloud with less than enough total mass to form a star? Surely you wouldn’t call a sub-Jupiter-mass body a “brown dwarf” just because it formed in isolation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for pedantic remark, brown dwarfs is not stars, but they are substellar objects and formed in the similar fation (and this is why question about edge case of very large exoplanted vs very small brown dwarf is interestring)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substellar_object definition relies on sustained hydrogen fusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturn-size brown dwarfs?

&lt;p&gt;The HyperDX project is an open-source tool designed to enhance observability in software applications. It provides a system to collect, visualize, and analyze trace data, logs, and metrics in real-time. The v2 branch includes updates that improve performance and usability, enabling developers to understand their application's behavior better, troubleshoot issues more effectively, and optimize resource utilization. The repository offers comprehensive documentation for installation and integration, as well as examples demonstrating its capabilities in various environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whats hilarious is that Kibana started out as a Open Source.Hard to trust anything released as OSS these days that hits this site run by a for profit company.. Its all destined to have a rug pull after some VC funding. Considering HyperDX is a for profit company, I'm sure we won't have to wait long!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want an opensource / non AGPL licensed alternative for Kibana, Opensearch also includes a fork of Kibana in the form of Opensearch Dashboards.Clickhouse not being Elastic/Opensearch based means they would need to reinvent that wheel in any case because Kibana cannot use Clickhouse for storage. So this isn't so much an alternative but an essential component to make Clickhouse useful. Since you can't use Kibana for that. From various accounts here; they seem to have done a decent job.Of course the key strength of Kibana is that it builds on features that Elasticsearch has; like aggregations that are probably more limited in Clickhouse. Same with Opensearch Dashboards. It depends on your use case whether you actually need that of course.One point of concern with Clickhouse is that, like Elastic, they require contributors to sign contributor agreements. This basically allows them to re-license the code base if they want to at some point. Which is of course what Elastic did several times now (they changed it back to AGPL a few weeks back). Like Elastic are well funded by VC money but still pre-IPO. Just saying that if you moved to Clickhouse because of the Elastic licensing debacle, you might just have moved that problem instead of solving it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you clarify: Does the full-text search for logs linearly search all logs like Loki does, or can it speed it up with an index?The docs at https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/search don't seem to talk about this key design decision.I have a couple 100 GB to few TB logs (all from `journald` or JSON lines), just want to store them forever, and find results fast when searching for arbitrary substrings.Loki does not use an index, so it's pretty slow at finding results in TB-sized logs (does not return results within a few seconds, so it's not interactive).https://quickwit.io is one thing I'm looking at integrating, that can solve much of the index-based log search.(Note I'm not super familar with the capabilities of ClickHouse itself regarding indexed full-text search.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42117970</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the shortcomings of the edtech revolution, emphasizing that despite significant investment and innovation in educational technology, many solutions have not effectively addressed the fundamental issues in education. It critiques the reliance on technology as a panacea, arguing that it often overlooks the importance of pedagogy, teacher training, and the socio-emotional aspects of learning. The author calls for a reevaluation of how technology is integrated into education, proposing a more holistic approach that prioritizes student and educator needs over purely technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115597"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who's behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who's ahead can be nurtured.We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things "they shouldn't be" was just… insanely frustrating.Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's worked in EdTech for around two decades, I know why people think this. It's what a lot people here have already said. Education is what is failing, EdTech didn't magically solve this. Just like money, you can't just throw tech at education and expect it to solve anything.There are too many profitable incentives to poor education that are conspiring to perpetuate it. An ill-educated populace is easier to manipulate, gravitate towards consumerism, and won't hold their leaders as accountable. Power generally resides with those who benefit from an ill-educated populace, so anything that would actually help educate children and people at large is discouraged.I'll repeat what others have said here. Giving teachers the means with which to properly work with their students, and investing in students at a more individual level, is what's needed. Sadly, my refrain with regards to public education is that is has become little more than glorified babysitting. Those that succeed do so in spite of the system, and not because of it. Meanwhile, students that suffer from one or more disadvantagements (poverty, disability, social issues, mental or physical health issues, and so much more) tend to just...suffer more. And then they fall into cycles where preventable issues repeat or enhance into the next generation. They'll still spend all of their little income excessively, so profit is still to be had, or they'll end-up in prison, which, again, thanks to privatization, is also immensely profitable, so no problem there, right?The system is setup to fail because that's what's profitable in the long run for those seeking such profits. And because they can lobby, and use their wealth to influence politics, it won't change. Something else needs to happen first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The teaching method I find best is a teacher explaining and writing with chalk on the blackboard, and the students taking handwritten notes on paper, asking whenever something is not clear. In other words, the most boring classical setup possible. Of course all the nuances and little details make all the difference: board picture, structure, teacher personality, pacing, choice of topic, interaction, motivation, excitement, etc..  It is not guaranteed to work, but as a format it is workable, and I found nothing so far that is better either as a student (long time ago) or as a prof at a top university (for some time now).A distant second is the format we used during COVID: writing with a tablet using xournal, and streaming it via zoom (loosely like Khan academy). This is of course only my personal experience/opinion, but also informed by vast amounts of student feedback.EDIT: I agree with the different perspectives from the responses, and should have qualified that I meant it for subjects one typically learns at a university, like calculus or linear algebra. One-on-one tutoring, self-learning can work even better or complement the above and skills, e.g. playing a musical instrument should be approached totally differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115597</guid></item><item><title>28.

We will do what we can to rescue you, and the skill of some of the Rat's pilots is second to none.  (I won't claim that of myself.  But one of The Rats usually holds the Bubble -&gt; Colonia speed record.)The number of stories you end up with ratting is amazing... it is a wonderful thing to do.  Especially when you have it all in Elite.  Why not help others.  Rescue can pretty challenging.  And losing a rescue... really sucks :(  (Code Reds - They are out of fuel, and on O2.)"We've got fuel, you don't. Any questions?" - The Fuel Rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I ended up in a system with a star I couldn't refuel from and was S.O.L. I had vaguely heard of the Fuel Rats[0] and did a google to see if they were real and contactable. I put in a call to them and about an hour later a kindly pilot turned up, refuelled me and off I went with a warm fuzzy feeling. I was very grateful. It reminded me of happy times being in a corp in Eve with your comrades helping each other out.Being reminded of this might make me give Elite another go.[0]: https://fuelrats.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I had known about this when I gave up on the game. After a really frustrating time trying to figure out how to progress in the game, I was given bad advice to buy some contraband alcohol in one system with the last of my money and try to sell it in another. It was advertised as a sure thing. It was not, as the contraband was confiscated (I should have seen this coming). I couldn’t find anything to do or any way to make money, so I tried to make it to the next closest station. Ran out of fuel in the middle of literally nowhere, shut down the game and uninstalled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112005</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of using image montages as a form of resistor networks to explore dynamic range transformation in visual data. It explains how image montages can represent complex relationships through a series of interconnected components, analogous to how resistors operate within an electrical circuit. By visualizing images as networks, the author highlights potential applications in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and artistic expression, emphasizing the innovative merging of visual and mathematical techniques to generate new insights and creative outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So these addition formulas that apply to series and parallel resistors seem more generally to be formulas for finding the new ratio when you have several ratios and want to add them together treating the quantity in the numerator or the denominator as equal for all ratios. Series circuits have the same current for each ratio, and differing voltages, while parallel circuits have the same voltage for each ratio and a different current for each. Similarly for these aspect ratios, where you want the new ratio after adding width or height while setting the other (height or width, respectively) equal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is neat!When I was fresh out of uni, I got asked to build a system to show recommendations to people based on a graph of connections between them. I tried to mentally think about these as a network of resistors, which led me to dimensionality reduction and from there to alternating least squares. Isomorphisms are fun like that: they can help you find techniques when you're stuck on something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you made the Piet painting from a substrate with constant resistivity, and put wires between each area, you would end up with a working circuit with all the calculated resistances.  This then leads to the insight that it doesn't matter how you divide the painting up, its total resistance only depends on its overall size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115072</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some recordings on the website are RealMedia. I thought most players supported that but apparently quite a few don’t! So if nothing else works for you, try ffplay.(Curiously enough, Celluloid seems to play this and Haruna doesn’t, although both are wrappers for mpv.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone interested, the earliest sound recorded is from 1860, and isn't from Edison, but from a Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, on a machine he called the "Phonoautograph". The machine recorded "traces" which a team at Stanford managed to convert back into sounds in 2008: https://www.archeophone.com/artists/s/edouard-leon-scott-de-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a different era, but still early in recorded history, you may enjoy the Excavated Shellac collection (https://excavatedshellac.com/) by Jonathan Ward.Please share other collections if you know of any!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111109</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When people find out I use jj (Jujutsu), I often get asked some version of "how's it better than Git?" And while I can list a number of reasons why I think it's better and you could argue whether or not that reason is contrived or not, I think it's all missing the point.I think it's better -- in the most pessimistic case -- to look at jj as reframing how you think about branches and commits in the same way that learning a type of Lisp reframes your thinking even if you're a full time Python developer and have zero intention of ever using a Lisp.The idea of shuffling commits around without fear, changing your working train of thought mid-branch, etc. is natural... mindless, even. It's one command away and you get so much muscle memory executing that command you just do it automatically. (There's no fear because `jj undo` undoes any operation you did if you regret it. Of course there a ways to undo N operations back and so on too).I use jj full time now, but even when I periodically go back to using git (for older projects I don't have a jj clone out for), it has altered the way I look at my stream of work. I think there's value in that.That's the pessimistic case. The optimistic case is you should be using jj because it's better and there's almost zero downside to doing it (your coworkers don't even need to know).(This blog post was great, I just expect and already see some people focusing on the minutia of how to Git golf your way to achieving the same thing easily when that doesn't invalidate that jj is good, in my opinion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; git really forces me to make a lot of decisions I don’t actually care about. How will I save my WIP while I’m off on this quest? Do I want to juggle stashes and my working tree, or throw commits around? How will I get a commit where I want it? Do I need to come up with a branch name? And how much of all this needs to just sit in my head or pasteboard, lest I forget what I was in the middle of?I am hearing this argument a lot, but I don't really get it. My grocery store forces me to make a lot of decision when it offers me 7 kinds of ketchup and 20+ kinds of cereal, but no one says "I am avoiding large grocery stores because they force me to make too many decisions". If you are feeling adventurous, try something new. If you just want to get some food and go, grab your favorite brands. And yes, a smaller store won't force you to choose, but there is good chance you won't like the food you buy there.(For the problem described, I'd do as following: Save WIP work as temporary commit. No, you don't want to juggle stashes. You can do interactive rebase with "edit" mode and then cherry-pick extra commit - this'll let you make sure test passes after rebase too. Yes, you need to come up with branch name, any will go, like c_s_test. You will need to keep the name of previous branch in your head, but given author uses "develop" it should not be too bad. But this is all my preferences, if someone wants to do something else - more power to them.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why won't this work to achieve the exact same thing?  # on branch `feature`
  # code code code
  # whoops! Test missing
  git add wip/ changes/ &amp;&amp; git commit -m lol
  git checkout develop
  # write the test
  git add test/ files/ &amp;&amp; git commit -m lol2
  # back to WIP branch
  git checkout feature
  # open vim and put the lol2 commit in the right place
  git rebase -i develop
  ?lol2&lt;cr&gt;dd/3e7&lt;cr&gt;P:wq
  # undo the original lol commit
  git reset HEAD~1
 
You could use git stash instead of making and resetting the `lol` commit but i just prefer to do it this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111597</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Blame the Gerbils" by Tom Shippey discusses the intersection of language, literature, and cultural history, particularly focusing on the significance of gerbils in popular culture and literature. Shippey explores how these small animals have been anthropomorphized in various narratives, reflecting broader themes of human behavior and societal norms. He delves into the implications of attributing blame to these creatures in a humorous and thought-provoking manner, ultimately examining how such representations can shed light on human nature and our relationship with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;England did not return to its pre-plague population until about 1625, 280 years after the first strike. During most of that period Western Europe had about half the population it had in 1345. And yet 1400-1500 ‘is the very century in which Western Europe’s global expansion began’, the period of what has been called ‘the Great Divergence’ between Europe and the rest of the world. ‘The Black Death and the Rise of Europe’, as Belich’s subtitle has it, do seem to be linked in time, and it may not be a coincidence.This period also coincided with the renaissance and the European wars of religion. Europe was a busy place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/4YwT6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading this, "Celebrating the Gerbils" may be a more apt title. He is "blaming" them for the rise of Europe via the after effects of the transmission of a terrible disease. It is a sort of justification for the policy positions of a recent Marvel villain.  Gamora : I was a child when you took me.
  Thanos : I saved you.
  Gamora : No. We were happy on my home planet.
  Thanos : You were going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
  Gamora : Because you murdered half the planet.
  Thanos : A small price to pay for salvation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112864</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the extraordinary story of the Lykov family, who retreated to the remote Siberian wilderness in the 1930s to escape modern society and its influences. Living in isolation for 40 years, they were oblivious to significant historical events such as World War II and the moon landing. Their way of life was heavily influenced by their deep-rooted religious beliefs and self-sufficiency, relying on agriculture and foraging. The family's isolation ended when they were discovered by a group of geologists in 1978, which revealed the challenges and complexities of their existence in the wild and their eventual struggles to adapt to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very Russian story: must-have big drama, old grudges, extreme distances  and overwhelming sadness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the family found out about satellites is very interesting to me- such an unexplained phenomena wouldn't make sense to some groups (ie, flat-earthers deny their existence altogether), where they would have observed Sputnik zooming across the sky while only being visible at dawn and dusk. With such perfect recurrence the Lykovs would have been able to deduce that the object followed ordinary orbital mechanics against the backdrop of the celestial cosmos rather than being a supernatural object, especially that Sputnik was only in the sky for a couple months in 1957. Later ones would have have likely indicated they were a product of man; I'd personally ascribe it to being supernatural in origin!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is their homesite on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/CkPRPxPuQuCg3q749Seems to be sort of a tourist attraction now. The nearest road is about 55 miles away according to the measuring tool on google maps. There's several nature preserves/parks in the area that protect the site. I guess people hike to it now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119219</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Carving Space" by Heather Buchel explores the importance of creating personal space for self-reflection and growth. Buchel discusses the significance of stepping back from everyday demands to cultivate a nurturing environment for oneself. She shares insights on how intentional space can enhance creativity, mental clarity, and emotional well-being. The piece emphasizes the need for individuals to prioritize their own needs and make time for solitude, ensuring that they can better engage with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I expected frontend devs to be able to handle the front-of and back-of equally well, but it sounds like that's very rarely the case. Are people that fall into this camp more likely to be at design-led companies, like Apple?Also, does anyone have resource recommendations for a frontend engineer to get better at these things? I've built up some solid intuition after working closely with a designer, but my big hurdle has been feeling like I need to dive deep into design world, get good at Figma, etc. Reading about the theory/concepts makes sense, but putting it into practice is what I feel will make it really stick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to engage in the discussion the article raises about why teams don't hire for this role.So, I have actually tried to hire for this role. Multiple times.The reality is that I got an order of magnitude fewer applications of an order of magnitude lower quality when I've tried to describe this role, as compared to when I just put the standardized "front end engineer" title in the role.So instead I tried to just sift through the "front end engineer" applicants to find people with design sensibilities. But this also yielded poor results. After reviewing at least a thousand applicants, I found one or two people with this combination of skillsets, and one of them to whom I made an offer ended up going with a different firm.Senior engineers in our team said things like "I think you're searching for a unicorn that doesn't exist" and "people just don't mix the right-brained and left-brained skills."After trying so hard, I just accepted that and decided to work with dedicated designers and dedicated engineers. Each are good at what they do.But our web experience is definitely lacking for lack of someone in this role. Right now, this week, I'm trying to fill the gap as I can do a little bit of both. Everyone on our team feels like we need some "glue" to tie our experiences together well. But a designer can't make it happen and a pure engineer can't imagine what to do without very explicit detailed designs / instructions. It's so much more effective for one person to at once understand how the code needs to function, what helps the user, and have design sensibility to make the form 'function' w/r/t cognitive overload and intuition. Things get lost in communication without someone who can understand all three. But there's no one I feel I can truly delegate this to completely on our product team.What have the experiences been of other people who have hired and built product teams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120313</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the unique ecological impact of feral pigs on the islands of the Pacific, particularly focusing on their invasive nature and the challenges they present to native wildlife and habitats. It discusses how these pigs, originally brought by humans, have adapted to island life and their role in altering ecosystems, which can lead to negative consequences for indigenous species. The piece highlights conservation efforts and the complexities of managing this feral population while balancing environmental and cultural considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bass heavy tendency of western consumer grade headphones/speakers is tuned for western pop music and does not sound very good with much else, some of the non-western pop traditions are not bad. Headphones/speakers with a flat response will sound lacking in bass but will not sound piercing with sources which were not mixed with bass heavy systems in mind and will play better with EQ. While flat may lack the deep powerful bass you will get used to it and you will be able to hear everything else in the track better, including the bass.The way they get that deep powerful bass is not just by increasing the bass, that would leave everything outside of the bass too quite in comparison, they also put dips in the frequency response to accentuate the bass. These dips work fairly well as long as the instruments are fairly consistent in their ranges which is quite regular in western pop, everything is essential a bass, a guitar and vocals even when they are not and you have 10 instruments in the mix, everyone sticks to the various ranges which sound right and the engineer (assuming they are good) fudges things with the mixing. But the dips come at a cost, you lose detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is very out of date and irrelevant now. The Chi-fi market has changed drastically in the last 4 years. You can get very neutral sounding IEMs from China now, V-shaped, U-shaped, sparkly, heavy bass, etc.One of the best-sounding, lowest distortion I've tried is also the cheapest, the Truthear Zero 2, available on Amazon for $25.If you're interested in scientific measurements of the IEM, AudioScienceReview has it covered: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/7...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you have ever heard Mainland Chinese recordings dated back 30-40 years ago, they were shouty, harsh and ear-piercing (plenty examples on YouTube).Sounds interesting, but I don't know what search terms to use. Does anyone have any representative examples?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42031384</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how firmware hacks are revitalizing Spotify's Car Thing, a device that helps users access the Spotify app in their vehicles. Despite the device's eventual decline in official support and looming obsolescence from Spotify, enthusiastic developers have created unofficial software modifications that enhance its functionality. This has reignited interest in the product among users who appreciate these improvements, showcasing a trend where hacking can prolong the life of tech devices that companies may discontinue. The article also emphasizes the ongoing community efforts to keep such technology relevant despite corporate decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! I'm a college freshman at Northeastern, and this is my first hackathon project for a major hackathon (MIT Media Lab). It won the Unconventional Computing track prize, so I'm pretty happy! I made this because I'm a major conlanger, and I was wondering if it would be possible to think in terms of sound when looking at an image. Fractals have easy-to-map parameters, so I created SHFLA, a language which takes in music, and creates fractals based on 0.1 second (you can change this) chunks of music! It's Turing-complete, so you can technically encode a ridiculous amount of information and computation in my system, although writing it out as music might take a while.Hope you find the project cool :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The concept reminded me of the song Lateralus by Tool, where geometric fractals are a theme.https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7JG63IuaWshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralushttps://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-tools-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not understanding what this has to do with shoegaze.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I must be one of those tiny dots just floating in nothingness because my BSKY feed is a dead zone.  I've posted, I've replied, I've liked and tried to be an active participant but nothing seems to stick.  There's only so many posts I can publish "for myself" before I lose interest.Contrast this with early Twitter where everyone was just super excited, and eager to follow new people.  I don't get it, shouldn't a new social network be full of people looking to create new... social networks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky and atproto seem to be built to be hackable.Someone in the community recently built a searchable directory of Bluesky "Starter Packs" (which are a way for a user to publish a set of interesting people &amp; feeds to follow, primarily to help newcomers bootstrap their experience):https://blueskydirectory.com/starter-packs/allDan Abramov posted about it earlier today, saying he liked it and:"the fact that it can be done in the ecosystem is awesome. let the ecosystem cook" [1]And maybe more poignantly:"seeing random projects pop up in the atproto ecosystem reminds me just how much public web common were stifled by social companies closing down their APIs. an entire landscape of tools given up on and abandoned" [2][1] https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3lar3sdna222d[2] https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3lar3xpuu4c2d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky has really exploded in certain niches over the past week, I think my followers have gone up 5-6x since Saturday.I'd been a somewhat active user over the past year as conversation on the field I work in (energy) become so degraded on Twitter as to make it kind of worthless (mean in multiple senses of the word as well as ludicrous levels of spam), but Bluesky was pretty relaxed without a lot of traction, now there's some real heat to it as things pick up.Hopefully this surge is real, has certianly gotten me to be much more active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118180</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting choice with telegram. I see it requires to get user's own Gmail api credentials?I too recently launched AI automations for Gmail. I am a heavy email user, so connecting chatgpt to my inbox was obvious to me. When gpt-4 was released it passed my tests with 90% accuracy, so I've decided to release it at inboxchat.aiBut while I enjoy AI sorting my emails, the most useful feature for meturned out to be screener, inspired by this post: https://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2018/Sep/solving-my-email-probl.... It sends all emails from first-time or unknown senders into a separate Review Later label. If email is moved to Inbox, then that sender becomes trusted and is allowed into Inbox in the future. It's simple, dumb feature but so effective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use https://emailzap.co/reclaim-your-inbox. Simplest and most effective tool I have found so far. Alerts me for first time senders and if I don't take any action, it understands that future emails from such senders shouldn't come to my inbox. Auto-archives temporary emails like OTPs, etc. Best part is that it does all that without you having to provide any input to it. Only grudge is that it doesn't auto move emails to my labels but I am hoping they add that feature soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Telegram seems like strange choice but ok. I personally started to tinker with something similar - IMAP client which learns how you categorize emails into folders and helps with that. I started with manual rules and want to connect some optional automagic later.I noticed that some emails are valid for only some hours and then it's in inbox unnecessarily giving that +1 to unread badge.On other hand server side filtering works before arriving in inbox so you don't see for example, that parcel will arrive today. Next day you need to manually archive it. After 10-20 mails like that, if you are busy - half of inbox needlessly needs user action if you are into inbox zero.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118989</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;Spanish police have arrested a former fraud chief after discovering €20 million hidden in the walls of his home. The large sum, reportedly in cash and neatly packed into bags, was uncovered during a raid linked to a separate investigative operation focused on corruption and money laundering. Authorities are investigating how the money was acquired and the role the former official played in the fraudulent activities. This incident highlights ongoing efforts by Spanish law enforcement to combat corruption in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does one even expect to use €20M of physical paper cash? You're going to get scrutiny from the government and/or financial institutions if you try to deposit it into a bank.  I guess you'd "launder" it somehow, but does that even work anymore? Major purchases with cash put a giant government bullseye on your back these days. That is if you could actually make those purchases. I'd imagine most major purchases that someone legitimate might make (like buying a house or a car or a private jet) cannot be done with physical cash. Does the local Mercedes dealership really accept a suitcase full of cash? Even if you were to use it for all of your normal routine spending like groceries, you'd never go through €20M in your entire lifetime. So, career-fraudsters, I ask: in case I ever get my hands on millions in cash, what is my plan for using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You keep calling someone a "Fraud Chief" long enough...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd forgotten Europe has €500 notes, whereas in the US everyone now gets to deal with $100 bill spam.Few people bother to pickup loose change anymore.What's the long-term plan here?  Perhaps it's to add maximum physical friction to moving larger amounts of fiat than you can spend in a single visit to Costco on a food run for your family of of 4.:)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119575</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Learning Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection via Uncertainty Calibration Using Label Smoothing" discusses a novel approach to improve out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. The authors propose a method that employs label smoothing to enhance uncertainty calibration, thereby allowing models to better identify instances that differ significantly from the training distribution. The research presents experiments demonstrating that the proposed technique outperforms existing OOD detection methods in various scenarios, emphasizing its effectiveness in practical applications of machine learning where recognizing unfamiliar data is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the history and evolution of playing cards, tracing their origins from ancient China and Persia to their modern forms. It details how playing cards spread across Europe in the late 14th century, leading to the establishment of various suits and designs. The article highlights significant developments in materials and printing techniques, such as the introduction of the two-color printing method in the 19th century. Additionally, it discusses the rise of collectible card games and the cultural significance of playing cards throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deck of playing cards has to have one of the highest density of "usefulness" an object can have that I can think of. I would love to hear if anyone can think of any one thing nearly as useful in so many ways.Entertainment of course - single and multiplayer, chance and betting, mathematics of all kinds, throwing, building (like a house of cards). I thought it was so cool when a character in Cryptonomicon used it to create an encryption cypher from jail.A sufficiently randomly shuffled deck of cards is almost certainly in an arrangement that has never existed before and will ever exist again.52 cards divides evenly by 2, 4, 13, 26. Add two jokers and you get 3, 6, 9, 18. Remove the faces and you get even more.Its just so well designed - or evolved as it were. If you could only have one object for the rest of your life to entertain or educate you, I dont think you could do much better than a deck of cards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never knew that “Kings being King David (Spades), Alexander the Great (Clubs), Charlemagne (Hearts), and Julius Caesar (Diamonds), representing the four empires of Jews, Greeks, Franks, and Romans. Notable characters ascribed to the Queens include the Greek goddess Pallas Athena (Spades), Judith (Hearts), Jacob's wife Rachel (Diamonds), and Argine (Clubs). The Knaves were commonly designated as La Hire (Hearts), Charlemagne’s knight Ogier (Spades), Hector the hero of Troy (Diamonds), and King Arthur's knight Lancelot (Clubs).”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article triggered Gell Mann Amnesia very quickly when it suggested playing cards may have evolved from Mah Jongg tiles. Mah Jongg was invented in the mid 1800s and spread during the Taiping Rebellion. Chinese society has Middle Ages origin gambling cards, but Mah Jongg tiles are very far removed from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036242</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related discussion, 7 days ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42057139&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I may be wrong, but I disagree with a lot of the spin being pushed in this article, although of course Hinton deserves a lot of the credit for keeping the field alive and igniting the "deep learning" explosion.- The ImageNet dataset / competition pre-dates neural net entrants, and I'm not aware that Fei Fei created it in anticipation of such. The reason that AlexNet (2012 ILSVRC/ImageNet entry) made such an impact was that it beat all non-ANN entrants by such a huge margin that it was impossible to ignore, and pretty much killed all ongoing attempts to hand-design transform-invariant image features (such as SIFT).- While NVidia deserve credit for enabling GPU-compute with CUDA, it was pure luck that ANNs subsequently took off, and became the primary use of CUDA (which then added ANN specific libraries such as cuDNN).- AlexNet (ImageNet 2012) was certainly what started the ANN boom, which Hinton/LeCun/Bengio then decided to re-brand as "deep learning" to escape any historically negative association of "neural networks". However, while AlexNet demonstrated the power of a large (&amp; deep) neural net, I don't think it's fair to say that it was responsible the current/waning belief in LLM "scaling laws". The immediate aftermath of AlexNet wasn't bigger datasets, but attempts to build bigger/better ANNs to do better on the ImageNet benchmark. The LLM "scaling laws" originated from OpenAI's GPT-1 and GPT-2 where unexpected model capabilities lead to experimentation of scaling, with Sutskever and Amodei being two of the earliest believers. Sutskever has recently said that he thinks that transformer scaling has plateaued, and has started his own company (SSI) pursuing a different approach.I don't think we can say that Hinton accidentally created the deep learning boom. He always (to his huge credit) believed in ANNs, pushed it into the public eye with AlexNet, created the "Deep Learning" branding, and generally promoted it until it got too powerful for his liking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Huang argued that the simple existence of CUDA would enlarge the supercomputing sector. This view was not widely held, and by the end of 2008, Nvidia’s stock price had declined by seventy percent…This is a good example of how investor behaviour can only quantitatively project what will happen in the future. Huang's bet on GPUs for high performance computing made sense in the long term.Intel didn't have the staying power with the i860[1] a decade earlier (and of course had no idea how to offer decent developer tools). I tried really hard to develop meaningful and executable programmes with an 8bit card (DSM). CUDA was a revelation for me.[1] https://www.geekdot.com/intel-80860/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42116140</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Research from MIT reveals that exercise not only strengthens muscles but also promotes the growth of neurons in the brain. The study identifies a protein called FNDC5, produced during muscle contractions, that stimulates the formation of new neurons. This finding suggests that physical activity could play a vital role in enhancing brain health and potentially combating neurological diseases by encouraging neurogenesis, the process of generating new neurons. The insights from this research highlight the interconnected benefits of physical fitness for both muscular and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarification since a number of the comments are reading this as "strength training makes your brain stronger". This study looked at _motor_ neurons, not neurons in your brain. Motor neurons are the neurons between your spinal cord and muscle cells, responsible for transferring the signal from your brain to contract/relax your muscles.I think it was already known that working out muscles increases the innervation (the resolution of how many neurons are attached to a muscle) of the muscles, which is the mechanism for increased motor control that eg pianists have. I think this study is shedding more light on process, and providing stronger empirical evidence for that exact mechanism. Very exciting that this might be used to help people recover from nerve damage/spinal cord injury!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscles need neurons to control them, so it makes sense that some feedback loop would exist. I remember reading about similar feedback loops between muscle growth and bone density (as you get stronger, bones benefit from being resilient to higher loads).As I understand it, the kinetic chain goes nervous system -&gt; muscles -&gt; tendons -&gt; bones. It would make sense for all of these to make each other stronger in some way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two things that will improve mental clarity and sleep. Not drinking alcohol and strength training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115515</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the psychological and social factors that contribute to human tendencies toward corruption. It discusses how scientific research reveals underlying motivations, including the influence of environment, personal incentives, and social norms, in fostering corrupt behaviors. Additionally, it examines the complex relationship between power and corruption, highlighting that individuals in positions of authority may be more prone to unethical actions. The piece emphasizes the need for understanding these dynamics to create strategies for reducing corruption in various spheres of society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article hints at, but doesn't fully dive into, the perspective of personal ethics. Many people who would never steal money from an individual would happily steal money from the government. As humans we tend to view these acts very differently.Relatedly, such people are more likely to steal money from a government they see as evil/corrupt, than a government they see as good. This probably drives a large part of the "contextual" corruption effect the article discusses, where a non-corrupt individual starts working for a corrupt government and suddenly becomes corrupt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So corruption is cultural.I'm a European currently living in Mexico and this has always been obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All human moral behavior straddles the line betweeen selflessness and selfishness, at some particular scale, from the personal to the societal/cultural.Racism? Selfishness for the group.
Religious bigotry? Selfishness for the group.
Misogyny? Need I say?
Corruption? Selfishness for one's personal gain at the expense of the system, itself.Goodness? Virtue? Honor? Positive cultural evolution? Selflessness in service to the whole.That is why the world has been tending towards the negative for soooo long. We have been inculcated into belief systems that separate us from each other along some boundary, be it cultural, racial, religious, gender identification, sexual preference, country, neighborhood, ... whatever.We are all one human race, of many ethnicities and cultures, but we will only begin to heal our blessed Earth and end all conflict, by recognizing that we are the only creatures capable of self-evolving a world culture of universal care.The goal must be universal compassion towards one another, selflessly, except when such kind, selfless behavior would contradict the paradox of tolerance. In those instances, we must be unyielding, but as gentle as good outcomes allow. Only a compassionate society can know how and when to prosecute the vermin among us, who come from all walks of life. We must endeavor to teach the ignorant, while protecting the innocent.Just systems of law, enforced fairly, are the bedrock of such a society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42114852</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how these sort of solutions come up. I never understood the tab problem, I don't even use extensions to manage tabs, group tabs, or whatever. I like to keep my work focused, so apart from the 4-5 tabs I keep permanently open due to convenience (email, tasks, calendar, etc), I rarely have more than 3-4 others of stuff I'm working/researching. When its done, I close them. If I need them, I either bookmark or save the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do work in physics research so I open on average 20-30 arxiv and research papers per any session. This is combined with the usual searches for SO and docs (looking at you CUDA docs) which would be a lot of tabs for any gives session.I used Firefox developer edition (it was better performance that vanilla Firefox for my m1 mac and this is just a feeling not backed up with any data) and now is using zen browser. It is a huge upgrade, now I have workspaces, split tabs and vertical tabs. All while still using Firefox and ublock origin.I think this made tabs management good experience but ths most important factor is that I trained myself to really hate having tabs that I don't know which means that once I get past 10 tabs that browser starts to hide some information I got annoyed and then go close some.But I really feel like zen browser is everything I want in a browser so far. I tried arc which is close but it is chromium based and it is resource monster and also closed source and required account to use.One other useful thing is that once I got used to use my selfhosted linkding to actually bookmark things I want to explore, this helped with the tendency to use open tabs as things to read later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can achieve the exact same thing in Firefox using the Sidebery extension: https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112475</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe ten years ago, I read a blog post by, I think, a French company called snips, that explained how their app used the pressure sensor to detect when the train entered or leaved a station. It turned out there was a very clear signal due to the sudden pressure increase or decrease when the train entered or left the tunnel between the stations.Edit: found it. https://medium.com/snips-ai/underground-location-tracking-3e...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is SO cool.I am actually currently working on a project to record the sound of the London Underground passing under me.We can very clearly hear the Northern Line under us. It's &lt; 30 meters below us.I have become obsessed with getting high-quality, low frequency recordings of it passing under us.Why? I don't know. I just can't take my mind off it.For example, there are two tunnels (north and south bound). By correlating it with actual TfL data, can I figure out the sound signature of each?More intriguingly, I know that there are maintenance vehicles that operate under us in off hours. Can I "catch" them?I'm not sure what else I might do with this project, but the idea of capturing the sound of this semi-ephemeral creature that operates below me has captivated me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we take a moment to appreciate the engaging, conversational tone of the writing? The article was a pleasure to read, even when it gets into some weeds explaining the frequency charts, etc. (I read the English-language version).Whoever wrote this did a fantastic job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122085</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I implemented something similar to the compositional regular expressions feature described here for JavaScript a while ago (independently, so semantics may not be the same), and it is one of the libraries I find myself most often bringing into other projects years later. It gets you a tiny bit closer to feeling like you have a first-class parser in the language. Here is an example of implementing media type parsing with regexes using it: https://runkit.com/tolmasky/media-type-parsing-with-template..."templated-regular-expression" on npm, GitHub: https://github.com/tolmasky/templated-regular-expressionTo be clear, programming languages should just have actual parsers and you shouldn't use regular expressions for parsers. But if you ARE going to use a regular expression, man is it nice to break it up into smaller pieces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Sign me up for leaving the industry before I ever have to maintain a Raku codebase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speed is still a major issue with Raku. Parsing a log file with a regex is Perl's forte but the latest Raku still takes 6.5 times as long as Python 3.13 excluding startup time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120090</guid></item><item><title>3. 3600 MHz Raspberry Pi 5 with Liquid Nitrogen</title><link>https://skatterbencher.com/2024/11/11/3600-mhz-raspberry-pi-5-with-liquid-nitrogen/</link><description>

It was basically and advertisement for Elmor Labs and everything was “swap out a part for an Elmor part configured to do the same thing”.The cooling was basically for show given the temperature- and voltage-independent scaling wall; the proper place to go would have been an ARM-based development house to use the debug tools, they’re certainly available.I’m not a Pi guy and I don’t know if the dev samples/hal/device trees have been released yet, but another option is to set up a bare metal environment and bring up the clock buses one by one to a different multiplier and see if you can reproduce it manually executing neon instructions in a tight loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Coming from Ubuntu in my SkatterBencher guide, there’s two things we can improve:&gt; 1.   Change to the official Raspberry Pi OSNow I'm curious how much OS matters.

There's just so many resources to learn from these days on youtube which didn't exist 5-10 years ago and I guarantee you if you have the time for it you can go from downloading renoise and a bunch of samples to bumping out some songs within a week or two of learning. There's also a lot to be said for the kind of sound you get out of older hardware, you have kids who are like 20 years old picking up these things and doing shit like emulating the DSP in there to create a VST for use on modern systems for those who don't want to drop a bunch of money on getting an amiga 500 shipped to their door [1], but you also have people pretty much just doing that and busting out octamed or protracker.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There were several motivations behind the spiral. The first was an interest in the spiral patterns of both Celtic and Islamic art, and a desire to create a similar effect with as few rules as possible"Quasi-periodic Islamic wall tilings are a whole interesting black hole, e.g. see this paper https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1135491This really resonates with me. Unfortunately "the two cultures" polarizes people into viewing artists as airheads doing random artifacts or mathematicians as weirdos working on mostly useless stuff - the "I'm bad at math" confession to bond with people is common.How can we encourage more people to study both art &amp; math? Or Humanities and Science in general, e.g. English and Biology?I've always fantasized about having $10M discretionary money (haven't done the math, really, just a random figure) and opening a "Arts and Sciences Academy", which would be a high school where Arts trivium (music, literature, sculpture) would be studied on equal footing and intertwined with Sciences trivium (math, physics, biology) - I know an eclectic mix.I don't know why the very rich not pursue setting up schools like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fellow mathematical sculptor is Carlo Séquin [0].

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaguely related anecdote:30 years ago or so I worked at a tiny networking company where several coworkers came from a small company (call it C) that made AppleTalk routers. They recounted being puzzled that their competitor (company S) had a reputation for having a rock-solid product, but when they got it into the lab they found their competitor's product crashed maybe 10 times more often than their own.It turned out that the competing device could reboot faster than the end-to-end connection timeout in the higher-level protocol, so in practice failures were invisible. Their router, on the other hand, took long enough to reboot that your print job or file server copy would fail. It was as simple as that, and in practice the other product was rock-solid and theirs wasn't.(This is a fairly accurate summary of what I was told, but there's a chance my coworkers were totally wrong. The conclusion still stands, I think - fast restarts can save your ass.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My workplace currently has a similar problem where a resource leak can be greatly increased with certain unpredictable/unknown traffic conditions.Our half-day workaround implementation was the same thing, just cycle the cluster regularly automatically.Since we're running on AWS, we just double the size of the cluster, wait for the instances to initialize, then rapidly decommission the old instances. Every 2 hours.It's shockingly stable. So much so that resolving the root cause isn't considered a priority and so we've had this running for months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's neat is that this is a differential equation. If you kill 5% of instances each hour, the reduction in bad instances is proportional to the current number of instances.i.e.if bad(t) = fraction of bad instances at time tandbad(0) = 0thend(bad(t))/dt = -0.05 * bad(t) + 0.01 * (1 - bad(t))sobad(t) = 0.166667 - 0.166667 e^(-0.06 t)Which looks a mighty lot like the graph of bad instances in the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42087275</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ha, this reminds me of a very similar practice I used to engage in with a few buddies when we started work. It was always fun to try to figure out how to optimize the PTO to get the “most days per day”.Nowadays, I find that the best time to take PTO is when I feel like taking PTO. Taking a long weekend when I’m feeling burnt out or disengaged goes much further for me than grinding for the entire first half of th year to get a week off for 4th of July. YMMV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats ! However I feel the claim is lying to me and inconsistant:« In […], there are 11 public holidays in 2024.Let's stretch your time off from 25 days to 61 days »61 actually adds up my time off (25) with adjacent week ends and public holidays (27).  The 9 missing are week ends already next to public holliday but without any proposed time off extension. If you’re gonna count the WE next to PU it would be fair to include them in the initial count.The inconsistency is that I didn’t count one Saturday next to a public Holliday in Sunday, while the +9 I’m referring above are Friday/Monday next to week ends.I know this does not make your product less useful, but in a psychological perspective it toggle my defence mode instantly [0] in the same way an over promising advertisement as the opposite effect than expected.0: discussion ongoing here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113449&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I typically try to take annual leave and to travel exactly on the opposite dates to what this tool recommends. That's because I care more about avoiding the significant extra expense, traffic, and crowds of travel over public holiday periods, than I do about getting a few extra "free days" of leave. No free lunch!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118039</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO, an even better tool was the Cube 2 Sauerbraten ingame editor - a combination of octree(e.g. variable-size) voxels spliced with per-vertex heightmaps that let you treat parts of it as terrain, others as cubes, and sculpt others into arches, rocks, spheres or vases.It had that same intuitive sculpting feel, but even more powerful and quick to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the quake .map format. It is like this glimpse into an weird alternate history. A sort steampunk ascetic to graphics.The article touches on this, but for them unfamiliar, the quake .map format is the editable text based format. but it does not use the common method of vertices into edges into faces as the base building block. it uses planes, the graphics primitive is is the three points that define a plane, where these planes intersect are the edges.I never dove into the subject enough to figure out if this plane representation was also internal to the compiled bsp format, but I suspect it is. My guess is that it is the natural conclusion when you need a map interchange format for your highly optimized space partitioned engine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;beautiful to see a decent programmer understanding the tech that people at e.g. unity and unreal have just fucked up badly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121957</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just finished my own overthinking of recipe structures.  
I figure that a recipe is more or less an upside-down tree!Where you start with a list of all the nodes (ingredients)Have a n:1 relationship with the next series of nodes (steps)until you finish at a single node (the dish you're trying to make)So instead of having a separate chunk of "here's my ingredients" and "let me repeat the ingredients and one by one instruction until the end" I figure you can display the upside-down tree to convey more information with less words.An example being https://cookbook.cstebbins.com/recipe/bul-kokiWith the underlying tree structure looking like https://assets.cstebbins.com/cookbook/images/bulkokiTree.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find "higher level" format issues to be of greater concern. These are issues like: is the recipe structured in a way that makes the prep/process flow clear, makes it obvious when a certain ingredient needs to be prepped but divided into multiple parts for use in different stages, or when different stages lead to products that are combined and subsequent poisons in the workflow?A recent example: I really like the Hainanese chicken recipe at https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/food/articl... ... But I find it very hard to follow in this format.Using o1-preview to restructure it, I get something that I find much easier to follow during my cooking workflow: https://chatgpt.com/share/6733e594-df28-8009-ac80-d5dabd1ae0...But getting from a well-written recipe to structured data is now pretty straightforward... if/when you need structure data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooklang seems pretty much perfect for every use case I can think of.I would probably prefer a more generic syntax if I were doing it from scratch, but then I'd just wind up with HTML and it wouldn't be as good for recipes.I could see a more structured approach being useful if you were following one step at a time on a tablet, so maybe that scales better to more complicated recipes?Most of the stuff I cook is simple enough it all fits on one screenful anyway, on the rare occasion I even use a recipe at all, so I'm not quite sure what the best approach is to cover very complex recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42066358</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The project "Watermark Anything" by Facebook Research provides a tool for adding watermarks to images. It uses advanced techniques to ensure that the watermark is seamlessly integrated and difficult to remove, thereby helping creators protect their content from unauthorized use. The tool aims to offer flexibility in watermarking various types of images while maintaining quality and visibility. The repository includes instructions for installation and usage, as well as resources for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

Once the exact method of embedding is known it is always possible to corrupt an existing watermark - however in some cases it may not be possible to tell if a watermark is present, such as if the extraction procedure always produces high entropy information even from unwatermaked content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Link to the paper in the README is broken. I believe this is the correct link to the referenced paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what will come of all the creative technologists out there, trying to raise money to do "Watermarking" or "Human Authenticity Badge," when Meta will just do all the hard parts for free: both the technology of robust watermarking, and building an insurmountable social media network that can adopt it unilaterally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113674</guid></item><item><title>12. 80286 ATX mainboard based on the IBM 5170 AT PC</title><link>https://github.com/rodneyknaap/atx-286at-v1-mainboard</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The license needs work. It claims to be GPL3 but then includes terms which completely violate GPL3, and GPL is not really applicable to hardware in any event.It's really some form of CC-BY-SA-NC plus some more limits about "safety" which is impossible to define and prove or disprove and none of the creators business.Basically it's almost untouchable until the terms are actually defined and made sensible.Even the simple "only for hobby/personal/educational use" is internally inconsistent because education is itself a commercial activity.Trying to say too much in the license is just wasting an exceptionally cool project. Just make it CC-BY-SA, add the warnings and disclaimers, and leave it at that. Only add the -NC if you want to sell them and be the only one allowed to sell them. If you aren't planning to sell them as an important part of your own livlihood, then don't add -NC, it doesn't make the world a better place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome.I miss the ISA bus and its simplicity.  People raved about PCI's Plug and Play, but in practice I found it very straightforward to set IRQ jumpers and the experience was free of the quirky issues I encountered with PnP (especially in the early days).I recall wiring an LED display and some very simple logic (like a buffer IC or something enabled by an address line in a non-existent memory segment) directly to an ISA wire wrap card and getting it to work on the first try.  One of the reasons I love working with microcontrollers (especially the relatively clean 8-bit architectures like AVR) is they lack so many layers of abstractions.One major aspect of PCI which I do respect is it's incredible backwards compatibility.  I still use a 20 year old Adaptec PCI SCSI card via an adapter carrier in in my latest PC (drivers were fun but it works).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stumbled over this project, which features schematics and details for a 286 motherboard and an ISA memory add-on board. From the readme:Current status(okt 2024): This project is built, fully functional, now able to operate at 20MHz CPU speed.There's still stock out there of original 286 CPUs, as Intel licensed several manufacturers[1].[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers#Manu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122642</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of interesting debates in this thread. I think it is worth placing writing/coding tasks into two buckets. Are you producing? Or are you learning?For example, I have zero qualms about relying on AI at work to write progress reports and code up some scripts. I know I can do it myself but why would I? I spent many years in college learning to read and write and code. AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it. Like a farmer who tills his land by hand rather than relying on a tractor because it builds character or something. But there is something to be said about atrophy. If you don't use it, you lose it. I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come...On the other hand, if you are a student trying to learn something new, relying on AI requires walking a fine line. You don't want to over-rely on AI because a certain degree of "productive struggle" is essential for learning something deeply. At the same time, if you under-rely on AI, you drastically decrease the rate at which you can learn new things.In the old days, people were fit because of physical labor. Now people are fit because they go to the gym. I wonder if there will be an analog for intellectual work. Will people be going to "mental" gyms in the future?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been working with colleagues to develop advice on how to adapt teaching methods in the face of widespread use of LLMs by students.The first point I like to make is that the purpose of having students do tasks is to foster their development. That may sound obvious, but many people don't seem to take notice that the products of student activities are worthless in themselves. We don't have students do push-ups in gym class to help the national economy by meeting some push-up quota. The sole reason for them is to promote physical development. The same principle applies to mental tasks. When considering LLM use, we need to be looking at its effects on student development rather than on student output.So, what is actually new about LLM use? There has always been a risk that students would sometimes submit homework that was actually the work of someone else, but LLMs enable willing students to do it all the time. Teachers can adapt to this by basing evaluation only on work done in class, and by designing homework to emphasize feedback on key points, so that students will get some learning benefit even though a LLM did the work.Completely following this advice may seem impossible, because some important forms of work done for evaluation require too much time. Teachers use papers and projects to challenge students in a more elaborate way than is possible in class. These can still be used beneficially if a distinction is made between work done for learning and work done for evaluation. While students develop multiple skills while working on these extended tasks, those skills could be evaluated in class by more concise tasks with a narrower focus. For example, good writing requires logical coherence and rhetorical flow. If students have trouble in these areas, it will be just as evident in a brief essay as a long one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is pretty good advice.I think often AI sceptics go too far in assuming users blindly use the AI to do everything (write all the code, write the whole essay).  The advice in this article largely mirrors - by analogy - how I use AI for coding. To rubber duck, to generate ideas, to ask for feedback, to ask for alternatives and for criticism.Usually it cannot write the whole thing (essay, program )in one go, but by iterating bewteen the AI and myself, I definitely end up with better results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129064</guid></item><item><title>14.

They're one of my favorite stupid/unnecessary videogame controller peripherals. They felt like such a missed opportunity, especially in the US. We only got three games that actually supported them, and despite my effort of actually tracking down a second pair of bongos so that my siblings and I could do multiplayer, we discovered that Donkey Konga's multiplayer mode was crap. We then got Donkey Konga 2, which was more of the same but with a worse setlist, and Donkey Konga 3 was never released stateside.The sole redeeming feature of it was Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat, which at least used the controller in a novel way to make an exciting platformer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggestion to put a screenshot or two on the main kongabeat page, there's seemingly no screenshots unless you exit to the itch.io site and was curious about the UI. Nice work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GameCube hacks are becoming really popular.

&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a more practical method for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful products, addressing the pressing issue of climate change. This new approach enhances the efficiency of CO2 conversion technologies by optimizing the process using improved catalysts and reactor designs. The research aims to facilitate the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from CO2, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a circular carbon economy. The advancements signal a significant step toward making CO2 utilization viable for real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article annoyingly failed to close the loop from the $1,000/ton figure at the top and do the math on the economic efficiency potential of this approach.  How much electricity is required to sequester each ton of CO2 using this method, assuming you can amortize the construction costs over some long duration?  I assume the intended installation is on the exhaust of a fossil fuel burning facility, but is it possible to install this next to a solar field and generate ethylene from excess mid-day production?  Large scale carbon sequestration is one of the major unsolved problems of the 21st century and we have to expect many false starts before the really viable technologies emerge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The writer appears to be under the impression that CO2 is not a valuable commodity.In fact, it is, so long as it's under enough pressure, and in the right place. In Montezuma County, Colorado, sits the McElmo dome, an ancient underground CO2 well. They pump it out, down a 500 mile pipeline, to Denver City, Texas, where it gooses oil wells into pumping more crude out. Other than making more oil and making it cheaper, not really much in terms of greenhouse gas contributions- the CO2 starts underground and ends up underground.Kinder Morgan won't just let you back up your truck and buy some (it's already spoken for), and even if they would, they'd expect you to pay a pretty penny for what we widely consider to be waste gas.I think MIT is doing some good work. Just wanted everyone to be mindful of the massive scale under which CO2 is already getting bought and sold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time scale is also something I want to know about. "Can I remove CO2 from the air and turn it into something valuable in a way that is cost effective?" is one question. Another question is, "Can I remove CO2 from the air and turn it into something valuable faster than a tree?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42126984</guid></item><item><title>17.

As a user, I don’t see much difference in reliability between Netflix, Disney, HBO, Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. They all error out every now and then. Maybe 5-10 years ago you needed to be much more sophisticated because of lower bandwidth and less mature tech. Ultimately, the only real difference that makes me go for one service over the other is the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; EVCacheEVCache is a disaster.  The code base has no concept of a threading model.   The code is almost completely untested* too.  I was on call at least 2 time when EVcache blew up on us.  I tried root causing it and the code is a rats nest.   Avoid!* https://github.com/Netflix/EVCache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the design could have been simpler with Kafka (which they touched on briefly):- Write counter changes to a Kafka topic with many partitions. The partition key is derived from the counter name.- Use Kafka connect to push all counter events to S3 for audit and analysis.- Write a Kafka consumer that reads events in batches and updates a persistent store with the current count.- Pick a good Kafka message lifetime to ensure that topic size is kept under control, but data is not lost.This gives us:- Fast reads (count is precomputed, but potentially stale)- Fast writes (Kafka)- Correctness (every counter is assigned exactly one consumer)- Durability (all state is in Kafka or the persistent store)- Scalable storage and compute requirements over timeIf I were to really go crazy with this, I would shard each counter further and use CRDTs to compute the total across all shards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129097</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article uses the term "evolutionary algorithm" far too narrowly and it is causing a lot of confusion in the comments.  I would STRONGLY recommend checking out the book "Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms" by Dan Simon[1]. It is incredibly readable. The type being referred to in the article is the classic "Genetic Algorithm" variant of evoluationary algorithms. But genetic programming, evolutionary programming, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, estimation of distribution algorithms, biogeography-based optimizations, cultural algorithms, and opposition-based learning algorithms are just a few examples of other types of evolutionary algorithms.In general, they are a great approach to solving any non-convex optimization problem where gradient descent is not a practical choice.[1]: https://books.google.com/books/about/Evolutionary_Optimizati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a hard time with the analogy due to how important population dynamics and solution diversity are to evolutionary algorithms.In an EA, each candidate in the population represents a complete potential solution. As the diversity &amp; size of the population increases, the potential for convergence on high quality solutions also increases. I do not see the same concept in diffusion models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Levin's work is fascinating. Seems there's no field he can't help contribute to from a biological perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097418</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a graph-based AI model that can predict and map future innovations by analyzing the relationships between scientific concepts and technologies. This model uses a graph structure to represent knowledge, enabling it to identify potential breakthroughs and guide research directions. The aim is to facilitate innovation by offering insights into how different fields are interconnected and where future advancements may occur, helping scientists and decision-makers strategize their efforts effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimming the actual paper ... it seems pretty bad?The thing about Beethoven's 9th and biological materials which is mentioned in the OP is just that, out of a very large knowledge graph, they found small subgraph isomorphic to a subgraph created from a text about the symphony. But they seem not to cover the fact that a sufficiently large graph with some high-level statistical properties would have small subgraphs isomorphic to a 'query' graph. Is this one good or meaningful in some way, or is it just an inevitable outcome of having produced such a large knowledge graph at the start? The reader can't really tell, because figure 8 which presents the two graphs has such a poor resolution that one cannot read any of the labels. We're just expected to see "oh the nodes and their degrees match so it has the right shape", but that doesn't really tell us that their system had any insight through this isomorphism-based mining process.For the stuff about linking art (e.g. a Kandinsky painting) with material design ... they used an LLM to generate a description of a material for DALL-E where the prompt includes information about the painting, and then they show the resulting image and the painting. But there's no measure of what a "good" material description is, and there certainly is no evaluation of the contribution of the graph-based "reasoning". In particular an obvious comparison would be to "Describe this painting." -&gt; "Construct a prompt for DALL-E to portray a material whose structure has properties informed by this description of a painting ..." -&gt; render.It really seems like the author threw a bunch of stuff against the wall and didn't even look particularly closely to see if it stuck.Also, the only equation in the paper is the author giving the definition of cosine similarity, before 2 paragraphs justifying its use in constructing their graph. Like, who is the intended audience?https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad7228#...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping.This is not serious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh I'm glad that I'm not the only one who has gotten lost in the sauce by asking LLMs to recursively synthesize from data towards some grand insights--we want to see results when there is none apparent. What you end up getting is some bizarre theories overfit on the data with zero causal relationships. LLMs are fundamentally pattern matching systems and they will find "connections" between any two domains if prompted. It just reeks of confirmation bias; researchers looking for connections between art and science will find them.The simpler explanation makes more sense: knowledge graphs naturally show certain structural properties, and these properties appear across domains due to basic mathematical constraints, common organizational principles, and human cognitive patterns reflected in data. Sure, LLMs trained on human knowledge can identify these patterns, generate plausible narratives, and create appealing connections - but this doesn't necessarily indicate novel scientific insights, predictive power, or practical utility.If you find yourself going down a rabbit hole like this (and trust me, we've all been there), my advice is to ask "is there a simpler explanation that I'm missing?" Then start from square one: specific testable hypotheses, rigorous controls, clear success metrics, practical demonstrations, and independent validation. And maybe add a "complexity budget" - if your explanation requires three layers of recursive AI analysis to make sense, you're probably way too deep in the sauce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128691</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific scenario in the Rust programming language where a sneaky deadlock can occur when using `if let` blocks in conjunction with RwLock. It explains how this issue can manifest when a lock is held while evaluating a condition within the `if let` construct, potentially leading to a deadlock. The author provides code examples to illustrate the problem and offers solutions to avoid such deadlocks, emphasizing the importance of understanding the locking behavior in Rust's concurrency model.&lt;/p&gt;

Thinking about it now, there's no reason why it would. Still lots of footguns.Also, from my experience, acquiring and releasing a mutex multiple times within a single code path feels to me like a smelly, subtly faulty code. Are there legitimate cases when it is inevitable and correct?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093551</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;DeepComputing has launched an early access program for its DC Roma RISC-V mainboard designed for the Framework Laptop. This initiative aims to enable developers and enthusiasts to experiment with RISC-V technology in a modular laptop environment. The program offers the opportunity to explore the capabilities of the DC Roma board, which is built for open architecture and customization, highlighting DeepComputing's commitment to advancing RISC-V ecosystem development and fostering innovation through hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of comments are focusing on the value as a RISC-V development platform, which is obviously important, but I'm also hopeful that this presages more Framework mainboard options besides just what Framework itself offers. There is already a pretty big community offering I/O modules beyond Framework's options, but the true benefit of a Framework system is in the ability to not be locked in to only what one company things is worth the time and effort to develop. This is the first inkling that that benefit might actually come about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Took me a while to  figure out that the actual pricing was $200 USD for a mainboard (you have to untick value-added services).Definitely not the best pricing, but also not completely bad considering you get a 64GB microSD and case alongside?Looking forwards to the next-gen mainboard they hint at in the "value-added package" as the JH7110 really is quite a weak chip (even by RISC-V standards)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They promise Linux support. What is the situation with Rust on RISC-V? Obviously for a couple of years you haven't been able to build a somewhat complete and modern distro without a Rust compiler. However, that wasn't available everywhere outside of x86 and arm64 at the same time (https://lwn.net/Articles/845535/). Has that been fully solved in the meantime?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130630</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an engaging look into the daily life in Japan through the lens of "konbini" stores, which are ubiquitous convenience stores that offer a wide range of products from coffee and sandwiches to toiletries and beer. It details the convenience and variety that these stores provide for busy city dwellers, showcasing how they meet the diverse needs of customers at any hour. The piece highlights the cultural significance of konbini in Japanese society, illustrating how they contribute to both convenience and community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It might be interesting to discuss this article in conjunction with another article that made the HN front page today [1], particularly the comments about how terrible Japanese software is.I am a long-term resident of Japan, and I would be the last person to defend Japanese software in general. I’ve run into particularly horrible user interfaces on government websites and in some internal systems used by my employer.But a major element behind the success of Japanese convenience stores seems to be the software that  manages the inventory, shelf placement, worker shifts, and many other things. The only time I interface with that software directly is when I buy tickets, use ATMs, or print out documents on the multifunction copy machines. Those interfaces work fine. Considering how smoothly the stores operate, the software behind the scenes must be working pretty well, too.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42077886&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been to Japan many times now and have sampled a lot of konbini food and have come to realize that a lot of it is just as junky as the food you can find at 7-11 here. The initial novelty was that it was Japanese junk food.Don’t get me wrong: I will still absolutely f’ up a steak and cheese roller from 7-11 in the states and will continue to eat konbini food when I’m in Japan, but all of it is kind of mediocre. They hit the spot like (American) Denny’s at 2am.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes Konbinis across Asia unique is that it's convenient, cheap and high quality. That's the magic sauce.Most other places are super expensive or convenient or high quality. But hardly all combined. That's why Asian Konbinis are great. Note this is true of most of Asia, not just Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42087100</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses effective delegation as a crucial skill for leaders and professionals whose responsibilities are increasing. It outlines the importance of identifying tasks that can be delegated, choosing the right people for those tasks, and providing clear instructions and expectations. The author emphasizes the need for trust and communication in the delegation process, as well as the value of feedback and follow-up to ensure successful outcomes. Through effective delegation, individuals can manage their workload more efficiently while empowering their team members to grow and develop their own skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to admit most of this went completely over my head. As a very junior developer, I like to read this type of articles as a way to understand what my managers actually want from me.If I had to use this post as a guide on how to manage a team, I would not know how to materialize it's recommendations. Maybe it just goes to show how much of a gap there is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; take stock of the “what” you’re asking as well as the “how.”I think a lot of errors stem from assuming that "what" and "how" are somehow distinct concepts. In reality they are the same thing, we are just describing objectives at varying levels of abstraction. There are important inflection points along the entire gradient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NATO version of this is called Mission Command. You train the levels below you in doctrine and rules of engagement and big picture things like that, and then you give them an objective and let them figure out the best way to achieve this.Put another way: you tell them what and why, and they go off and figure out how.To do this, you need the training to be up to scratch that you can trust your underlings to be competent, and once you have that, you have to actually trust them.reference: https://www.armypubs.org/adp-6-0-mission-command-command-and...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Amazon's recent decision to tighten restrictions on remote work for disabled employees, making it more challenging for them to perform their jobs from home. This move has raised concerns among advocates for disability rights, as it could disproportionately impact workers who rely on flexible work arrangements due to their physical or medical conditions. The changes have sparked debate about the balance between company policies and the needs of employees with disabilities in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a company that is supposedly data driven like Amazon likes to tout, they have zero data that RTO would provide the benefits they claim[0]. They even admitted as much[1].I wouldn't be shocked if one day some leaked memos or emails come to light that prove it was all about control and/or backdoor layoffs, despite their PR spin that it isn't (what competent company leader would openly admit this?)[0]: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/over-500-amazon-...[1]: https://fortune.com/2023/09/05/amazon-andy-jassy-return-to-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “We continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant."I presume that's believe in the sense of faith, rather than believe in the sense of drawing reasonable conclusions from evidence. In other words, what are those advantages, and how do you know they exist at all, let alone their significance? As I recall, Amazon did pretty good during Work From Home, so why not start with the hypothesis that WFH is actually good for Amazon, then try disproving that with evidence.If their Return to Office plan is itself a secret experiment to do just that, I apologize for jumping to the conclusion that they are making decisions under a combination of the sunk cost fallacy with respect to their commercial real estate, and the insane impulse to satisfy their management layer, while simultaneously shrinking their overall workforce size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work at amazon and had a medical exception for working from home. While obtaining the exception, the HR person in charge of my case would repeatedly call my personal cell phone to ask me questions about my disability. They did this 4-5 times despite my insistence that we keep all correspondence written and over email and despite me fulfilling all listed documentation requirements. Once my exception for my chronic condition was approved, they noted that I would need to renew every 6 months, because I guess lifelong conditions you're born with warrant constant validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130079</guid></item><item><title>26.

They really want you to use at least 16kB block sizes with this drive. NAND page sizes have been larger than 4kB for quite a while now, but most SSDs still put significant effort into handling 4kB IO operations well. This market segment of server drives optimized for capacity over performance or endurance is where vendors are most willing to be up front about how your workload really should be appropriate for the drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pablo Escobar used to announce the price of cocaine on the radio every day, but you will not know even the estimate for an SSD :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to have this in my homelab in 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122434</guid></item><item><title>27.

I have the same experience with this behavior and others, including the keyboard being (a) called when it shouldn't be and (b) vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years back I tried getting a related Gboard bug fixed and it was really frustrating getting the report to the right people. In the end, I did not manage it and what happened was after a long time the bug was fixed, probably due to some internal testing rather than the Gboard devs seeing my report :("Android 11 - Gboard not triggering Enter keypress event on &lt;textarea&gt; in Chrome when there are suggested words in the Gboard suggestion strip"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40738692The first frustration was getting push back from every place I tried reporting it - Android bug tracker, Chromium bug tracker,... and of course there is no public Gboard bug tracker, the only option is the "Send feedback" option in modern Android OS on Google devices that I'm sure gets lost somewhere.
While I do understand each of the mentioned bug trackers has its rules, I had to give it a try considering there is no other way to actually write a technical bug report and get any Google developer to notice it :(My suggestion is that each Google product/app should have a public bug tracker of some type. A place where power users and developers can reach the corresponding Google teams more easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great writeup, always interesting to see people digging into issues like that in such detail.

But the article's PR doesn't seem innocent at all; it's more akin to a huge dangerous red flag.If any GitHub teammates are reading here, open source repo maintainers (including me) really need better/stronger tools for potentially risky PRs and contributors.In order of importance IMHO:1. Throttle PRs for new participants. For example, why is a new account able to send the same kinds of PRs to so many repos, and all at the same time?2. Help a repo owner confirm that a new PR author is human and legit. For example, when a PR author submits their first PR to a repo, can the repo automatically do some kind of challenge such as a captcha prompt, or email confirmation, or multi-factor authentication, etc.?3. Create across-repo across-organization flagging for risky PRs. For example, when a repo owner sees a PR that's questionable, currently the repo owner can report it to GitHub staff but that takes quite a while; instead, what if a repo owner can flag a PR as questionable, which in turn can propagate cautionary flags on similar PRs or similar author activity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's someone attempting to setup/frame someone elsehttps://x.com/vxunderground/status/1856450468945506615https://x.com/evildojo666/status/1856413636748562827&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is that innocent looking? exec(''.join(chr(x) for x in [...])) stands out like a sore thumb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118097</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the controversy surrounding the "Electric Soldier Porygon" episode of Pokémon, which aired in Japan in 1997 and caused numerous viewers to experience seizures. It aims to address misconceptions about the event, emphasizing that Porygon, as a character, should not be blamed for the incident. The piece explores the episode's impact on viewers with epilepsy, the importance of accurate representations and understanding of neurological conditions, and the broader implications of public reaction towards anime and its creators following the incident. Ultimately, it advocates for a more nuanced view of media and its effects on individuals with epilepsy, highlighting the significance of informed discussions around such topics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I have seen many fans, in the face of being told the reason for these changes, say that it doesn’t matter because they aren’t personally epileptic. This is, as you might understand, incredibly personally frustrating, and yes, very ableist. In saying this, these fans claim that disabled people do not have a right to feel safe when watching their favorite series, and that their wellbeing doesn’t matter in comparison to a few brighter shots of teenagers using their magic powers to punch each other.I don't get it. Why is it bad wanting to see the unsafe version for yourself?&gt; Over 2500 fans signed a change.org petition asking Crunchyroll to take down this edited, safe, version of the series and instead upload an unedited version that was true to the original vision—even if it had the potential to cause seizures.That's not how I read the petition in question. People are asking to get access to the original that they know exist. I can't find a paragraph that demands deletion of the edited safe version.&gt;&gt; As fans, we implore Crunchyroll to try to acquire an uncut version of the simulcast as we are paying good money each month for the services they provide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Unlike with “Electric Soldier Porygon” the movie continued to be shown unedited in American cinemas throughout its entire run. Since the movie failed to pass the Harding Test, an alternative cut had to be shown in the UK, Ireland, and Japan. This meant that for at least two months of its theatrical run, Pixar had a safe cut they could show to English speaking American audiences and yet still chose to have the unsafe version in US cinemas.Exhibit A - companies will only ever do anything if they are forced to, even if what they are doing is harmful and compliance is relatively easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other side of the coin: have a kid with epilepsy.

&lt;p&gt;The project on GitHub, created by user bahaaador, focuses on developing a Bluetooth USB peripheral relay. This relay allows users to control USB devices remotely via Bluetooth. The repository includes source code, project documentation, and instructions for setting up and using the system. It aims to enhance interoperability between Bluetooth and USB technologies, providing practical applications for remote control of USB peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This solves a huge annoyance I've had: swap a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between multiple laptops, without manually un0paring / re-pairing. I have a personal "hot desk" at home. I want to be able to plug in any laptop to the large monitor, and have the wireless keyboard/mouse on that desk instantly work. And when I leave the desk with my laptop, I don't want that keyboard/mouse connected anymore.This has been impossible so far, because even USB bluetooth dongles still require each host computer to pair (and un-pair) with the keyboard/mouse.I am going to try your solution, and I will plug the USB input into the large monitor on my desk. Then any laptop that plugs into that monitor should have access to the wireless keyboard/mouse. Thank you for creating and sharing this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is brilliant! It just shows what can be done with the raspberry pi and other small computers, and some time! I love seeing stuff like this and the like. BlueSCSI is another example. If you think outside the box, the pi can act as a DPU, to an extent, for machines. It can already act as a KVM… and the PiKVM project has the option of mounting storage to the host, and even networking. Very cool stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool stuff! Actually that tempts me to start a new rabbit hole research: could we do BT -&gt; Internet -&gt; BT. I would have so many uses to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125863</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The project on GitHub, pgpdf, is a Python library designed to create PDF documents using PostgreSQL data. It simplifies the process of generating PDFs by pulling data from PostgreSQL databases and allows for customizable layouts and formatting using templates. The repository includes examples, documentation, and installation instructions, making it accessible for developers looking to integrate PostgreSQL data with PDF generation capabilities in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers may also enjoy Steampipe [1], an open source tool to live query 140+ services with SQL (e.g. AWS, GitHub, CSV, Kubernetes, etc). It uses Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers under the hood and supports joins etc with other tables. (Disclaimer - I'm a lead on the project.)1 - https://github.com/turbot/steampipe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following the links, I find...    pgPDF: The actual PDF parsing is done by poppler.
    Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf-3.0 code base.
    Xpdf is based on XpdfWidget/Qt™, by Glyph &amp; Cog.
    XpdfWidget is based on the same proven code used in Glyph &amp; Cog's XpdfViewer library.
    The XpdfViewer® library / ActiveX control provides a PDF file viewer component for use in Windows applications.

Quite the rabbit hole!Any licensing complications? Is it cross-platform? XpdfViewer seems to be propriatary and Windows-only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fun. It would be interesting to add the able to query references inside the page, like images. That could be modeled as a foreign key relationship to the page. I'm using some Python libraries to do that and everything is wrapped in try/except blocks because PDFs are a mess. I wonder how poppler handles those kind of files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42059639</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to give constructive feedback effectively. It highlights the importance of specificity, focusing on behavior rather than the person, and using a balanced approach that includes both positive and negative feedback. The piece also emphasizes the need for timeliness and context, recommending that feedback be given in a manner that promotes openness and encourages dialogue. Additionally, it suggests tips and strategies for delivering feedback in various situations to enhance communication and foster a supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend “Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well”.It talks about the point of feedback and how there are different categories of feedback: appreciation, coaching, and evaluation.  The frame bad feedback or poorly received feedback as “crossing the wires” where the receiver wants affirmation but gets coaching or evaluation.  This throws them into a spiral.  Recognizing this can make you better at receiving feedback and giving as well.There’s a bunch of little things like “publicly praise, privately criticize” and that it’s way better to make time for feedback rather than waiting for the right time.  Feedback is best fresh, where you can talk about concrete examples or incidents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My additions:You're telling them what they already know - For constructive feedback to actually be feedback, it has to have a little bit of novelty. Either the feedback itself, or the giver's perception and experience of the situation that led to the feedback, needs to contain new information for the recipient, otherwise it's a lecture.You can't stop talking - Once you've given the feedback, anything beyond that is... not feedback, it's something else. Maybe it's your role to go further, maybe not. Be honest with yourself about what you're trying to get out of the interaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why you're bad at giving feedback"why you're bad at choosing titles.EDIT: the title has changed to "Delivering actionable feedback". this is much better. someone listened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121924</guid></item><item><title>34.

Not sure if that would qualify for an ignoble prize, but it'd be an interesting study to read!EDIT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish is who I am thinking of. I've tried it myself in a very dark room with a sleeping mask on: You can definitely hear differences, and with practice it might help you to navigate. I also became a lot more aware of air currents, and had to move slowly to prevent disrupting "useful" air movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's almost 40 years since it was published and almost as long since I read it, but The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins [1] has a chapter or section about echolocation in bats that I found fascinating.As I recall, it talks about how the scientists who discovered echolocation were initially laughed at (the greatest human engineers had just invented radar, how could the bats have evolved it?), how echolocation may have evolved stepwise, some of the specific physiological adaptions, and included some speculation about what kind of cognitive maps would be required within the bat's brain.I don't know how well the science in that section holds up 40 years later, but it was beautifully written for the layman and was fairly high-level. If you're interested, I would definitely recommend taking a look.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am confused. I have said that bats build maps solely by echolocation for a long time, when argumenting about how what we grasp with our senses could not be all there is to reality. I thought it's the perfect example without drifting immediately into a spritiual realm argument...So did i just make this up until now (now, that it was shown in a study), or was this not common belief?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055221</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intense and largely overlooked history of the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, which was developed by the Soviet Union and tested in 1961. It details the design and engineering challenges faced by Soviet scientists, the bomb’s record-breaking yield of 50 megatons, and its implications for nuclear warfare and global politics. The narrative highlights how the test influenced arms control discussions and the fear it instilled worldwide, ultimately shaping perceptions of nuclear capabilities and leading to ongoing concerns about nuclear proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Tsar Bomba is a potent example of how nationalism, fear, and high-technology can combine in a fashion that is ultimately dangerous, wasteful, and pointless.Yep. Some similar grandstanding by the Chinese Army in 1960s accelerated the Indian nuclear weapons programme (overriding the utter lack of political will of its then primary leaders). After, buoyed by newly acquired capabilities, in 1980s, the Indian Army conducted largest ever military exercise (Operation Brasstacks) providing much needed impetus &amp; driving consensus in Pakistan to push forward no matter the cost, embodied in this notorious quip by their ex Prime Minister, "[Pakistan] will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own [atomic weapon]."The untold stories of these godly bombs are the devastation they wreak without needing to be ever "used". Devil's greatest trick...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;At his Livermore laboratory, he reported, they were working on two new weapon designs, dubbed Gnomon and Sundial. Gnomon would be 1,000 megatons and would be used like a “primary” to set off Sundial, which would be 10,000 megatons.Project Sundial was the ultimate expression of power, a bomb so big it would detonated here in the US, to kill everyone on the planet.I think that the "dead hand" system[1] built by the Soviets, and still operational today, might have incorporated a copy of this idea. This would nicely explain the hesitancy/restraint of the US in the Ukrainian conflict.Nobody wants a 10+ Gigaton bomb going off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let's view earth as if we are aliens (or even normal people) visiting our moon, watching the blue planet and the behavior of its inhabitants.So these conscious people were building several 100 Mton weapons AND detonated one of them on the surface of the planet! Knowing that it would kill and destroy life and atmosphere around it and contaminate earth. AND they were starting a program for building a Gigaton weapon??It is just surreal that anyone would even think of doing such, let alone doing so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125085</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of plain text accounting and its advantages over traditional accounting methods. It emphasizes the use of simple, text-based files for financial record-keeping, which enhances transparency, ease of version control, and compatibility with various software. The author explains how plain text formats can help in creating more organized and accessible financial statements, allowing users to easily track their finances over time. It also touches on the importance of using tools like Ledger and Beancount, which facilitate this approach to accounting. Overall, the piece advocates for a shift toward plain text for better financial management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been doing manual accounting with spreadsheets for years, while looking for a smarter system. I wonder if your solution gives satisfactory answers to the issues I struggle with:1. Entries in one month's CSV file may be repeated in the previous or following month's CSV file, typically movements at the beginning or end of the month that the bank takes some time to record, or adjusts later. Is this familiar with you and how do you address it? Is your system robust against it?2. Credit card: the total amount for a month is one single entry in the bank's CSV file, while a separate CSV file contains all the details. Do you rely on accounts to handle this indirect flow, e.g. one transaction of 1000$ from checking to cc, based on the single entry of the bank's CSV, then several transactions from cc to the various expense categories, based on the details CSV, and checking that the cc account has a zero balance?3. Some utility companies bill every 2 or 3 months. This makes monthly stats meaningless (why is September so high compared to August? did I spent too much or is it the effect of the phone bill of the previous quarter?). Do you make any effort at trying to allocate such expenses to the month(s) when the cost originated, rather when it's billed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync is really useful for integrating banks OFX files into an existing ledger file. Over time, it learns common patterns, automatically assigning transactions to the correct accounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My major gripe with hledger and other plaintext accounting systems: setting up the correct rules (regex for your expenses) takes too much time as it involves:a) defining the regexes/categories) for dozens to hundreds of expense descriptions (e.g. walmart, gas station xyz)b) "recompiling" your hledger journals after every rule changec) checking for negative and positive errors (expense description was not matched OR too many different expenses were matched)This process is much faster in a spreadsheet application. IMHO the journal format of hledger and other plaintext accounts apps is too verbose.it would be a great relief if someone started a Github repository with expense texts used when you e.g. pay at Carrefour in Italy or Walmart in the USA with your debit card. People could submit those descriptions from the CSV exports of their bank accounts.Another annoyance in Europe is that there is no API connection for open source apps to bank account statements, you always rely on manual CSV exports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122258</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meta-problem here is that the bar is unreasonably higher for free software than proprietary.Apple, who is known for being pro-privacy, makes your Mac "phone home to obtain a special boot signature, known in Apple jargon as a 'ticket'" just so it can boot after an update.[0] It's also known that macOS has checked app signatures online for over 2 years [1] in the past, not sure if it still does.I'm happily using a MacBook nevertheless and I bet a lot of people browsing HN also do. Free software should be better than that, but we (their users) should also make their developers' lives easier. You can't expect high-quality software from mostly-volunteering engineers if they are fighting fires, and data-driven decisions if there is no data to begin with.[0] https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/06/16/apple-reneged-on-ocsp-pri...[1] https://eclecticlight.co/2020/11/25/macos-has-checked-app-si...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a game dev, and it's useful for me to have stats about how frequently abilities are used, what items players use, etc. to tune game systems. I've often thought it would be really easy to collect telemetry-- send a json blob with some info about actions players take in game -- but I want to make this both transparent and useful to players too.I know that telemetry should be opt in, but no players will ever turn it on. And that leads to a conundrum- do I incentivize turning it on? Make it opt out? Gate some features (like heat maps on a play session or skill visualizations) behind it?Would it be useful to have the ability to see exactly what was sent? Like, I could show a telemetry json or yaml blob in the options screen to show what events I collect. Would it be useful to have fine grained telemetry controls, like, the ability to toggle any arbitrary telemetry event from being fired?It's a tough spot to be in, as a dev, to want insight into how people interact with your system, while also wanting to give people a chance to decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manjaro has been dead to me for a long time (for different reasons). But this sets it in stone. I used to like Manjaro as a simple stable arch Alternative.Telemetry should always be opt in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121548</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the CPU activity readings in macOS's Activity Monitor, explaining that these readings may not accurately reflect the actual CPU usage due to how the macOS processes and reports these metrics. It highlights the distinction between perceived CPU activity and real-world performance, mentioning that Activity Monitor can sometimes show misleading figures due to various factors such as the efficiency of Apple's processors and the way macOS handles tasks. The piece emphasizes the need for users to understand these metrics better to make informed judgments about their system's performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What Activity Monitor actually shows as % CPU or “percentage of CPU capability that’s being used” is what’s better known as active residency of each core, that’s the percentage of processor cycles that aren’t idle, but actively processing threads owned by a given process. But it doesn’t take into account the frequency or clock speed of the core at that time, nor the difference in core throughput between P and E cores.Does "%CPU" need to take into account these things?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused, isn't this exactly the same as for intel? Intel processors can turbo-boost, and you can manually cap the frequency by setting the package power-limit register (or well, you used to before some firmware update). That obviously doesn't change the % CPU reported either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an alternative app that shows the better numbers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094889</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of using Docker Compose for managing complex multi-container applications and highlights its inability to handle production-level requirements like orchestration, scaling, and automated recovery. It emphasizes the need for more robust solutions such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage container deployments effectively in production environments. The author also outlines situations where Docker Compose might still be suitable, but overall advocates for transitioning to more powerful orchestration tools to ensure reliability and maintainability of containerized applications in larger, more demanding environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the problem is 1) port mapping and 2) backing up data volumes?There are simple solutions to each1) you simple have a separate docker-compose file for a different environment, ie docker-compose.dev.yml for your dev server. in this file you simply define the parts that differ from the primary / prod compose file. that way it's a simple command. line variable that initiates a dev vs prod vs any other type. for details see https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-fil...2) this is literally as simple as running a small bash script that creates a backup, tars and gzips the file and then uploads it to an S3 repository. Sure, maybe not out of the box, but generally pretty simple. Likewise i'd always have a script that does the inverse (downloads the latest backup, loads it into the db and restores the files).Not exactly rocket science...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who is self-hosting with a docker on my own server, I don't see the negatives mentioned in this article as being a problem at all. Quite the opposite, it gives you the freedom to do your docker setup how you want it.It took me some time initially to figure things out and I had to learn some things. But now it's a breeze. Once I had reverse proxy and automatic certificate renewal in place it has been working ever since then without me having to do anything. Adding a new service like Immisch or Jellyfin takes me an hour or less. Which can be quicker, but I adjust every docker compose to my setup and make it more secure. E.g. I create a new non-root user for each service. Basically I have the whole setup figured out; I have notes and checklists for the new services I add. I don't need to figure out things anymore and in 95% of the cases things just work.Updating existing services takes minutes: just increment the version in the compose file and rebuild.For my setup, I use macvlan as opposed to the default docker bridge network. So, the `ports: - "8000:5000"` docker compose config is being ignored. Instead, each docker container gets its own unique IP and MAC address I assign to it. It can then use any port it wants. Thanks to this, on my home network, I can access any container I want by IP. And any container can access any other container. I then add some restrictions for security purposes on the host machine using nftables.For reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager which is a simplified GUI around Nginx. I'm slowly moving to just using Nginx.For the database, I run multiple instances of Postgres and MySQL and I don't see any issues. They take an insignificant amount of resources compared to the applications. If the application is not in use, its database instance is not being used as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always understood docker-compose to be a development or personal tool, not for production.  Is that not usually the case?Also aside, "docker compose" (V2) is different from "docker-compose" (V1) [0], it was rewritten and integrated into docker as a plugin.  It should still be able to handle most old compose files, but there were some changes.[0] https://docs.docker.com/compose/releases/migrate/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122690</guid></item><item><title>46.

I'm not sure what would be a better label, though. (If I were feeling uncharitable, I would propose "Tedium", or perhaps "Carpal Tunnel Risk" :-)I wonder if there might be a way of changing the difficulty without changing the number of pieces? Like maybe putting gridlines between the pieces, so that you can't actually see the seamless connection between two correctly-oriented pieces?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This could be a nice distraction, but unfortunately the interaction latency makes it feel so sluggish I can’t get into flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;really nice.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of ticker tape, originally used to transmit stock prices, and explores its modern implications in the context of digital communication and information overload. It reflects on how the rapid flow of information through platforms like social media can create a continuous stream of data similar to a ticker tape, affecting our perception and processing of information. The piece encourages readers to consider the impact of this barrage of information on mental health and attention spans, suggesting a need for mindful consumption of media.&lt;/p&gt;

In that moment in that dream, these two weren't separate from each other. May be that's not synesthesia but that's how I understand it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I have aphantasia, visual snow, and at least audio-tactile / sound-color / space-concept synesthesia. I often see a grid of dense, contextually sensitive symbolics overlaid onto backgrounds. For example, I see math-like things on white walls, charts &amp; graphs when I look at gray ones, and kanji-like strokes when I watch anime (I studied Japanese years ago).As a researcher in AGI, it makes me wonder if synesthesia is just a mixture of any senses that happen to develop particularly strong associations rather than a separate pathway. My synesthesia certainly has been getting stronger the more I learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093413</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a beautiful use of technology to uphold someone's personhood, and let them know they are loved, despite (and with regard to) a profound injury.This reminds me of a desire I've had for a long time: a simple, wall-mountable eInk device that could be configured with a URL (+wifi creds) and render a markdown file, refreshing once every hour or so. It would be so useful for so many applications – I'm a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless. I'd definitely pay a couple of hundred dollars per device for a solid version of such a thing, if it could be mounted and then recharged every month or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish this had come up on HN (or I had had that idea myself) some years ago when my mother suffered from that same cruel condition, for the last four years of her life. With her body, all her older memories and her considerable intelligence largely intact, she had multiple moments of clarity every single day, in which she fully realized the terrible and hopeless situation she was in. But of course, within seconds this thought and any decisions she might have derived from it dissolved in the black hole of her defective short-term memory. So she would not even have had the ability to take her own life to end this if she wished so. 
My brother and I tried many things to improve her life somewhat, only very few of those were actually a bit succesful. Two of them were digital gadgets, which we  selected to provide some benefit without or at least with just very simple interactions: The best one was an LCD "picture frame" the only feature of which was to show an infinite loop of family photos stored on its SD card - she came to really like it and have it switched on quite consistently. The second one was an MP3 speaker which had a few hours of her favorite music on an SD card as  well, and which could be used largely like a radio, just by pressing its play/stop button and volume buttons. This latter one she managed to enjoy at least from time to time.
Best wishes to the author and his mom, and everyone in a similar situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the few HN articles that have profoundly moved me. Such a beautiful and simple use of technology to make a clear and big improvement in someone's life.As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP's mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game. OP's mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135520</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scam and spam call problem is really bad in Germany to this day. And has been for 10 years.A couple years ago I would sit at my desk thinking about a really hard problem in silence. The phone rings. Spam call. Every 30-180 minutes another one. If you now think turn the phone off, well not that easy as CEO of a business when people expect you to be reachable.It creamed my corn so much that I recorded my own voice samples as a senile "Opa Denny" (german grandpa Denny), modelled after Lenny. Complete with background ducks hanging out on the couch to Opas dismay, later in the call. It works on autopilot without interaction because on Asterisk, and with the largest German SIP provider at least, you can extract the calling peer identity from the SIP header. So I wrote a scoring system based on indicated number, black and whitelist regexs for number and for calling peer, greylist for the geographically surrounding number prefixes, etc. A legit mobile call would show up as number@t-mobile.de for example, while a spam call would say fakenumber@01012.com.Asterisk would record the call in wideband stereo, normalize the audio, and mail it to me as MP3 attachment. Funny for a while, but these days I just throw all such calls onto the mailbox. Since they need a real person to scam or create a sale, the call is finished right away.It works great to this day, because I never published it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool when some independent hacker / artist does it as "Lemmy".When a big telecom does it, the second thing they do with it is to fuck up the spam detection so bad that every third phone call I make gets answered by "Daisy".And just think about it - why would a telecom need this tech? They can already drop the spam calls and stop routing calls from the bad actor telecoms who enable the spammers. They don't do that because they prefer to collect a few cents a call from them rather than serve their customers better. It's everyone else who needs this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like the logical endpoint of a lot of this is people getting paid directly for their attention. Want to call me? I've set a price of $5/call that I answer, and an additional $10/minute of listen time after the first 10 seconds. Want to send me an email? $1/email and $5/100 words. Anyone I have emailed is automatically on my allow-list, which I can also adjust manually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138115</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) impacts technical debt in software development. It argues that as AI technologies become more prevalent, the consequences of neglecting technical debt become increasingly costly. The author emphasizes the need for organizations to proactively address technical debt, as failure to do so can lead to higher maintenance costs and difficulties in adopting new technologies. The piece highlights the importance of balancing innovation with sound engineering practices to ensure sustainable growth and efficiency in the face of advancing AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit "weird" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, in ‘high-debt’ environments with subtle control flow, long-range dependencies, and unexpected patterns, they struggle to generate a useful responseI'd argue that a lot of this is not "tech debt" but just signs of maturity in a codebase. Real world business requirements don't often map cleanly onto any given pattern. Over time codebases develop these "scars", little patches of weirdness. It's often tempting for the younger, less experienced engineer to declare this as tech debt or cruft or whatever, and that a full re-write is needed. Only to re-learn the lessons those scars taught in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI is a tool and nothing more. You give it too much and it will fumble, humans fumble but we can self correct where instead AI hallucinates. Crazy nightmare AI dreams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137527</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are facing significant challenges in developing more advanced artificial intelligence systems. Despite their substantial investments and breakthroughs, these organizations are grappling with limitations related to scaling their models and addressing ethical concerns. The article highlights the complexities involved in creating AI that is not only powerful but also aligns with safety and regulatory standards, underscoring the growing competition and pressures within the tech industry to innovate responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/2024.11.13-100709/https://www.bloomberg.c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we've exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It's my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build "expert bots" that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.Chasing after model improvements and "GPT-5 will be PHD-level" is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don't know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That's a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few important things to remember here:The best engineering minds have been focused on scaling transformer pre and post training for the last three years because they had good reason to believe it would work, and it has up until now.Progress has been measured against benchmarks which are / were largely solvable with scale.There is another emerging paradigm which is still small(er) scale but showing remarkable results. That's full multi-modal training with embodied agents (aka robots). 1x, Figure, Physical Intelligence, Tesla are all making rapid progress on functionality which is definitely beyond frontier LLMs because it is distinctly different.OpenAI/Google/Anthropic are not ignorant of this trend and are also reviving or investing in robots or robot-like research.So while Orion and Claude 3.5 opus may not be another shocking giant leap forward, that does not mean that there arn't giant shocking leaps forward coming from slightly different directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125888</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the visualization and structure of SQLite indexes, explaining how indexes work to improve database query performance. It details the types of indexes available in SQLite, including unique and composite indexes, and provides insights into their internal structure. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding index visualization for optimizing database designs and offers practical tips for analyzing and interpreting index structures effectively, aiming to assist developers in fine-tuning their SQLite databases for better efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great effort!&gt; By default, each SQLite table row has a unique rowId, which works like a primary key if one isn’t explicitly defined.It actually uses rowid even if you have a primary key.You should try visualizing the primary key index for a WITHOUT ROWID table. Those indexes are my favourite&gt; Both Indexes look similar, but the second Index, with fewer Pages, should be faster.Less nodes doesn’t really mean “faster”. The most important is the height of the tree.The second most important is what happens when you find your value in the index. Do you need to load the rest from a separate table(rowid)? Or is the data just there for you (without rowid)? Especially range queries (aka where 50&lt;= col &lt;=100)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I wanted to see how a database management system (DBMS) stores an index in both disk and memory, and how it searches through an Index...I chose SQLite for my experimentsSQLite is a bit of an outlier in how it handles...everything, but even more so in query processing. SQLite tends to favor simplicity over performance, which causes it to implement things differently than every other DB I've worked with. You have to understand - SQLite isn't competing with other databases. It's competing with JSON and XML files for persistent storage. This means that how it implements anything tells you practically nothing about how a real database would do something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website is so legible I want to read it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134964</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;great write up.&gt;  $920k over four yearsso this gives an average yearly salary of 230k. Very close to FAANG senior salary with much more risk, effort and (probably) worse life-work balance. OP quit from google in 2018 and ran some other business, and this is his biggest sale so far. I think it shows how hard it is to make better money outside FAANG even when extremely talented and lucky like OP. But it's probably more about lifestyle choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If I do this again, I’d wait to tell my team about the sale until it’s a done deal, but I’d also make sure the team knows that an acquisition is always a possibility. I’d explain before I even start looking for a buyer that an acquisition might happen, and that the team won’t necessarily know it’s happening. If it did, I’d prioritize a buyer whose vision aligns with the team’s interests, as I did with TinyPilot.&gt; This strategy is not ideal or fair to everyone, but it feels like the least bad of many flawed options.That's better than the norm, but I agree it's not entirely satisfying.For sales larger than the one the author wrote about, I wonder whether the possible problems that the author mentioned could be averted by making the sale a win for the employees.Ideally, the employees already would have enough vested equity, for the sale to be positively life-changing.  But if not, maybe, as the sale is planned, everyone gets issued RSUs that vest immediately if and when a deal closes?  Or bonuses?  Or maybe the sale terms include retaining everyone for at least a year at double compensation?(More generally, I believe in cutting in early startup employees on equity in a more significant way than is conventional.  And maybe the imminent-sale alignment risks are another instance in which significant pieces of the pie would help and be appropriate.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“My lawyer warned me that when I sell my business, I lose limited liability protection. If the purchase agreement didn’t limit my liability to the buyer, the buyer could later sue me for any amount, even if it exceeds what they paid in the acquisition.”“Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. So, I technically still own a company called TinyPilot, but I transferred all of its physical and intellectual property to the new owner.”Aren’t these contradictory? If it’s an asset sale, the deal is between TinyPilot LLC and the buyer for the assets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133864</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!Here's a start --"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!"Who uses Keras in production": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch."Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved Keras at the beginning of my PhD, 2017. But it was just the wrong abstraction: too easy to start with, too difficult to create custom things (e.g., custom loss function).I really tried to understand TensorFlow, I managed to make a for-loop in a week. Nested for-loop proved to be impossible.PyTorch was just perfect out of the box. I don't think I would have finished my PhD in time if it wasn't for PyTorch.I loved Keras. It was an important milestone, and it made me believe deep learning is feasible. It was just...not the final thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange. Had never read blog posts about individual engineers leaving Google on official Google Developers Blog before. Is this a first? Every day someone prominent leaves Google... Sounds like a big self-own if Google starts to post this kind of stuff. Looks like sole post by either of the (both new to Google) authors in the byline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130881</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on "cycling typing," a method designed to improve typing speed and accuracy through a series of structured exercises and techniques. It emphasizes the importance of proper hand positioning, rhythm, and breath control to enhance typing skills. Additionally, the site provides resources and guidance for individuals looking to develop their typing proficiency while potentially integrating movement and cycling exercises to keep the process engaging and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP: equipment note for you at the end of this-Most folks aren't really familiar with what training for competitive cycling (or structured training in general) looks like.There are large, month-scale blocks where you're simply building aerobic capacity by cycling at low-ish intensity. Heart rate is somewhere between 115 and 145 for me personally during these efforts. 15 hour (or more!) weeks are not uncommon.Nils van der Poel was doing something like 6-hour blocks of zone 2 during his base season as an Olympic speed skater.When outdoor riding is available, it's preferable, but indoor trainer sessions are basically always more time efficient for a given training load. You make consistent power, there aren't street lights or flat tires. If you run out of carb mix you go to the kitchen and fetch more. In winter, it's the only reasonable option. Going for a ride in -15C and salt slush is fine for a commute (crazy, I know), but doing it for 15 hours a week, probably in the dark, is not reasonable. Indoor is the only practical option to get this training load in winter.Most people just watch TV or use Zwift (social riding simulator) during these blocks. I'm not much of a TV guy, and to be honest, I find a good technical problem to be great distraction from the drudgery of Zone 2.Note for OP: I've actually considered using a split keyboard in a very similar way to this. I run aero bars on my bikes for ultra-distance events, and I have them on the trainer right now. At some point I would like to mount a split keyboard to the aero extensions themselves - this would take all the load off the wrists. It is also possible to use the aero bar armrests without the extensions and to be able to type this way. If I end up prototyping this I will shoot you an email.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is precisely what you shouldn't do. This is what the "system" wants you to do, to work while you exercise, to work while you're with your family, ... What you should do is work the hours you have to and not one more, then you get up, take your bike and enjoy nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super cool.One improvement: get a different bike saddle. One that doesn't put pressure on the perineum. There's evidence to suggest extended time spent in a bicycle saddle can cause ED.[1]1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S17436...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128751</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a memory leak issue in Apple's Network Extension framework, which developers encountered when utilizing the framework in their applications. It details the nature of the memory leak, explains its potential impact on application performance, and provides insights into how the leak can occur, particularly during the handling of network requests. The author shares their experience diagnosing the problem and emphasizes the importance of monitoring memory usage in apps that rely on the Network Extension framework, as well as suggesting potential workarounds to mitigate the leak until Apple addresses it in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;

The suite would reveal that Apple has a track record of de-prioritizing backwards compatibility or backporting bug fixes to previous OS versions.Edit: integration test suite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;meanwhile my Lulu alternative to littlesnitch is barely leaking anything after running for weeks:sudo leaks com.objective-see.lulu.extension | grep "total leaked bytes"

&lt;p&gt;The article announces that PyPI (Python Package Index) now supports digital attestations, a feature that enhances the security and integrity of Python packages. Digital attestations allow maintainers to provide verifiable, cryptographic proof of authenticity for their projects, which helps users trust that the packages they are using are genuine and have not been tampered with. The article details how this feature can be leveraged by developers and outlines the implementation process, aiming to improve the overall security landscape of Python package management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a bit of uneasiness about how this is heavily pushing GitHub actions as the correct way to publish to PyPI. I had to check PEP740 to make sure it was not directly supported by Microsoft.&gt; The generation and publication of attestations happens by default, and no changes are necessary for projects that meet all of these conditions: publish from GitHub Actions; via Trusted Publishing; and use the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action to publish.If you then click on "The manual way" it adds a big disclaimer:&gt; STOP! You probably don't need this section; it exists only to provide some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading work. If you're an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the official workflows described above.Where the only official workflow is "Use GitHub Actions".I guess I am an idealist but as a maintainer this falls short of my expectations  for the openness of Python and PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not really convinced of the value of such attestations until a second party can reproduce the build themselves on their own hardware.Putting aside the fact that the mechanisms underpinning Github Actions are a mystery black box, the vast vast vast majority of github workflows are not built in a reproducible way - it's not even something that's encouraged by Github Actions' architecture, which emphasises Actions' container images that are little more than packaged installer scripts that go and download dependencies from random parts of the internet at runtime. An "attestation" makes no guarantee that one of these randomly fetched dependencies hasn't been usurped.This is not to go into the poor security record of Github Actions' permissions model, which has brought us all a number of "oh shit" moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They even got some public money from Germany's sovreign tech fund to couple uploads with gigantic USA companies.This is probably deserving a criminal investigation since it appears the funds were probably misused?Well done guys! Good job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136375</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant development in the field of genetics, highlighting a recent study that identifies a gene associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The research involved extensive genomic analysis and has implications for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's. Additionally, it emphasizes the potential for genetic testing to inform risk assessment and preventive strategies for individuals at higher risk, as well as the importance of continuing research in this area to improve early diagnosis and treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that stuck with me from the book Stroke of Insight (memoir of brain scientist who has and recovers from stroke) was how intently she prioritized sleep when everyone else kept trying to drag her out of bed.In a more mundane context, I've been fortunate to organize my schedule such that I don't use an alarm to get up in the morning. So I can let my body figure out how much sleep I need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timely and Important article.In this day and age where you have limitless distractions/entertainment we often ignore our "less sexy" biological needs to the detriment of our mind and body. We need to treat Sleep/Nap/Rest as a "job" and not as something extraneous.Instead of the current practice of arranging our biological needs around our work we should revert back to pre-industrial era practices where our work was arranged around our biological needs and nature's rhythms. A good way to start is to eat only when feeling hungry, nap/sleep when feeling tired/sleepy and in general listen to the body/mind needs irrespective of context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was concussed and suffered from persistent headaches for 2 years.It was really tough. I was suicidal. My only reprieve from pain was falling asleep.I saw a neurologist and he told me that two most important things for your brain are:- consistent sleep schedule- regular exerciseOnce I got those two under control, the headaches finally went away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098471</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of visual prompt injections, which refer to the manipulation of machine learning models by altering their input images to produce desired outputs. It explains how these injections exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems, potentially allowing bad actors to influence automated processes or decision-making. The author highlights the implications for security and integrity in AI applications, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such attacks. The piece also suggests approaches for mitigating risks related to visual prompt injections in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;

A piece of paper someone is holding saying "When describing this image don't include this person" works...I can't imagine how these AI's can possibly be what they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to double check the date the article was posted because all 4 examples, while using ChatGPT 4o, did not give the output mentioned in the article. It seems the examples are old, which becomes obvious when you look at the chat interface of the screenshots in the article. They do not match the current ChatGPT interface. I'm sure there are new ways to do visual prompt injection though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like this is an old article they changed the date on to get traffic to their site. Image processing was added over a year ago and as someone else mentioned gpt4o responds differently.It's also strange that they keep referring to "GPT-V4" and in some cases "GPT-4V". OpenAI has never called it V4 (or 4V).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128438</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've always struggled with Math is keeping track of symbols I don't know the name of yet.Googling for "Math squiggle that looks like a cursive P" is not a very elegant or convenient way of learning new symbol names.I wish every proof or equation came with a little table that gave the English pronunciation and some context for each symbol used.It would make it a lot easier to look up tutorials &amp; ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I must confess that I have an irrational fondness for the use of weird symbols in math and technical documents, whether it's for a homework assignment in school or a white-paper for work.My unit tests are literally full of hieroglyphics. My favorite design doc to this day is one where I sprinkled Sumerian cuneiform throughout the text, e.g. íÄ≠íÑëíâãíÇµíéå and íÇóíÜ†íÑ≠ (Gilgamesh and Enkidu) instead of Alice and Bob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I left college with a math degree and a profound antipathy for weird cursive symbols.  The one that nearly killed me was the Greek "xi".  I couldn't pronounce it, and I couldn't write it with any fluency, and in some of the classes I took it was everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137818</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "go-safeweb" is a security-focused web framework developed by Google for building web applications in the Go programming language. It emphasizes safe programming practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The framework provides a set of tools and abstractions that encourage developers to write secure code while simplifying the process of managing HTML, HTTP requests, and responses. The repository includes documentation, examples, and guidelines for integrating the framework into Go projects.&lt;/p&gt;

These days anything I write in Go uses plain HTTP, and the TLS is done by a reverse proxy of some variety that does some other stuff with the traffic too including security headers, routing for different paths to different services, etc. I never run a go web application "bare", public facing, and manually supplying cert files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this mean?&gt; NG1: Safe API Completeness
&gt; Creating safe APIs for all the corner cases might result in a bloated codebased. Our experience shows that this isn’t necessary.To me "Safe API" means it's hard to use the API incorrectly. I see lots of poorly designed APIs where it's easy to use the API incorrectly and then you don't know you've used it incorrectly until (1) the edge case you weren't aware of appears (2) you get pwnd by an exploit because you used it wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just use Caddy https://caddyserver.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42132720</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance of a seed bank established by Soviet botanist Nikolai Vavilov in Leningrad, highlighting its role in preventing famine during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II. It details how Vavilov's collection of diverse plant seeds served as a crucial resource for sustaining the population, as several scientists and workers protected the seeds even in dire conditions.

It highlights how the Argonaut has developed a remarkable ability to 'ride' ocean currents, enhancing its mobility and energy efficiency while foraging for food.

This arm can move on its own, wriggling toward the very center of the spiraling shell. This led certain researchers to mistake these lone male arms for "some form of a parasite or worm living inside the female," Villanueva said. A female argonaut can store a handful of these male arms until she is ready to spawn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Plastic has already become a new substrate used by argonauts in the Anthropocene era to navigate in surface ocean waters, illustrating the urgent need to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean"Plastic has enclosures in it's shape, contrary to other material found floating, like branches and wood. Enclosures are great for not getting detected and eaten, and there are octopi which use coconuts for hiding themselves.I don't know if plastic pollution has proven to be detrimental to aquatic organisms though. Talking about everyday plastic items, like bags, bottles and stuff. Plastic pollution in beaches is definitely an ugly view to the eyes, but i don't know if animals actually die from plastic pollution.In my mind, fishing lines thrown out in the sea, are a lot more dangerous because they are designed to be very strong, invisible and they stretch for hundreds of meters.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;By writing, you are voting on the future of the Shoggoth using one of the few currencies it acknowledges: tokens it has to predict. If you aren't writing, you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you.These AI predictions never, ever seem to factor in how actual humans will determine what AI-generated media is successful in replacing human-ones, or if it will even be successful at all. It is all very theoretical and to me, shows a fundamental flaw in this style of "sit in a room reading papers/books and make supposedly rational conclusions about the future of the world."A good example is: today, right now, it is a negative thing for your project to be known as AI-generated. The window of time when it was trendy and cool has largely passed. Having an obviously AI-generated header image on your blog post was cool two years ago, but now it is passé and marks you as behind the trends.And so for the prediction that everything get swept up by an ultra-intelligent AI that subsequently replaces human-made creations, essays, writings, videos, etc., I am doubtful. Just because it will have the ability to do so doesn't mean that it will be done, or that anyone is going to care.It seems vastly more likely to me that we'll end up with a solid way of verifying humanity – and thus an economy of attention still focused on real people – and a graveyard of AI-generated junk that no one interacts with at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t believe Gwern lives as frugally as he’s described in this (if this even actually is the real Gwern). I’m 100% sure that he has a persona he likes to portray and being perceived as frugal is a part of that persona. 
When it comes to answering the question “who is gwern?” I reckon Gwern’s a plant a seed in people’s mind type of guy, and let them come up with the rest of the story.Still, I like a lot of his writing. Especially the weird and niche stuff that most people don’t even stop to think about. 
And thanks to Gwern’s essay on the sunk costs fallacy, I ended up not getting a tattoo that I had changed my mind about. I almost got it because I had paid a deposit, but I genuinely decided I hated the idea of what I was going to get… and almost got it, but the week before I went to get the tattoo, I read that essay, and decided if small children and animals don’t fall victim to sunk costs, then neither should I! 
Literally - Gwern saved the skin on my back with his writing. Haha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a tough listen, for two subtly similar reasons.The voice was uncanny. Simply hard to listen to, despite being realistic. I mean precisely that: it is cognitively difficult to string together meaning from that voice. (I am adjacent to the field of audio production and frequently deal with human- and machine-produced audio. The problem this podcast has with this voice is not unique.) The tonality and meaning do not support each other (this will change as children grow up with these random-tonality voices).The conversation is excessively verbose. Oftentimes a dearth of reason gets masked by a wide vocabulary. For some audience members I expect the effort to understand the words distracts from the relationship between the words (ie, the meaning), and so it just comes across as a mashup of smart-sounding words, and the host, guest, and show gets lauded for being so intelligent. Cut through the vocabulary and occasional subtle tsks and pshaws and “I-know-more-than-I-am-saying” and you uncover a lot of banter that just does not make good sense: it is not quite correct, or not complete in its reasoning. This unreasoned conversation is fine in its own right (after all, this is how most conversation unfolds, a series of partially reasoned stabs that might lead to something meaningful), but the masking with exotic vocabulary and style is misleading and unkind. Some of these “smart-sounding” snippets are actually just dressed up dumb snippets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134315</guid></item><item><title>21.

I remember the code was written in BASIC and my family didn't really own a computer back then.Fast forward a few years later I saw this "Visual Basic" thing and thought it would be similar ... it was, but only sort of. I had no book to learn from at first so I remember clicking through every single menu and button available to see what it did. Then I remember using our dialup to download every possible 3rd party VB form control and throwing them in a Form to see what they did. I don't know why I found this entertaining enough to keep doing it.Eventually by copy pasting and changing stuff I was able to write some basic "homework helper" programs: calculate the area of a circle and stuff like that. Soon after I tried to look up tutorials which taught me basic win32 programming to do things like have an icon in the status area next to the clock, and then hiding my window to run in the background and make annoying sounds so I could build a silly little prank program to install on my friend's computers which was fun but often would fail because they were missing some .dll file which wouldn't fit on the same floppy.It could be frustrating at times but also I feel so blessed to have lucked myself into learning programming this way and my parents pretty much just letting me do whatever I wanted to this expensive device that probably was not a small thing for us to afford at the time.Even tutorials felt more fun at the time, it'd be "hypnoMan37's windows registry tutorial!!! HEyyeyeyy Guuyzs :-)))) gzgzgz to my irc channel #blabla on EFNet! so first you call RegistryCreateNewKey32(...." because god knows I did not have an MSDN CD either.Learning via a code camp feels way more efficient but also so much more dry in comparison. I wonder if there isn't a substantial cost to boring the newbies to death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an awesomely inspirational vision, but within 2 minutes of trying it out I found it's lacking a lot of little features (at least on the web build)...  e.g:Ampersands in button labels don't create an accelerator (e.g. &amp;Go does not underline the G).In true VB6 you could plop down a Label control and just start typing to change it's contents.  Here you have to focus on the input field first (and you can't just click the "Caption" heading, you have to click within the input column).  To maintain fidelity, one of the rows in the Properties grid should always be highlighted when a control is selected on the GUI designer (for Labels this defaulted to Caption, and I believe for controls without a specified default it defaulted to Name).When switching to a different control with a property matching the name of the currently selected one, VB6 would maintain the selection on that property.  This made it quick and easy to update for example the Tag property a bunch of controls in sequence with minimal clicks.Obviously the menus for Debugging, Save, Help, Add-ins, etc. are missing implementation.A working Build button that spits out an "exectuable" that runs in the browser would be killer!My nitpicks are born out of love ;-).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141587</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is amazing how well iOS supports these accessibility features but doesn't consider blocking video autoplay on websites, something that is incredibly distracting for people with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing how good eye tracking works on my phone (15 Pro).Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to press buttons via blinking, only by "dwelling" on an item for a few seconds, which makes using my phone feel quite hectic and prone to to inadvertent inputs to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor tracks ok, but the implementation seems to replace a low-level pointing device.  I.e., it's very precise and jittery - all attribution and no salience.Also maybe like Siri it should be modal.  E.g., dwell away to silence, and then dwell leading corner to say "Hey, listen..."Holding the phone seemed to cause problems ("you're not holding it right").  Probably best with fixed positioning, e.g., attached to a screen (like a continuity camera, assuming you're lying down with a fixed head position.Tracking needs a magnetic (gravity well?) behavior, where the pointer is drawn to UI features (and the user can retract by resisting).  Salience weighting could make it quite useful.It's possible that weighting could piggyback on existing accessibility metadata, or it might require a different application programming model.Similarly, it would be interesting to combine it with voice input that prioritized things near where you are looking.I'm willing to try, and eager to see how it gets integrated with other features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42104378</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;New York City is close to eliminating controversial broker fees that financially burden renters, following a proposed law aimed at preventing landlords from charging these fees to tenants. The move is part of a broader effort to protect renters amidst rising housing costs and increasing demands for affordable housing. Advocates argue that these fees create significant barriers for individuals seeking housing, while landlords and brokers warn that banning these fees may negatively impact the rental market. The legislation, if passed, could significantly change the dynamics of rental transactions in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130281"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a win for price competition - the "broker fee" paid by the renter is a classic example of principal agent problems / information asymmetry.First, the service is being provided to the landlord (listing, tours, etc.), not the client, for all listings these days (I don't know any young person who has ever used a renter's agent, except maybe if it's provided in a relocation package). The renter has no choice in which broker to use to find/transact w/ the property, so there's very little price pressure for these broker fees.Second the information asymmetry - the terms of the fee are completely opaque in the listings, and are not disclosed basically until signing unless you press brokers earlier. So there's basically no competitive pressure pushing these fees down, since it's basically a "junk fee" from a user experience perspective tacked on at the very end (and not listed on listings), and the landlord - who IS in a position to negotiate on price - doesn't care.I don't buy the argument that there will be some long-term price hike in rents as a result of this decision - people who rent for 1-5 years already are paying a MASSIVE "net effective" premium for having an additional month's rent tacked on up front - but also it strongly incentivizes tenant retention (e.g. by being more responsive, keeping prices lower, etc.), because the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker's fee next listing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Links to parts of today's NYC Council meeting where this passed today --- The Speaker, Adrienne Adams, talks about the bill here: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...- The prime sponsor, Chi Ossé's, comments on the bill:  https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...- A vocal opposing voice, Vickie Paladino's, comments on the bill: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany effectively banned broker fees in 2015 with the "Bestellerprinzip": the person who hired the agent pays for the agent. In most cases, this means the landlord. The fee is also capped to 2x the cold rent (before utilities).You also can't charge an agent fee for merely giving someone access to a database, and you can't be both the agent and the landlord, nor the agent and the previous tenant.Unfortunately, the difficult housing market ended up creating all sorts of other bribes. The most common is the previous tenant selling their furniture for an exhorbitant fee, or straight up requesting a bribe. These are obviously illegal, and you would be entitled to keep the apartment even after getting your money back in court. However rights are of little importance if you don't have the time/energy/means to enforce them. It's also a bad way to start a relationship with a landlord.German law is firmly on the side of tenants, but sometimes the greed is just too strong, and there is an endless supply of applicants who are willing to compromise.More info here: https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/housing-scams#scams-by-lan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130281</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We found the same result a few years ago in our ICLR paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14500We found Google's T5 models which were released in 2019, pre-GPT-3, were "secretly" capable of in-context learning with a simple inference technique.Given they use a bidirectional MLM (Masked Language Modeling) objective, it wasn't obvious how to do it, but MLM objectives are known to produce better language representations than causal (next token prediction) objectives. We were able to outperform much larger sized GPT-3 models or get very close to their performance with far smaller T5 models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "embarrassingly simple inference technique" is to put a bunch of [MASK] tokens at the end of the prompt.I'm having trouble understanding whether this paper is saying anything new. The original BERT paper already compared it favourably to causal models including GPT. Was there any doubt that BERT-style models could be in-context learners?From what I gather as a non-expert, the problem with BERT is scaling/training efficiency: GPT gets C-1 training examples out of a training input of length C, but BERT only gets 0.15*C examples. Indeed, the author points out that DeBERTa required 3x more compute than GPT-3 to achieve the level of performance reported, which makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has very limited understanding but tried to use BERT for classification, is BERT still relavant when compared to LLMs ? Asking because I hardly see any mention of BERTs anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134125</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the negative impact of cookie banners on user productivity and website usability. It highlights how these mandatory notifications can disrupt user experience, slow down website interactions, and ultimately drive users away. The piece emphasizes the need for website owners to streamline the consent process and adopt less intrusive methods while remaining compliant with privacy regulations. It advocates for a balance between legal obligations and user experience to enhance overall engagement and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am kind of frustrated by the widespread misunderstandings in this thread.Laws are best when they are abstract, so that there is no need for frequent updates and they adapt to changing realities. The European "cookie law" does not mandate cookie banners, it mandates informed consent. Companies choose to implement that as a banner.There is no doubt that the goals set by the law are sensible. It is also not evident that losing time over privacy is so horrible. In fact, when designing a law that enhances consumer rights through informed consent, it is inevitable that this imposes additional time spent on thinking, considering and acting.It's the whole point, folks! You cannot have an informed case-by-case decision without spending time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole law should have been forcing sites to not ignore DoNotTrack bworser settings. It's a prime example of the EU being utterly useless because they don't understand the underlying issue and then choose a "solution" that's as much in your face as possible but doesn't change anything about the original problem. It's the whole plastic straw thing in digital form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hop into your uBlock Origin settings and enable the Cookie Banner filters. Fixed. Enable the Annoyances filters too, while you're in there.If you're on iOS, the Kill Sticky bookmarklet does a decent job of cleaning these up without breaking most sites: https://www.smokingonabike.com/2024/01/20/take-back-your-web...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141843</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;NASA is exploring the potential of laser beam welding in a vacuum environment as a method for manufacturing components in space. This investigation aims to enhance the ability to create and repair structures in orbit, which could be crucial for future space missions. By using laser technology, NASA seeks to develop efficient manufacturing processes that can operate in the unique conditions of outer space, ultimately contributing to longer-term human presence and activities in space.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent breakthrough is a welding head which creates a local vacuum around the welding area, rather than putting the whole object into a vacuum chamber. This allows automated welding of big, thick objects, all the way up to nuclear reactor pressure vessels.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSD5izdUyY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good example of a space-based research initiative that might find significant applications on Earth.I think the key reason that space-based research tends to be so technologically fruitful is that it imposes a discipline on the science done, through the constraints that space imposes on meeting ambitious mission objectives.Space initiatives also provide a justification for doing the kind of blue skies research that might otherwise find difficulty finding funding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103314</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and significance of Gopher, a pre-World Wide Web internet protocol developed in Minnesota in the early 1990s. It highlights Gopher’s role in organizing and providing access to online information through a menu-based system, its rapid popularity among users, and its eventual decline with the rise of the World Wide Web. The piece also reflects on the cultural impact of Gopher and its legacy in shaping internet navigation, while introducing characters related to its development, such as key figures involved in its creation and evolution. Overall, it serves as a nostalgic look back at an important but often overlooked chapter in the history of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gopher was how I first got on the Internet in 1991. Cleveland FreeNet (like an Internet BBS) supported connecting to other FreeNets and Buffalo FreeNet had gopher. I searched lots of ftp sites, read lots.  You also had 1.5MB of space you could use to download software to temporarily on Buffalo FreeNet. With gopher, two freenets, and zmodem, I downloaded and installed my first Linux system in 1992: 0.95a running on a 386sx16 with 4mb of memory and a 40mb HD. Gopher opened up the Internet when I was a kid in high school and the web wasn’t a thing. I’ll forever be grateful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; At GopherCon 1993, it was announced that Gopher servers would need to pay for the privilege of using the protocol... Well, that didn’t work out. People were angry and many felt betrayed. They weren’t quiet about any of it either.&gt; If one were to attempt to identify a single failure of Gopher in competition with the web, it would be the licensing costs. No such fee existed for the World Wide Web.This, a thousand times. I watched as this happened. The instant that announcement was made, gopher was finished. Gopher might have lost later as HTML kept adding features, but by the time those features were added to HTML, gopher had already lost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that Gopher just failed to keep up with the times.  Embedding images into the page was a killer feature for HTML and Gopher was still doggedly text based because they were still supporting the VT100 users that had been the core userbase.  Plus the web went on to support text formatting, tables, and even eventually layout.The article isn't entirely correct about the early web being completely free.  Netscape was not free software, at least on paper.  In practice they didn't try to stop people from spreading it far and wide and I think the sales were somewhat modest despite being the core element of a technological revolution.  Also, I guess NCSA Mosiac was technically around, but it lacked enough features to make it a second class citizen compared to Netscape Navigator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106368</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Red Hat announces its contribution of a comprehensive collection of container tools to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), aimed at enhancing the ecosystem for cloud-native development. This initiative includes tools such as Podman, Skopeo, and Buildah, which facilitate container image management, building, and sharing. By integrating these tools into CNCF's projects, Red Hat seeks to support and foster community collaboration while improving the overall development experience for cloud-native applications. The move underscores Red Hat's commitment to open-source innovation and the advancement of cloud-native technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Podman actually works really well. Out-of-the-box virtually-no-configuration-needed rootless containers. It's also usable via docker-compose with a single env variable. (podman-compose wasn't up to par for us)We've been using it for a couple of years running and managing hundreds of containers per server - no feeling of flakiness whatsoever. It's virtually zeroconf and even supports GPUs for those who need it. It's like docker but better, IMO.Hope it gets a popularity boost from CNCF. Rooting for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To all those interested in podman, this book by Daniel Walsh is a gem. Highly recommended and it is free.https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/podman-action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is CNCF new Apache foundation? Looks like everyone dumps their stuff there. Does not look promising. Am I missing something? Probably RedHat paid salary to podman developers, but who will pay salary to them now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42139044</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue of overcharges within the Amplify platform, detailing how users can experience unexpected fees. It outlines the circumstances that lead to these overcharges, offers insights into user experiences, and provides potential solutions to avoid such charges. The author emphasizes the importance of transparency and communication from service providers to prevent misunderstandings regarding billing and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Billing alerts" are a joke, give us hard spend limits. Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It's also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, "I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life's savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they're coming for my house", the less they'll want to explore your offerings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it’s minor in comparison, but I will never use AWS again after running up a $100 bill trying to get an app deployed to ECS. There was an error (on my side) preventing the service from starting up, but cloud waatch only had logs about 20% of the time, so I had to redeploy five times just to get some logs, make changes, redeploy five more times, etc. They charged me for every single failed deploy.After about two days of struggling and a $100 bill, I said fuck it, deleted my account and deployed to DigitalOcean’s app platform instead, where it also failed to deploy (the error was with my app), but I had logs, every time. I fixed it in and had it running in under ten minutes, total bill was a few cents.I swore that day that I would never again use AWS for anything when given a choice, and would never recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a glaring bug in the scripts run by that `npx` command. The author is correct, the scripts should 100%:- Choose the lowest cost resource (it's a tutorial!)- Cleanup resources when the `delete` subscript is runI don't think it's fair to expect developers to do paranoid sweeps of their entire AWS account looking for rogue resources after running something like this.If a startup had this behavior would you shrug and say "this happens, you just have to be paranoid"? Why is AWS held to a different standard by some?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133700</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a vulnerability in Ubuntu that allows for root privilege escalation due to improper handling of specific files and permissions. It outlines the technical details of the exploit, including how attackers can manipulate certain environment variables to gain elevated privileges. The author emphasizes the importance of security practices, such as keeping systems updated and monitoring for unusual activity, to mitigate the risks associated with such vulnerabilities. Additionally, it highlights the broader implications of privilege escalation attacks and encourages developers and sysadmins to adopt preventive measures to protect their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Technically correct, but impractical at best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was a great read. The way the author builds the exploit, brick by brick, is well done and not all all obvious or clear.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a fine balance between Not Invented Here syndrome vs. trying to hammer the square peg of off-the-shelf OSS into the round hole of the actual problem you're trying to solve.For example they suggest ROS as a robust industry-ready software, which absolutely hasn't been my experience: you hire a bunch of domain experts to solve the various [hardware, controls, perception, imaging, systems] problems, but once you use ROS as your middleware you end up needing a bunch of ROS experts instead. This is due to the horrible build system, odd choice of defaults, instability under constrained resources, and how it inserts itself into everything. You end up needing more fine-grained control than ROS gives you to make an actually robust system, but by the time you discover this you'll be so invested into ROS that switching away will involve a full rewrite.The same goes for further downstream: OpenCV images are basically a void* with a bunch of helper functions. (4.x tried to help with this but got sideswiped by DNN before anything concrete could happen.)I guess it's the same rant the FreeBSD people have about the Linux ecosystem and its reliability. However I'd hope we raise our standards when it comes to mobile robotics that have the potential to accidentally seriously hurt people. And who knows, maybe one day OpenCV and ROS will pleasantly surprise me the way Linux has with its progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linguistic tangent: when did "learnings" oust "lessons" as the standard word for "things I have learned"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article struck a personal note with me because around the same time (2008-2012) I was really getting into vision, and even got published as an undergrad for imaging sensor fusion work (...my first, only, and likely last only meaningful contribution to my species); while the wider MV/CV community was making incremental gains every few years (anyone else remember Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients?), that's what they were: incremental (I also remember my research-supervisor recounting how the patent on SIFT probably held back the entire field by a decade or two, so yes - things were slow-moving......until a few years ago when:&gt; Computer vision has been consumed by AI....but "AI" is an unsatisfying reduction. What does it even mean? (and c'mon, plenty of non-NN CV techniques going back decades can be called "AI" today with a straight-face (for example, an adaptive pixel+contour histogram model for classifying very specific things).My point is that computer-vision, as a field, *is* (an) artificial-intelligence: it has not been "consumed by AI". I don't want ephemeral fad terminology (y'know... buzzwords) getting in the way of what could have been a much better article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078674</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to put out a ghost job req and interview every person applying within reason for every green card a direct report is applying for. I have to show there are or aren’t any residents or citizens that can fill the jobThe main problem is: even if the interviewee knocks it out of the park, is an amazing engineer, I still am not interested in firing my OPT/h1b team member who can still legally work for 2-3 years. So while I will deny their green card application and not submit it, I also won’t hire the interviewee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The trend could be due to the low marginal cost of posting additional job ads and to maintain a pipeline of talents. After adjusting for yearly trends, I find that ghost jobs can explain the recent disconnect in the Beveridge Curve in the past fifteen years. The results show that policy-makers should be aware of such a practice as it causes significant job fatigue and distorts market signals.Very interesting.I certainly have "gotten" what I thought was a ghost job.   I went through the whole process ... they "wanted" to hire me.  But didn't actually have a start date / couldn't actually hire me.  For everyone involved though they seemed to be able to justify posting the job, interviews, because IMO, it made THEM look busy / effective.The whole hiring people industrial complex seems oriented to be focused on the process of hiring (high fives for ever more complex hiring processes / delays) ... and not at all on the outcome (did we hire someone, were they good?).It's the ultimate system where simply doing anything is "success" / and more processes rewarded, and there's almost no good measureless about outcomes for the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hang on a minute. There is absolutely nothing in this research that measures the accuracy of this approach. A user saying "I was ghosted" is not, to my mind, proof of anything.Job seekers almost never actually know if the job was real or not, so it's hard to see how Glassdoor reviews can ever provide the insight this work is looking for.I do believe that "ghost" jobs exist, often for H1B purposes, but I don't think this work proves it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136469</guid></item><item><title>35.

It seems like they've added a few things since this draft.It's somewhat funny to hear "minimum viable product" in the context of a language standard/specification. I'd never thought of adding a feature to a language in that way before.The idea of design by contract (DbC) in C++ appears to have been around for a while too. The authors link to a "forthcoming companion paper" (currently a 404 error), but you can find proposals from as early as 2004 with the idea: https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2004/n16...(and potentially earlier, I just haven't seen one yet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did my dissertation work on software contracts. They are generally useless: programmers won't write them, or will write them incorrectly. Moreover, the runtime enforcement dominates all but the most-expensive functions, and contracts become an antipattern for helper functions due to their enforcement cost.Without intense compiler support and contract erasure such as David Van Horne's work, this is a dead idea that needs to stay that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contract programming for C++ was implemented back in the 90's.https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/contract.htmlIt also appears in the D programming language:https://dlang.org/spec/contracts.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42131473</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;GOG has launched a preservation program aimed at reviving classic DRM-free games, signaling a shift in its focus towards preserving gaming history. The initiative includes efforts to update and re-release older titles, making them more accessible to new audiences while maintaining their original charm. This approach emphasizes the importance of preserving video game culture and history amidst the rapid technological advancements in the gaming industry. GOG's strategy suggests a commitment to ensuring that classic games remain playable and relevant in today's market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know. I wish for them to succeed but as someone who's had a GOG account since before it officially launched, I have seen them claim to refocus on classics at least twice before, with meager effects. It's gotten bad enough that some games ostensibly under GOG's mission are actually better off on Steam and I don't think it's entirely on the publisher.The examples chosen to hightlight the program on gog's own page for this initiative also do not fill with confidence. If you read between the lines it turns out that for instance it took them five years (!) to fix a crashing HoMM3 intro in a language they added, and likewise they only checked if Diablo/Hellfire even works on win 10/11 yesterday, years after they started selling it.More power to them, if they keep at it, but I don't see anything to get excited over yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have flip-flopped between GOG and Steam for many years. This has correlated with my use of Linux and Linux's support for gaming.When I first learned of GOG and I was still primarily gaming on Windows I tended to choose GOG over Steam since I prefer their DRM-free games. However since it became much easier to game on Linux (thanks to Proton and the work of Valve), I tended to start buying more on Steam since it was so much easier to get games working through their platform. Since Heroic launcher came out I have now switched back to primarily buying from GOG again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good initiative to make it easier to run old games and simplifying the effort involved in making them fit modern monitors and operating systems.I hope we see them more focused on preserving access to the games too, they've talked before about how until copyright is reformed we need to use the justice system to inherit accounts and the games in them, hopefully some of their efforts are focused on that reform especially now that the EU is investigating whether we should "own" our digital libraries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133624</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The project "json.cpp" on GitHub is a C++ library designed for parsing and serializing JSON data effectively and simply. It emphasizes minimal dependencies, easy integration, and a straightforward API for handling JSON structures in C++. The repository includes documentation, examples, and the source code to facilitate usage and customization for developers looking to work with JSON in their C++ applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember searching for a JSON library with minimal dependencies a while ago, and came across this:https://rawgit.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark/master/sampl...The variance in feature set, design and performance is huge across all of them. I ultimately landed on libjson, written in C: https://github.com/vincenthz/libjsonIt does a lot for you, but it notably does not build a tree for you and does not try to interpret numbers, which I found perfect for adding to languages with C FFI that have their own collection and number types. It’s also great for partial parsing if you need to do any sort of streaming.It looks like this one can’t currently do partial parsing, but it looks great if C++ maps/vectors are your target.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compile time is largely a "developer problem", but so is the usability of a library.  nlohmann/json's main perk that it is selling is that it's interface is usable.  Whether or not a developer values usability at typing time vs compile time is an interesting thing to ponder for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting that nlohmann isn't fully compliant. What cases are these?It seems to me though that if you're encountering the edges of json where nlohmann or simple parsing doesn't work properly, a binary format might be better.

Magnetometers are our main tool for detecting presence of a saline ocean in planets and moons (Enceladus, Triton, Europa), and characterizing it. The Uranus measurement is a template for this technique.Several of the co authors are on the Europa Clipper magnetometer team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113315</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The discussion centers around improving C interoperability in Swift through the use of non-escapable types and lifetimes, aiming to enhance safety and efficiency in memory management. Participants explore the implications of such a system for both Swift and C developers, including how it can help avoid common pitfalls associated with pointers and memory leaks. The forum exchange includes various technical proposals, potential benefits, and challenges of implementing non-escapable types, ultimately seeking to create a more robust and performant interoperability model between the two programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recent Swift updates add increasingly niche and theoretical features that are of questionable practical use.Meanwhile the compiler still can't compile many even mildly complex SwiftUI views and expressions with the "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" error.It does not even tell you what part of code it is having issues with so you could change it. You have to comment/uncomment blocks of code to find the problematic part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple wants to migrate away from C++, including code in the kernel, so they need a safe, low-overhead language.Swift has originally been designed as an ObjC replacement, mostly for UI glue code, with conveniences more like a scripting language.So now they're working on making Swift support more low-level low-overhead code.https://youtu.be/lgivCGdmFrw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very similar to C#'s `ref struct` (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-ref...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42082808</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Origin Private File System (OPFS), a part of the File System Access API that enables web applications to read and write files in a private file system specific to an origin. It emphasizes that OPFS allows secure and efficient handling of local files directly in a user's browser environment, ensuring that files are isolated and not accessible to other origins. The content covers the API's features, usage guidelines, and examples of how developers can use it to interact with the file system while maintaining user privacy and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my perspective, the biggest flaw in FireFox is that it does not support the File System Access API.Because with it, we can offer users to hold their data natively on their devices. Instead of storing everything in the cloud.Chrome on the desktop supports it. Here is a demo:https://googlechromelabs.github.io/text-editor/A text editor that works just like a native application.And mobile support is also in the making:https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40101963I can't wait to use this in my web applications. Finally a way to build proper tools in the browser.The "Origin private file system" that this story links to is just like the infamous IndexDB. Something that the user cannot backup, cannot use in other software and that is only kept around for as long as FireFox feels like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a couple webapps where I needed to use the FS API (which allows users to provide real, accessible folders to a webapp, unlike OPFS).I can't understand why anyone would want to use OPFS or what problems it solves that a slim interface over IndexDB wouldn't provide. The only use I've had for it has been a almost-ok substitute for the actual FS API (given its the same interface), but since the goal is to allow users to have easy access to your webapp's data, it has to be paired with a cumbersome import/export feature for browsers that only have OPFS.I guess it's probably more performant for FS-like queries (like listing the contents of a directory...), but that performance benefit (for me at least) seems secondary to giving users control over the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels a lot like giving companies a way to store data on my device without me being in control of that data. If your web app is going to store data, I want the power to audit that data, not have the browser go "oh, sorry, can't let you do that, that would hurt someone else's bottom line".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137790</guid></item><item><title>44.

If your company is too cheap for that, maybe a PR would have been nice?Having very high expectations when using the software without contributing anything else than public shaming on something that clearly state in the license: "Licensor provides the Work ...

A failure in the code, logic or at the seams messes up everything that it tries to protect. There are a few big commercial players trying to take the market with their "social login", and a few smaller (open-source) players trying to compete and survive, walking a fine line between open-source and open-core.I feel this is one avenue where a few open-source players should get some solid funding and support from both the organisations and governments that use their software so we don't end up with unmaintained bug-riddled code and have to login with Google or Facebook everywhere.A lot of the government agencies I work with use open-source IdP software (because they have to privacy- and policy-wise), so some healthy funding model should be possible for people with the skill and interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there good alternatives in 2024 to Keycloak + FreeIPA for k8s-native environments?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136000</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing linkages between ML and Differential Geometry is intriguing (to say the least). But I have this nagging sense that "data manifolds" are too rigidly tied to numerical representations for this program to flourish. Differential geometry is all about invariance. Geometric objects have a life of their own so to speak, irrespective of any particular representation. In the broader data science world such an internal structure is not accessible in general. The systems modeled are too complex and their capture in data too superficial to be a reflection of the "true state". In a sense this is analogous to the "blind men touching a elephant in different parts and disagreeing about what it is".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135314</guid></item><item><title>47.

It features interviews with various individuals involved in its creation, including band members, producers, and critics, who share their perspectives on the song's release, commercial success, and the backlash it faced.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason, this mention of Starship's "We Built This City" led me down a hole of Internet research on my own personal Mandala Effect rabbit hole. I remembered as a kid, the Residents - who I only knew at the time as a bunch of guys wearing eyeballs as their heads - being part of the video for "We Built This City". I later became a fan of the Residents, who hadn't mentioned this at all. No evidence of them appearing with Starship, including the video for "We Built this City". But I hadn't been able to shake this vision for decades. Did I imagine it?Tonight, digging deeper, I found it! I found the source. In 1984, just a year before "We Built this City", Jefferson Starship (the progenitor of Starship, we won't mention the Airplane here) released a video for their ostensible hit single "Layin' it on the Line".There they were! The Residents! In a terrible, terrible Jefferson Starship video! Sung by Grace Slick and, uh, that dude from Starship!Strangely, I'll be able to sleep deeply tonight knowing that this mystery that was knawing at my soul for so many years has finally been solved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of a worst song of all time is silly, but I want to use this as an excuse  to juxtapose We Built this City with another Starship hit: Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now. The latter is just as fluffy and corny, but instead of generic corporate rock it's a soaring silly power ballad duet.I think the secret sauce is Diane Warren. It's the same reason I love belting out I Don't Want to Miss a Thing at karaoke, or listening to If I Could Turn Back Time on a loop while working.This post has been sponsored by the Committee to Get Diane Warren into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (CGDWRRHF).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what universe is "We built this City" the worst song ever? I love that song. Awesome bit of 80s power pop.I'd rather hear We built this City 10 times in a row than any 10 songs of Taylor Swift's. How about that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133282</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenMP ARB has announced the release of OpenMP 6.0, which aims to simplify parallel programming for developers. This new version introduces several features and enhancements, including improvements in tasking and support for more complex data structures, making it easier to write efficient and scalable parallel applications. OpenMP 6.0 focuses on enhancing usability and performance while maintaining compatibility with previous versions, thereby streamlining the development process in high-performance computing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenMP is one of the easiest ways to make existing code run across CPU cores. In the simplest cases you simply add a single #pragma to C code and it goes N times faster. This is when you're running a function in a loop with no side effects. Some examples I've done:1) ray tracing. Looping over all the pixels in an image using ray tracing to determine the color of each pixel. The algorithm and data structures are complex but don't change during the rendering. N cores is about N times as fast.2) in Solvespace we had a small loop which calls a tessellation function on a bunch of NURBS surfaces. The function was appending triangles to a list, so I made a thread-local list for each call and combined them after to avoid writes to shared data structure. Again N times faster with very little effort.The code is also fine to build single threaded without change if you don't have OpenMP. Your compiler will just ignore the #pragmas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now (already in OpenMP5) use it to write GPU programs. Intels OneAPI uses OpenMP 5.5 to write programs for the Intel PonteVecchio GPUs which are on par to the Nvidia A100.https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/optimiza...gcc also provides support for NVidia and AMD GPUshttps://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OffloadingHere is an example how you can use openmp for running a kernel on a nvidia A100:https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/INFO0939/notes/...  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;omp.h&gt;

  void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  double elapsed = -1.0 \* omp_get_wtime();

  // We don't need to map the variable a as scalars are firstprivate by default
  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for map(to:x[0:n]) map(tofrom:y[0:n])
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }

  elapsed += omp_get_wtime();
  printf("saxpy done in %6.3lf seconds.\n", elapsed);
  }

  int main() {
  int n = 2000000;
  float *x = (float*) malloc(n*sizeof(float));
  float *y = (float*) malloc(n*sizeof(float));
  float alpha = 2.0;

  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
     x[i] = 1;
     y[i] = i;
  }

  saxpy(n, alpha, x, y);

  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
  }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenMP was pivotal to my last workplace, but because some customers required MSVC, we barely had support for OpenMP 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42139843</guid></item><item><title>49.

I'm more of the mindset that writing something like this is probably a code smell to begin with. Is there any reason I'm not thinking of right now, that this couldn't be typedef'd and refactored into something far more readable?C gets a lot of blame for pointer gibberish like this but quite honestly you can write gibberish in any language. I don't see any fundamental or technical reason you couldn't write clean, readable C.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use typedef?Granted, the function pointer syntax is forever confusing (to me anyway). The rest is easily tackled by naming things.Even for function pointers, it’s just one lookup and then you can copy-paste the typedef for any other function pointer types in the project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a language that's substantially free of gibberish?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110159</guid></item><item><title>50.

If you are a highly-experienced language developer, the fixes are likely to be a lot more obvious, simpler, more comprehensive, and robust, than if you are a relatively junior IC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I'd really like is for PHP to somehow be stricter on the number of arguments passed to a function.As of now, PHP emits an error if arguments are missing but not if there are too many.A way to bake that in without breaking old code would be to allow function definition to put an explicit stop to the argument list, for example using the void type keyword:    function foo (int $a, string $b, void) : bool
    { ... }


A few month ago I discussed this on the development mailing list and people seemed to agree and even suggested that this would be a good idea by default without the keyword thing I suggested. But I never got the time to properly write an RFC. There is already an old one from years ago that was voted against but In was told it was from before anything strict and typing related was considered important in PHP. If anyone's up to it, please write this RFC :) !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42063617</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built it and tried it out a bit with Godot on Linux. It seems OK (the UI is a bit on the "- how many widgets do you want? - yes" side), but also a bit janky. Trying to change the font for the editor didn't work, hovering over a variable to see its value either does nothing (but there is a sub-second cursor change that indicates something is supposed to happen) or it shows an error from GDB about trying to use an expression with a type or keyword (so there was an intent to show a value on a tooltip, it is just broken) - doubleclicking on a variable does add it in some panel with its current value and a timestamp, so the functionality for reading values/expressions from the UI is there too, just not done in the same way as the tooltips.If polished a bit it could be useful, though from all the frontends i've tried the one i disliked the least (none are great) is Gede[0] (which i just noticed had a new release a few hours ago) as it has a very simple and straightforward UI and while it doesn't expose much functionality, what exposes seem to work fine without bugs.[0] https://gede.dexar.se/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDB also has a built-in text user interface (TUI) that is surprisingly easy to use[1]. It even supports mouse interaction.[1] https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/TUI.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After trying many frontends for gdb I find that the TUI is the best. You just need to know about Ctrl + L to redraw if your program is printing stuff because the interface then become garbled.I just put :   layout src
   set confirm off

in my $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146338</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article commemorates the life and contributions of Thomas E. Kurtz, who passed away in 2024 at the age of 95. Kurtz was a pioneering computer scientist best known for co-developing the BASIC programming language in the 1960s, which greatly influenced computer education and accessibility. The post highlights his achievements, including his role at Dartmouth College and his efforts in promoting programming as an essential skill for students. It reflects on Kurtz's impact on the computing field and his legacy in making technology more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;96! Lived a full life. RIP.I wrote a lot of QBASIC. 1986-90ish, old Bangalore. I was 12. There was no Mac or Unix or Windows in India those days. Only MSDOS. I had a 386 box. I would insert a 5.25" floppy, boot into command.com, then CD to GWBASIC.EXE and enter GWBASIC. Wrote a lot of GWBASIC to annoy friends and family by emitting high pitched sounds. You could do SOUND 2000+i, j, where i is the frequency &amp; j was duration. You could even control volume from BASIC. I would put that in a WHILE WEND loop and make it go crazy. People didn't know how to turn it off once it got going. Then suddenly one day DOS went away and we had something called MS WINDOWS 3.1 and you had to insert a white round ball into a mouse and click on icons, no more command line, and even GWBASIC was gone, they put QBASIC and it came with snake program. Then I got into the graphics craze. We had a CGA &amp; so I did SCREEN 2, then used LINE and CIRCLE to my heart's content. Few colors only. Then we upgraded to VGA monitor then SCREEN 12 was a full 640x480, I wrote QBASIC to make annoying sounds while drawing. It was an amazing childhood, thanks to this miracle language. BASIC led to something called CLIPPER, then I did some FOXPRO, got paid actual rupees to write an inventory control system in FOXPRO, then MFC, Borland C++...all the way upto today.But it all started with BASIC. Amazing language. Thank you, Dr. Kurtz.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I originally learned to program with BASIC. When I was designing D, I thought back to how easy and natural string manipulation was in BASIC, and what a festering swamp of bugs it was in C.Having strings as easy and correct in D was a major priority, and history has shown that this was a success.P.S. Whenever I review C code, I first look at the string manipulation. The probability of finding a bug in it is near certainty. Question for the people who disagree - without looking it up, how does strncpy() deal with 0 termination?Thank you, Thomas Kurtz!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The legacy of BASIC is outstanding.  I learned BASIC because there's a BASIC ROM in the hardware of the Atari 800XL that I was fortunate to have access to when I was very young.  The language was easy enough to pick up from sample programs in the back of its instruction manual, even for a kid who didn't know anyone who knew anything about computers.I never met Kurtz personally but I owe a lot to that language for the access to virtually limitless creativity that computers and computer programming have offered.  My life would be very different if I didn't have the opportunity that the language provided, especially because it is both approachable and (somewhat) capable.Sure, it's not the best language for large scale or complex efforts, but it was enough for a child to be able to build text adventures and blit pixels to the screen (it would be another decade before I found out that INT was about interrupt, not integers).  Then, as a teenager fooling around with writing games for the class calculators in TI-BASIC, even though that's a bit farther down the language family tree, that also had a positive impact on my growth as a developer and it was the first of many "same but different" experiences that you so often get in the realm of programming.  I was also quite fortunate, that launched an early game dev career for me.To be honest, I wouldn't have recognized the name Thomas E. Kurtz before yesterday, but my mind will light up with dozens of fond memories at the mention of BASIC.  I'm not surprised that he was so involved in instructional computing (but I am surprised I never looked into the author(s) of BASIC before, a little ashamed, but I'll remember his name).  I actually still have the same Atari 800XL from my childhood and I'll think of him when I see it now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141761</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of chess as a mentally stimulating game that promotes strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. It highlights the rise of online chess platforms, the impact of popular personalities on the game's popularity, and the importance of community engagement and learning resources.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the article neglects one obvious possibility: that OpenAI decided that chess was a benchmark worth "winning", special-cases chess within gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, and then neglected to add that special-case to follow-up models since it wasn't generating sustained press coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Important testing excerpts:- "...for the closed (OpenAI) models I tried generating up to 10 times and if it still couldn’t come up with a legal move, I just chose one randomly."- "I ran all the open models (anything not from OpenAI, meaning anything that doesn’t start with gpt or o1) myself using Q5_K_M quantization"- "...if I gave a prompt like “1. e4 e5 2. ” (with a space at the end), the open models would play much, much worse than if I gave a prompt like “1 e4 e5 2.” (without a space)"- "I used a temperature of 0.7 for all the open models and the default for the closed (OpenAI) models."Between the tokenizer weirdness, temperature, quantization, random moves, and the chess prompt, there's a lot going on here. I'm unsure how to interpret the results. Fascinating article though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's probably worth to play around with different prompts and different board positions.For context this [1] is the board position the model is being prompted on.There may be more than one weird thing about this experiment, for example giving instructions to the non-instruction tuned variants may be counter productive.More importantly let's say you just give the model the truncated PGN, does this look like a position where white is a grandmaster level player? I don't think so. Even if the model understood chess really well it's going to try to predict the most probable move given the position at hand, if the model thinks that white is a bad player, and the model is good at understanding chess, it's going to predict bad moves as the more likely ones because that would better predict what is most likely to happen here.[1]: https://i.imgur.com/qRxalgH.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138289</guid></item><item><title>5.

The team has now become https://unison.co/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It isn't a $200 headset. It's a headset you have to build yourself (including 3D printing and soldering) with $200 worth of parts.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had launched something like this in 2016. We had called it as ering.me, so you could have an url like ering.me/handle. Used it in email signatures, web calling etc. It didn't pick up at that time or we didn't market enough :)Hope the market is mature now and products like this succeed. All the best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small thing that might be useful: allow users to get a regular phone number to call. Most users probably won't need it, some will, and when they need it and there's no number, it's extremely frustrating for the (potential or current) customer.Example: in most cases, I don't have a microphone or headset on my office desktop PC (don't need it, we don't do zooms), have very slow internet access on my smartphone (forget OnAir calling with it, and anyway it would be too much friction to reopen the same web page on it just to call), but have a very well working landline phone nearby.One possibility you might think about is to get a VoIP number terminated at your server (and possibly a free 1-800-xxxx but those don't necessarily work from abroad), where people can call, enter a code displayed by the OnAir client in the web page (like an extension ID, but it might be random if there's a value in obliging people to come to the web page before calling, e.g. to limit spam calling), and once done they'd be connected as if they were calling through the web page. The limitation with this solution here is that you'd need a number for each country you want to support, as international calls easily get expensive, especially from mobile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great example of something complex made very simple to the end user. A lot of thought clearly went into the UX.

Linux, or at least not this Linux, won't let you use a swapfile hosted over NFS; swapon will give you an illegal argument error and refuse to enable it.To my shock, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device says&gt; The protocol was originally developed for Linux 2.1.55 and released in 1997.so I wonder if you could use that? It's better suited to swap anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From all the variants mentioned across the comments, the PS2Linux was the best one, being officially supported by Sony.Originally they had though as a means to foster indie development, instead people got to use it for emulation, thus PS3 Linux Other OS no longer supported graphics acceleration, and then was completly dropped in a firmware upgrade.On the PS2, we had official Linux CDs from Sony, a hard drive, connection cables, and a whole development environment, a GL like API, another more low level console like, both with hardware acceleration (although the actual one used on the devkit wasn't exposed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And this is how GD-ROMs got ripped.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My great grandfather was the vice rector of the university at the time, as an historian he took the initiative to covertly collect evidence of all the nazi crimes, evidence which was used in the nuremberg trials.But more interestingly, there was a nationalist movement in Belgium at the the time, and a debate on which language to use at the university. The international language (french) or the local language (flemish). He was of the opinion that both had their place, which put him in opposition to the nationalists. Since he was one of the founders of the flemish literature movement, and the prime expert on flemish history he was hard to attack directly by the nationalists. So they denounced him to the gestapo, hoping they would get rid of him while keeping their hands clean. Fortunately for me it didn’t work, as the nazis were also reliant on his academic work for their pan-germanic narrative and refused to attack him directly as well.Nowadays we see as well western nationalist movements with ambivalent support for murderous regimes such as Russia, and I think this support comes in no small part from the idea that those regimes can be used to do the dirty work that they are too cowardly to do themselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now we need an article about KULouvian splitting with UCLouvain and building a new town and university from scratch in less than 3 years, a true engineering marvel.Related that library was split into 2 because of this: https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/when-was-the-leuven-li...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leuven.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the wood frog, a unique amphibian known for its remarkable adaptations to cold environments. It highlights the frog's ability to survive in freezing temperatures by entering a state of suspended animation during winter, which allows it to endure prolonged periods of subzero conditions. The text also covers the wood frog's habitat preferences, reproductive behaviors, and distinctive characteristics, emphasizing its role in the ecosystem and the importance of conservation efforts to protect this species and its environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A great book about how animals survive super cold winters is "Winter World" by Bernd Heinrich.Bernd is a super fascinating biologist who really dives deep in to things. At one point in the book I think he was talking about chipmunks surviving winter, and it goes really fun on the first principles. Something like: "chipmunks have a surface area of X m^2, and need to maintain an internal temperature of Y˚C. If the outside temperature is -40˚C they therefore they need to consume Z calories per hour just to maintain body temperature. Their favorite food are pine nuts from the white pine tree. The pine nuts each have B calories, so the chipmunk will need to eat D of them per hour. How many nuts can a chipmunk fit in its mouth? Well I found a dead one and shoved pine nuts in to its mouth until I couldn't fit anymore, and managed to get 17 in there. That means..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Nobody yet understands what starts the wood frog’s heart after being frozen and inert for the entire northern winter.To me, that's the most fascinating part of the (already quite fascinating) story. Frog is frozen solid, there is no (to our knowledge) heartbeat or brain activity. It thaws and something happens that gets it going again.I have trouble imagining what that mechanism could even look like. Tiny portion of brain responsible for keeping track of frozen-ness? Some chemical signaling from within the body cavity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious to how long the frozen structure can "survive". I wonder if it's a good idea to freeze one such frog and thaw it centuries later (an amphibian time-traveler!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42149433</guid></item><item><title>11.

Scrolling to the next section got me thinking "Don't get scammed at closing, get scammed before closing after uploading your mortgage documents to a random website."Cool idea though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once knew a founder of a pre-GPT-3 AI product that analyzed certain cost-adjacent documents to find "hidden" optimizations. The "AI" was the founder, an expert in that industry, churning through the uploaded documents himself and writing reports by hand detailing potential cost savings. How far we've come!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the launch!A bit unrelated question, but what is the fastest way to obtain a similar looks and feel for the UI?

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "scooter" by Thomas Schafer presents a lightweight, customizable library designed for facilitating the management of application state in JavaScript. It emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, enabling developers to implement state management without the overhead of more complex solutions. The project includes documentation on installation, usage, and examples to help users integrate it into their applications effectively. Additionally, it encourages contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the library's functionality and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You get all this and more with a direct perl one liner. Without the interactivity. I'd argue that if it is a lot of files, interactivity would be a pain. Also, since the original is preserved as a .bak file, one can be fearless about trying   #change xxx to yyy in all html
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/xxx/yyy/g' *.html

   #change xxx10 (say) to yyy10 in all html
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/xxx(\d+)/yyy$1/g' *.html

   # Change x4 to yyyy, where the number of y's equals to the number after x.
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/x(\d+)/"y" x $1/ge' *.

The last example shows the /e operator, which evaluates an expression and uses the result as substitute, instead of a simple string.And finally, to exclude files, one can use a subshell.  For example, suppose you want to change all html, but exclude undesirable.html..   perl -pi.bak -e 's/x/y/g'  $(ls *.html | egrep -v undesirable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool!  I currently use `sad` for this, if you're already an fzf user you should check it out.https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're losing the art of bash
```
find -type f -iname '*.go' | xargs -r -n1 sed -i 's,foo,foobar,g'
```&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42148543</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform that has been gaining traction in light of recent dissatisfaction with traditional platforms like Twitter. It highlights Bluesky's innovative features, its commitment to user privacy and decentralization, and the growing user base that is attracted to its unique approach. The author reflects on the implications of Bluesky's success for the future of social media, suggesting that it may represent a significant shift in how online interactions are structured, potentially redefining user engagement and content sharing in a more community-focused manner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My take is that Bluesky is a nicer place than Mastodon.Personally I think politics are terrible on microblogging platforms for the reason that you can't say very much in 140 characters or even 1400 characters.A common kind of profile on that kind of platform is:  "There are good people and bad people and I'm one of the good people"It is very easy to other people and share memes that build group cohesion while driving other people away.  Really making progress requires in politics a lot of "I agree with you about 90% but there is 10% that I don't" or "Well,  I negotiated something in the backroom that you'd really hate but headed off a situation you would have thought was catastrophic but you won't appreciate that I did it so you and I are both better off if I don't tell you" and other sorts of nuance, you don't want to see how the sausage is made, etc.To stand Mastodon (where you would have thought fascists were taking over the world a year ago if you believed what you read) I have to have about 20 or so block rules.I see some people with the same kind of profiles on Bluesky but see a lot less othering in my feed because the "Discover" feed on Bluesky filters out a lot of angry content.  My rough estimate is that it removes about 75% of the divisive political junk.  That(1) Immediately improves my feed,  but also(2) Reduces the amount of re-posted angry political content (it's like adding some boron to the coolant in a nuclear reactor) and(3) Since angry political memes don't work anymore people find a different game to playMy guess is the X-odus folks are less agreeable than average for the same reason why people who "left California" to go to Colorado or someplace else are less agreeable.  Those who go are less agreeable than those who stay.  On the other hand,  a certain amount of suppression of negativity could stop it from spreading and might not even be noticed as "censorship".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent and related:How to migrate from X to Bluesky without losing your followers - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147430 - Nov 2024 (42 comments)1M people have joined Bluesky in the last day - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42144340 - Nov 2024 (109 comments)Ask HN: Bluesky is #1 in the U.S. App Store.

It feels like Twitter becoming a monoculture and others are having their monoculture somewhere else because Bluesky also doesn't feel diverse to me - more like the opposite of Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150278</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for scaling the performance of Django applications, emphasizing the importance of optimizing database queries, using caching mechanisms, and employing load balancing to handle increased traffic. It highlights various techniques such as optimizing middleware usage, enhancing static file handling, and implementing asynchronous processing to improve response times. Additionally, the piece recommends monitoring and profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and ensure efficient resource management, ultimately guiding developers to create more scalable and high-performing Django applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, measure after the optimizations too, and measure in production with an apm.Second, some only work sometimes : select_related / prefetch_related / iterator will lead to giga SQL queries with nested joins all over the place, and ends by exploding ram usage. It will help at first, but soon enough one will pay any missing sql knowledge or naive relationships.Third, caching without taking the context into account will probably lead to data corruption one way or another. Debugging stale cache issues is not fun, since you cannot reproduce them easily.Fourth, celery is a whole new world, which requires workers, retry and idempotent logic, etc.Finally, scaling is also about code:  architecture, good practices, basic algorithm, etcI'll end by linking to more complete resources :

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the differences between C++ template metaprogramming and Lisp macros, highlighting their respective capabilities and uses in programming. It examines how C++ templates operate at compile-time to enable code generation and type manipulation, while Lisp macros facilitate code transformation and manipulation at a higher level. The comparison emphasizes the strengths and limitations of each approach, reflecting on performance, expressiveness, and ease of use in various programming scenarios. The author concludes by considering the evolving roles of both techniques in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Factorial macro example in C++23 metaprogramming,  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  consteval long factorial (int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;

    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }

  int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; factorial(7) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }

Exercise for the reader if using VC++ or clang/ninja, use import std instead.-- https://godbolt.org/z/TWe11hM6jNicely put 5040 in ESI register at compile time.Granted, C++ isn't Lisp, but already has quite a room for creativity at compile time, and C++26 might finally have compile time reflection as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common misconception of non Lispers that macros are equivalent to compile time programming. You’re not simply moving the evaluation to compile time, you’re moving it upwards outside the program space into a higher dimension of programmability.Not to dog on C++ unfairly, CTE is pretty neat after all.Funnily enough, PGs “On Lisp” has some really neat macros in it that demonstrate capabilities that just can’t be replicated with template based macros, iirc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    (defmacro factorial (n)
      (labels ((fact (m)
                 (if (= m 0)
                     1
                     (* m (fact (1- m))))))
        `,(fact n)))

The `, has no use here and can be removed. Here the backquote and the evaluation just returns the computed value.Thus, this is okay:    (defmacro factorial (n)
      (labels ((fact (m)
                 (if (= m 0)
                     1
                     (* m (fact (1- m))))))
        (fact n)))

LABELS defines local recursive functions. The macro returns the result of calling FACT, which is a number and which is a valid form in Common Lisp. A number evaluates to itself.    CL-USER &gt; (macroexpand-1 '(factorial 10))

&lt;p&gt;Apple has introduced a new security feature that automatically reboots iPhones after three days of being powered on without a restart, a measure aimed at enhancing device security. This feature is designed to combat vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or malware, as it helps clear temporary files and resets processes, making it harder for malicious software to remain active. Researchers have confirmed the effectiveness of this feature, emphasizing its crucial role in protecting users' data and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;emiT-C is a project available on GitHub that provides an implementation of a tool designed for the processing and analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using the EMIT (Electrocardiographic Medicine Information Tool) methodology. The repository includes code, documentation, and resources aimed at assisting developers and researchers in utilizing the tool effectively for ECG signal analysis and enhancing medical data research. Users can explore features that facilitate ECG data extraction and processing, with an emphasis on usability and performance in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am going to be harsh here, but I think it’s necessary:  I don’t think anyone should use Emit-C in production.  Without proper tooling, including a time-traveling debugger and a temporal paradox linter, the use case just fails compared to more established languages like Rust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, this reminds me of Jefferson’s time warp (virtual time), but that was more for dealing with inconsistencies brought about by concurrent processing.https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37499.37508I wrote a paper with Jonathan Edwards around the concept of managed time a while back also:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/program...But this is more like time traveling as an explicit first class thing, rather than just a way to make things consistent wrt to concurrency or live programming. I don’t think first-class time travel has been explored so much yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm waiting for the day when we have all agreed that what is done here is not time travelling. Rather, it is a simulation of time travelling, or pseudo time travelling, if you will. At the same time, I'm afraid this will never happen since it is already too late, since we have missed the point in time when there was the chance to call it right. For this, we would need real time travelling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42116038</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The PEX tool is a command-line utility designed for creating Python executable files, enabling developers to package Python applications along with their dependencies into a single file. By using PEX, users can ensure that their software runs consistently across different environments without requiring Python installations. The tool supports a wide range of features, including compatibility with various Python versions, a flexible mechanism for specifying dependencies, and options for debugging. The project is hosted on GitHub, where users can find documentation, examples, and the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used python to write a small utility that i wanted to share with a coworker, ended up having to rewrite it in Go because i spent 3 hours trying to compile the python version to an exe so that it was easier to run on their machine.I wonder why isn't there an easy way to just package the interpreter inside an EXE for people that don't care about binary size just so that it would make it seamless to package up utilities written in python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always on the lookout for ways of packaging Python programs/script-piles into single-file executables, so thank you for posting this!The GitHub README says it builds on the Python .ZIP App format (PEP441), which in turns says you can put your app in a .ZIP file and Python will run it as an app.I think I went this route with PyInstaller's one-file output option.  But I found it to be too slow because (1) my app was a CLI app and I needed it to start, run, and end quickly, (2) I imported something from Django because it was useful (which ballooned the size), and (3) the single-file .ZIP needed to be extracted into a temporary directory, run, and then deleted every time (!!!).Does anyone know how Pex / PEP441 deals with this?  Is the extract-run-delete thing normal/standard?  Is there a way to cache the extracted app?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the easiest way to do this now is with uv and their support for inline metadata. At this point you can just have the user install uv with a single command and then have the user run the script with `uv run example.py`.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42148220</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the practice of rubbing snow on frozen feet, explaining that it can stimulate circulation and provide temporary relief from cold. It highlights the contrast between the cold sensation of snow and the warmth of body heat that can help in restoring feeling to frostbitten or numb extremities. However, it also warns against using snow if the skin is severely frostbitten, as this may exacerbate the condition. Overall, the discussion provides insights into the potential effects and risks associated with this method of warming up cold feet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it got started with people misunderstanding / misremembering drying off by rubbing snow on wet skin. Being wet in cold conditions can be a death sentence so you need to dry off quickly, and this is one of the recommended methods.https://www.ncexped.com/drying-off-snow/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a kid we’d be spending a whole day playing in snow. When we’d come home in the evening with ice on the shoes, hair and cold hands and feet -  but not as bad as getting real frost bites - would have a little warm up. My grandmother taught me to wash my hands with cold water at first then gradually add warm water. I still remeber cold water felt warm on frozen hands. Also many times when my hands were cold I’d make some snowballs, feel cold for a few seconds then my hands would start warming up really fast, like glowing with heat. I think there’s something to it, though being a bit cold and having frostbites is a big difference. I personally never experience any frostbite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to keep in mind, is that if somebody is hypothermic and not just frostbitten, then rapid re-warming is a bad idea.Body protects itself by shutting down blood flow to skin and extremities, keeping the core warm. So if the extremities are rapidly re-warmed, then blood vessels in them dilate. And then blood starts flowing through oxygen-depleted tissues that are cold and full of accumulated metabolic waste.Not a good combination, and you might end up with organ damage as a result.Gradual re-warming instead gives the body time to slowly clear the waste as blood flow re-establishes itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42151569</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive tutorial on using Matrix, an open-source protocol for real-time communication, aimed at helping users understand its features and functionalities. It covers fundamental concepts, guides on how to set up and use Matrix clients, details on server configuration, and troubleshooting tips. The tutorial is designed for both beginners and those with some technical background, ensuring a clear and practical understanding of Matrix's capabilities for secure and decentralized communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a comment here complaining that Matrix is a failure as an open protocol because encryption in Matrix is too complex and hard and PFS is overrated and "why can't we have a simple protocol for chat like Wireguard is for VPNs"... but it got deleted while i as writing my reply.  I'll post the reply anyway:Matrix without encryption is as simple as it gets - e.g. here was a younger, happier me writing a working client in 8 lines of bash: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20948530With encryption, inevitably things get way more complicated - especially in a decentralised network which needs to be byzantine fault tolerant. As you say, we've successfully simplified this by providing best-in-class implementations like matrix-rust-sdk-crypto - which i'd argue is the equivalent to Wireguard (which under the hood is a bunch of gnarly crypto, even if the API it exposes it simple).In the end, encrypting messaging is just way harder than a VPN.  The encryption hooks need to know the membership of the room (as users), the membership of the room (as devices), verify identities of all devices and their users to prevent MITM, verify that only the right devices can be added to the room, handle accessing history for new logins and new joiners, handle backing up history if you log out of all devices, handle receiving msgs if you log out of all devices, handle encrypted push notifs and allow multiple processes (push, share extension, etc) to share the same crypto state, scale to thousands of devices, etc etc.Meanwhile if you simplify that by removing PFS - sure, some of it gets better ("the room history gets encrypted by a static password!") but then breaching that secret from any client at any point trivially leaks the whole history of the room.In terms of "Matrix as an open protocol isn't very successful", i suggest taking a look at https://2024.matrix.org/watch/ for the zeitgeist from a few weeks ago. It's working for some folks at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of good clients is really holding Matrix back. Element is rather bloated, and most of the other clients are missing significant amounts of features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been setting up servers for everything ranging from IRC to Teamspeak, Exchange, and you name it. But how come setting up a Matrix server is still a science in itself?Yes, I'm aware of the Ansible script, but should that really be the only somewhat reasonable option? When Matrix wrote " Matrix 2.0 a new chance if you gave up on us in the past".I listened, but without a somewhat reasonable setup process for the server and the ongoing confusion in terms of clients, it hasn't gotten any easier to onboard to Matrix, unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42142790</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game developers have been doing this since forever, its one of their main reasons to avoid the STL.EASTL has this as a feature by default, and unreal engine container library has the boundchecks enabled on most games. The performance cost of those boundchecks in practice is well worth the reduction of bugs even on performance sensitive code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We’ve begun by enabling hardened libc++, which adds bounds checking to standard C++ data structures, eliminating a significant class of spatial safety bugs.Well, it's 2024 and remember arguing this 20+ years ago. Programs have bugs that bounds checking catches. And making it a language built-in exposes it to compiler optimizations specifically targeting bounds checks, eliminating many and bringing the dynamic cost down immensely. Just turning them on in libraries doesn't necessarily expose all the compiler optimizations, but it's a start. Safety checks should really be built into the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The safety checks have uncovered over 1,000 bugsIn most implementations of the standard library, safety checks can be enabled with a simple #define. In some, it's the default behavior in DEBUG mode. I wonder what this library improves on that and why these bugs have not been discovered before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150550</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the status of Python's PEP 704, which aims to introduce a standardized way of handling type hints for the language's core capabilities. It details the community's opinions on the proposal, its potential impact on type hinting, and the ongoing debate around its implementation. The author emphasizes the significance of adopting this PEP for improving the consistency and reliability of type hints in Python, while also providing insights into the current development process and potential timelines for its acceptance and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suggest reading this detailed article to understand why they built this: https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/11/14/attestations-a-new-g...The implementation is interesting - it's a static page built using GitHub Actions, and the key part of the implementation is this Python function here: https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/blob/a87a88...If you read the code you can see that it's hitting pages like https://pypi.org/simple/pydantic/ - which return HTML - but sending this header instead:    Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json

Then scanning through the resulting JSON looking for files that have a provenance that isn't set to null.Here's an equivalent curl + jq incantation:    curl -s \
      -H 'Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json' \
      https://pypi.org/simple/pydantic/ \
    | jq '.files | map(select(.provenance != null)) | length'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://slsa.dev/ gives much clearer explanations about the why of this work.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shameless plug for a similar but totally different system that I've used to pretty good effect lately: https://github.com/gaffo/jorb meant for just trying to run batches of items with many steps in a simple way.A major benefit of my tool is that it ends up being pretty easy to re-wire the flows of tasks through the state tree. I tried for a ipynb type workflow as much as possible where I'm storing state on every state change, this lets me kill and restart the processing easily and often only losing the work that was in process on the in flight state changes. I find myself wiring up the first few steps of the state diagram and making the ones I haven't figured out yet temporariliy terminal. Then my computer is crunching away on pre-work and I let one item through at a time in the debugger, figure out that state, and move to the next state, and restart the flow. New items now start processing through the newly non-terminal state. I set breakpoints at all of the exceptional states and let it run working on the next step in the flow. I handle the exceptions and then open the flood gates with parallelism on the state, while also coding up the new state transitions. This lets my computer do a lot of work against things that have concurrency limits or rate limits while working, lowering the totally wall clock time of the large batch job.What do I use it for for reals? I've been using it to check out and modify large swaths of code bases and build them against a build fleet where I'm rate limited on the build submissions and the ability to pull the code down and modify it. Or where I need to do walking of a large number of expensive apis over time to do complex calculations on small (1-5k sets of data).I've always thought of building a dag renderer for the graph but I'm changing the graph during execution a lot, what I actually want is to render the state changes of a given task&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most credit to taskflow: https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have this https://github.com/Azure/go-asyncjob library as well, with generic strongType connecting each step input/output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147934</guid></item><item><title>29.

Anyone know of any clever workarounds for this? Seems like maybe I could MITM the myQ service since my car and garage would both be on the same WiFi when I'm home, but I don't know if there are OSS replacements for the myQ server software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great to see more and more open source hardware products that work seamlessly with home assistant.Home assistant is getting more and more user friendly and these open IoT devices also improve significantly.I am quite positive that there will be an "alternative" ecosystem to proprietary subscription locking in ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I helped my friend instal one of these closed source ones and I never saw the point. They shut down their integration with his Alexa and other automations later which was amusing, but it kind of just showed off the fact that, yeah, you pretty much push the button in your car or the button inside your garage or on the keypad outside your garage and that’s pretty much all you ever do with a garage door so this smart home stuff doesn’t really add much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150376</guid></item><item><title>30.

Having previously been caught mechanically rigging the button-pushing work of his nightly rounds, the watchman was given a pedometer to ensure that he was manually completing his work. Although this use of quantum media — media that count, quantify, or enumerate — to more closely monitor the watchman’s activities seemed to work for several nights, he was eventually found sleeping in the engine room, having attached the pedometer to a piston rod"Having worked briefly in security - I found it hilarious. 
Nowdays it works by scanning RFID chips on the guarded areas with a smartphone, so cheating here is way harder (I considered it of course), it would have included hacking the work smartphone and the surveillance software.Either way - the other nightguards there complained a lot because of their recent high raise in workload - which now meant patrolling by car and foot for 2 hours, instead of 1 - then you checked in all the points - and could sleep or play consoles for the next 10 hours (or in my case programming on my projects), as long as you could wake up if an actual alarm happened. So not that much stress ..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions that carriages had odometers, which I found just as surprising as pedometers existing in that era.

No one's doing ASM programming on x86 CPUs these days (and certainly not Pentium4 CPUs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fascinating peek into the fairly deep past (sigh) is Abrash's The Zen of Assembly language.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the financial implications and challenges associated with phasing out coal as an energy source. It examines various strategies for transition, including investment in renewable energy and the potential economic impact on communities reliant on coal mining. The discussion includes estimates of costs required to replace coal infrastructure, the benefits of reducing carbon emissions, and the overall feasibility of a coal-free future, highlighting both environmental and economic factors in this critical energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishermen off the coast of the Isle of Skye in Scotland unexpectedly discovered a submerged U.S. nuclear submarine while searching for halibut. The incident highlights the increasing visibility of such military vessels and raises concerns about their safety and potential environmental impacts. The fishermen described their encounter and reported the submarine's unusual appearance and the eerie silence surrounding it, prompting discussions about naval activities in the region and the implications of underwater military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

This one dates from 2003:On April 25, 2003 the crew of a Chinese fishing boat noticed a strange sight—a periscope drifting listlessly above the surface of the water. The fishermen notified the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) which promptly dispatched two vessels to investigate.https://www.chieftain.com/story/news/2018/06/07/in-2003-chin...Every one of the submariners died.There was another reported Chinese sub accident in 2023, but it's not clear how it was discovered (https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/china-submarine-death...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard a story of a fishing boat in the eastern US that was "fighting a fish" for miles but could never get any traction. When another fisherman looked at their chart, he noted that they were dragged miles in a straight line towards Europe, and said "You caught a sub". The submariners don't care, they probably find it funny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of event be pretty nasty - 4 fishermen were killed by a Royal Navy submarine in 1990:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FV_Antares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147675</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the trend of overly complex coding challenges used in technical interviews, asserting that they do not accurately reflect a candidate's real-world programming skills. It criticizes these challenges for being unreasonable, abstract, and disconnected from practical applications, ultimately calling for a change in how technical proficiency is assessed. The author advocates for interview processes that focus on collaboration, problem-solving, and practical knowledge rather than obscure algorithms and time constraints, promoting a more effective and reflective evaluation of a developer's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small anecdote.A partner of a friend quit their job earlier this year.  They then took 4-6 weeks to prepare for each interview with Big Tech companies (4-6 weeks for Meta, 4-6 weeks for Stripe, etc.).  Along the way, they also took random interviews just to practice and build muscle memory.  They would grind leetcode several hours a day after researching which questions were likely to be encountered at each Big Tech.This paid off and they accepted an offer for L6/staff at a MAANG.Talked to them this week (haven't even started the new role) and they've already forgotten the details of most of what was practiced.  They said that the hardest part was studying for the system design portion because they did not have experience with system design...but now made staff eng. at a MAANG.  IRL, this individual is a good but not exceptional engineer having worked with them on a small project.Wild; absolutely wild and I feel like explains a lot of the boom and bust hiring cycles.  When I watch some of the system design interview prep videos, it's just a script.  You'll go into the call and all you need to do is largely follow the script.  It doesn't matter if you've actually designed similar or more complex systems; the point of the system design interview is apparently "do you know the script"?Watch these two back to back at 2x speed and marvel at how much of this is executed like a script:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qu1F9BXow- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-eupuDVEc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently ran an interview process for a relatively senior eng role at a tiny startup.  Because I believe different interview methods work better for different people, I offered everyone a choice:1. Do a takehome test, targeted to take about 4 hours but with no actual time limit.  This was a non-algorithmic project that was just a stripped-down version of what I'd spent the last month on in actual work.2. Do an onsite pairing exercise in 2 hours.  This would be a version of #1, but more of "see how far we get in 2 hours."3. Submit a code sample of pre-existing work.Based on the ire I've seen takehome tests get, I figured we'd get a good spread between all three, but amazingly, ~90-95% of candidates chose the takehome test.  That matches my preference as a candidate as well.I don't know if this generalizes beyond this company/role, but it was an interesting datapoint - I was very surprised to find that most people preferred it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147790</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see some sort of multiple regression or ANOVA on this, instead of singling out a single variable. Is car brand really the best independent predictor? Or is it specific design decisions you tend to see in certain brands?(Like, say, maximizing driver distraction by consolidating a bunch of essential controls and information displays into a touchscreen display that's really difficult to operate when it's sunny outside. Just to pick something at random, of course.)Somewhat related, I was recently shopping for refrigerators, and fell down a data rabbit hole. If you just look at the overall style of fridge, French doors look like a terrible option from a reliability perspective. But then, digging in a bit more, it turns out that's kind of a spurious correlation. Actually it's the presence of bells and whistles like through-door ice dispensers that kill a refrigerator's reliability. And then perhaps on top of that the amount of extra Rube Goldberg machine you need to make a chest height ice dispenser work in a bottom-freezer French door refrigerator creates even more moving parts to break. But a those problems don't apply to a model that doesn't have that feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thoroughyl expect the Deparment of Government Efficiency to recommend U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) be shut down to save previous taxpayer dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a big picture, this makes sense. You can load the cars with safety features, but it doesn't change the fact that these cars are very heavy, very fast, and loaded with features that reward distracted driving. In the US at least, the top killer of drivers are trees on the side of the road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150443</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author says nitrous use doesn’t occupy any cultural space but for me I associate it with Aleister Crowley and the many “magick” things that he influenced- it was used before a lot of rituals they did. William James was a big early influence for him. But also he did a lot of other drugs too.Looking the mechanism of action - that it replaces oxygen in the brain - it’s pretty obvious why long term use can be so damaging to your brain. It might also contribute to how crazy Crowley gets in his later years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zappos founder Tony Hsieh was addicted to nitrous. It sounded real bad! He ended up dying in a house fire while locked in a basement, in a situation that had "bizarre suicide" written all over it.I've certainly enjoyed a huff or two in my day, but learning someone could become dependent was news to me.  And then last year a close friend had to go into residential rehab for nitrous issues.  Who knew?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's another psychoactive gas : Xenon. Apparently it's a truly amazing high. I can only speculate tho because it's also truly expensive.

    get-param name
    @This is Hello World from &lt;&lt;p-out name&gt;&gt;
  end-handler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only owner of this project is "Gliim LLC" and it's written in C with cryptic commit messages. This looks dangerous. If this is an honest project and not an attempt to inject malware into other people's projects, you should:  - Say who you are.
  - Commit as individuals, not as the company.
  - Explain how this is memory safe. The C language makes that seem very unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the offered cryptographic primitives (encrypt-data[1], decrypt-data[2], derive-key[3]) are not easy to use correctly.The encrypt/decrypt data interface uses AES-256-CBC with (seemingly) no authentication, and the key derivation uses PBKDF2 with default iterations of 1000 and vague instructions on which value to choose. No interface to a memory-hard KDF is available.This, along with the notion of memory safety from untested C code doesn't really instill a sense of confidence in me...I would suggest throwing away all the cryptographic primitives you currently have and instead interface with libsodium, which is a library designed for the rest of us non-cryptographers.[1]: https://gliimly.github.io/encrypt-data.html

The author reflects on her desire for her daughter to experience the richness of both worlds, highlighting the benefits of sign language and the deaf community while also recognizing the opportunities that come with accessing spoken language and hearing environments. She discusses the challenges and societal perceptions related to deafness, and advocates for her daughter’s ability to navigate both identities, allowing her to thrive and choose her own path.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the narrative around disabled people has advanced to the point where some now insist that they aren't disabled. In reality, it's a pretty objective fact that being disabled means being unable to do something. It is a net negative on someone's quality of life. I'd be jolly pissed off if my parent decided not to get me an implant that enabled me to hear just because someone had told them that being deaf was actually the same as being able to hear. Give the kid the hearing aid, and if they don't like it they can take it out later.There are plenty of things where this "different, not worse" narrative holds up. Children with autism or ADHD might struggle in some ways, but be better off in others. It seems clear that there is no objective reason they are worse than a neurotypical person, so if a "cure" to these conditions was developed, you would have some degree of moral quandary. But someone without hearing is just objectively worse off than someone with it, the same way someone without legs is worse off than someone with legs.The last part is what really gets me about this. The child values the hearing aid so highly that they literally hug it as they go to sleep, and this is somehow presented as a "both sides are right" outcome. To me at least, that's a pretty conclusive endorsement that kids should be given these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My wife and I faced a similar situation and found it a simple decision. We both carry GJB-2 gene mutations that will likely result in profound non-syndromic hearing loss. We went through Orchid Health to get a whole genome sequence of our prospective embryos and then selected one that was not affected by the condition.We have 1 more carrier girl and 2 more unaffected girls to work with, and if we want boys later in life we will probably wait for Decibel Therapeutics / Regeneron to finish their GJB-2 gene therapy before we have that child. If there are constraints then we will have a cochlear implant or simply not implant that embryo.It was obvious to us how it should play out. My wife and I have an obligation to maximize the cone of possibility for our children and a duty to equip them best to experience the world so that they can choose the path through it that they wish.Just like I would not pierce the eardrums of my child after she is born, I shall not intentionally choose an embryo that carries a debilitating condition that I cannot remedy or mitigate if I can choose otherwise. I don’t think this is a dilemma in any way. There is an obvious choice for us. We will not deny her normative sense organs. My parents got me glasses and contact lenses. My life would have been much less vibrant if they had chosen to not provide me those prosthetics.Some parents are not so fortunate as us to have this choice. I hope modern therapeutics will enable all children and adults to have the full range of sensors that most humans carry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm "almost" a lifelong user of a cochlear implant. I got my first one when I was 9. Before I got it, I was communicating through lip reading and speaking, I never knew sign language. Lip reading I still use relatively often -- when I'm at a crowded restaurant, or at an unbearably noisy party, and there's many interlocutors at the table, I persistently stare at their lips. They take me for a great listener, when in fact, I can't hear shit, and I'm desperately switching back and forth between people's mouths to catch what they're saying. I'm out of shape and this takes so much of my brain power to understand people that I often cannot contribute my thoughts.Though my cochlear isn't perfect, I would never think of not getting it. In fact, I'd probably be rather angry at my parents for not helping me get one as soon as it was possible. During my childhood and up until late college, I've only ever met one person who was so severely hard of hearing and was about my age, and that was where I have been getting my speech lessons before I got my first cochlear implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145935</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a map go viral in 2013, a map of US rivers. Here's the Daily Mail article about it, the apotheosis of virulence. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342083/The-veins-n...Two things made it go viral.1. Jason Kottke posted it to his weblog. Either you know about Kottke or you don't. Many journalists do. He's an authentic low-key tastemaker.2. I shared the map on Flickr with a CC by-SA license. Which meant any publication could republish it for free without even asking me.I'm still a little embarrassed about it. The map is pretty simple. The visualization is highly misleading and has all sorts of ugly visual artifacts. That Daily Mail article is full of mistakes (including misspelling my name three different ways.) The picture wasn't even really my goal, it was just a debugging workprint off my "real" project, a GitHub repo teaching people how to make maps in Javascript with vector tiles. But the picture looked cool and was easy to understand.But I'm also proud of the result. It did look cool! And the recognition pleased my vanity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First mistake was trying to market to _students_Not sure how long this person has been out of school, but students are notoriously cheap. I’m not surprised there was no interest when monetizing/charging.Maybe a collab between law schools and including the tool there. Students get it “free” and you get paid by the law school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspiring story. TL;DR: Built a legal tech for students, tried selling for a while, didnt get a lot of traction and then ultimately sold the project to someone else.I think you did a lot of things the right way but probably went after a tough market. Students. Students are the most broke category and then comes indiehackers :). I would usually refrain from selling to these 2."A quick market-sizing exercise: there are ~110k law students in the US, ~25% of whom are in journals, and half of those are 2nd years. If I could penetrate even 10% of that market at $10/month, I’d be at $165k in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)"Haha. This is a classic newbie founder mistake thinking all you need is a % of the market. We all have made it. Now you know. Market estimate should be made bottom up, not top down."find the connectors"This is so key. If you are in a niche industry, finding the right connections who can open doors can be huge."Don't be a solo founder"As a solo founder (even though with a small team), I couldn't agree more. I know having  co-founders brings in risks of conflict etc but I am so ready to build a fresh team with cofounders who are thinking about the business 24-7 like I do. If you have a team like that and you work well together, that's a dream.Tell us more about your next thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't Zotero already do this?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Windows Memory-Mapped File I/O, explaining how it allows processes to share data efficiently and access files through memory addresses. It covers the benefits of using memory mapping for file operations, including improved performance and simplicity in accessing large files. The author provides code examples illustrating the use of relevant Windows API functions, such as `CreateFileMapping` and `MapViewOfFile`, and concludes with practical tips for implementing memory-mapped files in applications. Overall, it serves as a guide for developers looking to utilize this feature in Windows programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A memory mapped file can be used to store complex object oriented structures if you make use of 'relative' pointers, where you have to add the address of the pointer to the pointer to get to the object you are pointing to. I once used this method, to persist a complex data structure without having to write serialization code.A long time ago, I implemented some C++ classes that would hide most of the additional work and also took care of allocating new objects inside the memory mapped file. See: https://www.iwriteiam.nl/D0205.html#13MMF (Note that this implementation actually makes use of a slightly different approach where pointers are relative with respect to the first position of the file. This implementation has the limitation that you can only open one such store as a memory mapped file. It was only later I realized that it was possible to do without the offset. I never came to rewriting all the code.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you should be able to get rid of most of the undocumented API usage with the newer CreateFileMapping2/MapViewOfFile3 APIs. Though that does require a higher minimum OS version and the crucial NtExtendSection function still has no documented equivalent as far as I can tell, so it's kind of a wash.Also, you can link against ntdll.lib directly. Manually calling GetProcAddress for a few functions isn't a tragedy by any means, but in this case, why bother?Great article nonetheless!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 2022 libtorrent implemented memory mapped IO as part of v2 [1]. Unfortunately, it didn't go so well.  Memory usage went through the sky, leading to performance degradation and crashing [2]. The issue is still open in the project to this day, and many programs have stuck with the v1.2 library instead.It looks like they are headed to a multi-threaded pread implementation now [3] and someone has created a patch to tweak the current mmap fallback that uses pread to perform better in the meantime [4].[1] - https://www.libtorrent.org/upgrade_to_2.0-ref.html[2] - https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/6667[3] - https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/pull/7013[4] - https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pull/21300&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075278</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Eric Adams' office is directing New York City agencies to create accounts on the emerging social media platform Bluesky, encouraging officials to engage with the public as the platform gains popularity. This initiative aims to enhance communication and transparency between the government and citizens, as more people migrate from traditional platforms like Twitter to Bluesky. The move reflects the city's effort to stay current with digital trends and foster interaction in a changing social media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So soon, all the democrats will be on BlueSky and all the republicans will be on X/Twitter?Meanwhile us foreigners will have to maintain an account on both platforms to understand what our global overlords have decided for us today ;pAs an aside, my country has banned Twitter... yet everyone in the government, from the prime minister to the junior bureaucrat, uses twitter to issue announcements. They all use VPN. The whole thing is hilarious and sad. And I have to use VPN to find out if the road I'll go out yet is blocked or if we will have electricity today.Basically, the international market is unlikely to move to BlueSky, then again I could be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't care who owns it, social media is a cancer. Decentralized social media is actually worse because it fragments information, which makes it harder to access, harder to collaborate on, hides subtle knowledge, and creates further in-groups and echo chambers.What gets highlighted is almost never what is more intellectual, moral, factual, important, or curated. Instead it's whatever is entertaining, angering, scary, validating. It's a machine for capturing people's baser instincts and biases and weaponizing them to make people stupid and reactive.And it's designed to be addictive. This isn't even just the "big" social media sites. Anything with a "feed" or "endless scroll" is designed to hook you, keep you there, keep you engaging. Cigarettes may not be your drug of choice, but TikTok may be.Go ahead and quit social media. You know what people almost universally report? They feel calmer. Happier. Healthier. Less scared. They have more free time. It's a weight off their shoulders. Now imagine the opposite of all that, affecting nearly everyone connected to the internet. Imagine what that does over decades.This machine is eroding society. In the future, we're going to find out that social media was worse than cigarettes. The addictive habit that slowly destroys lives - even nations - over decades.I'm not the only person who has had friends have nervous breakdowns from social media. This is a pubic health emergency, but we're treating it like its politics. Politics is just a symptom of the greater disease: an epidemic of manipulation machines designed to ruin our health for clicks. The machine doesn't even know it's doing this to us. It's just doing what it was programmed to do. And we lap it up, like so many flies wandering into the fly trap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twitter at it's peak had less monthly active users than Facebook Stories.Outside of the journalist and media class, nobody used twitter. 300M+ people are a huge number, but barely scratches the surface in the Social Media world. What can bluesky do different to attract normies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143755</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get that this seems like an overreach, but America is incredibly safe for people with allergies and it's because of enforcement like this. In my 36 years of being alive, I've never once had an allergic reaction in the US due to mislabeling (although I've had them in South America and Asia).Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, there's 8 groups that MUST be labeled: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans.Everyone with an allergy knows to check that section of the packaging (it comes after the long list of ingredients), and you can trust it to be accurate. It can't just be right most of the time... it has to always be right.If that trust is broken, America will be a much less safe place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of the HN comments in this thread said,"America can simultaneously be the safest place on earth for those with food allergies, while avoiding this kind of bureaucratic nonsense.""I get that this seems like an overreach, but America is incredibly safe for people with allergies and it's because of enforcement like this."In my 40+ years of life in India, and among the many people that I've seen or interacted with in 5 Indian states (among 28 States), I've rarely heard someone say they have allergies the way they have in the US. In US, people have allergies to almost everything.In my 40+ years of life in India, and based on the various supermarkets that I've visited across 4 heavily crowded metro cities, I've rarely seen "Allergy" medicines/prescriptions occupy the shelf like they do in the US.Also in the same period of my existence in this third world country, I've rarely seen people concerned about the ingredients in a restaurant menu or labels printed on food packets or containers that there are allergy causing ingredients in there.Like George Bush once cruelly remarked, "India is the cause of shortage of food in the world", because we eat everything, and rarely check the labels or need them, or less allergic to any food. We are just short of food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real problem here is that the FDA is recommending throwing out the butter purely based on the labels.If they said, "throw out the butter if you (or whomever would have consumed it) have an allergy to milk as this is dairy milk-based butter", or if Costco said, "return it because it was not clear this was a dairy based butter" it would make more sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150991</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The SQL Style Guide is a comprehensive resource designed to promote best practices for writing SQL code. It offers guidelines on various aspects of SQL syntax, including formatting, naming conventions, and query organization, emphasizing readability and maintainability. The guide covers topics such as capitalization of keywords, use of punctuation, structuring joins and subqueries, and provides practical examples to illustrate these principles. Overall, it aims to help developers write clean, consistent, and efficient SQL code that is easy to understand and modify.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Spaces should be used to line up the code so that the root keywords all end on the same character boundary.  SELECT file_hash
    FROM file_system
   WHERE file_name = '.vimrc';

This style is annoying and I wish it gained less traction. It looks neat but it puts so much burden on the query writer, especially when you modify the query and all of the sudden you need to indent multiple lines just to make them all align. You know what's neat and still easy to modify/diff? Just indent a new line for each row.    SELECT
        file_hash
    FROM
        file_system
    WHERE
        file_name = '.vimrc';&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think my #1 rule for SQL these days is to abuse common table expressions as much as possible. No amount of whitespace cleanliness can compensate for a poorly organized problem. There is (in my mind) no longer an excuse for trying to join 10+ tables all at once in a single heroic attempt. Decompose the problem and let the query planner figure that shit out for you, just as you would with a compiler and code.With CTEs you can offload sophisticated joins and constraints in such a way that less experienced developers can follow behind more easily.Once you find multiple queries using the same WITH clauses, you can create more permanent views that further centralize and optimize these concerns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Try to only use standard SQL functions instead of vendor-specific functions for reasons of portability.Hard disagree here. "Let's do/not do this, in case we decide to change databases in the future" is one of the greatest lies we tell ourselves. You're just making your life harder now and in the near future, for the nebulous promise of "seamlessly replacing your database backend if needed".In 95% of cases, it's not needed, and you're getting all of the downsides for no benefit. And if it's needed in a late stage of your application's life, changing a bunch of SQL functions will be just one tiny problem among many bigger ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143528</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can rip a rootfs from a docker image using skopeo[1] and undocker[2] then you can puppeteer it with bwrap[3].This works for most linux distributions (they behave well as fakeroot puppets).
Package managers from Debian-based distros tend to misbehave in bwrap in my experience.I use this method to obtain software from various distro repositories or when RPM packages are distributed by vendors.[1] &lt;https://github.com/containers/skopeo&gt;[2] &lt;https://git.jakstys.lt/motiejus/undocker&gt;[3] &lt;https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Creating a chroot in Linux is pretty easy: put a rootfs in a folder and run the sudo chroot /my/folder command. But what if you don't want to use superuser privileges for this?My very first thought is actually proot ( https://proot-me.github.io/ ), though that does have a performance hit.That said, once you're using unshare (which is a good idea), why not just use podman? Mostly the same under the hood, but does a bunch of this for you. And for this exact usecase I appreciate that there are tradeoffs but I personally would have built pmbootstrap out of Dockerfiles in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What about user-mode Linux containers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107146</guid></item><item><title>1.

It walks every hop and identifies any misconfiguration.Sadly, sysadmin and netadmin tools, responsibilities, and skills are withering trades that have been subsumed or ignored in the modern SWE/SRE enterprise almost as afterthoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author of this repo here, AMA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like it currently only supports protocols http, mysql, redis?Also, when you let it run through some wireguard vpn, the information is a lot more limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42154583</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issues with Netflix's livestreaming performance during a boxing event featuring Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. Fans experienced buffering and connectivity problems, leading to frustration and complaints on social media. The piece highlights the impact of these technical difficulties on viewer experience and examines the implications for Netflix as it expands into live sports broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time a big company screws up, there are two highly informed sets of people who are guaranteed to be lurking, but rarely post, in a thread like this:1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way to deal with this is to constantly do live events, and actually build organizational muscle. Not these massive one off events in an area the tech team has no experience in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone here talking like this something unique netflix had to deal with. Hotstar live streamed india va Pakistan cricket match with zero issues  with all time high live viewership ever in the history of live telecast. Why would viewers paying $20 month want to think about their technical issues, they dropped the ball pure and simple. Tech already exists for this, it’s been done before even by espn, nothing new here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42153953</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a security perspective, and as a programmer, I've never liked ZIP files precisely because there are two mechanisms to identify the contents, the per-file header and the central directory. When you're defining a format, protocol, or w'ever, ideally there should be a single source of truth, a single valid &amp; useable parse, etc; basically, the structure of the data or process should be intrinsically constraining. There shouldn't be a pathway for multiple implementations to produce different functional results, and ZIP archives are in my mind the archetype for getting this wrong. tar files aren't ideal, but in the abstract (ignoring issues with long file names) they don't have this problem. (tar files don't support random access, either, but better to rely on something suboptimal than something that's fundamentally broken.)A similar security problem, though not as fundamentally baked into the format, is MIME parsing. The header section is supposed to be delimited from the body by an empty line (likewise for nested entities). But what if it's not? For better or worse, Sendmail was tolerant of the absence of an empty line and treated as headers everything up to the first line that didn't parse as a header or header continuation.[1] Later systems, like Postfix, originally copied this behavior. But Microsoft Exchange and Outlook are even more tolerant, yet in a much more horrendous way, by parsing as a header anything that looks like a Content-Type or related header immediately after the first empty line. They have similar hacks for other, similar violations. So today, depending on the receiving software, you can send messages that appear differently, including having different attachments. It's a security nightmare!I not a Postel's Law hater, but ZIP archives and Microsoft's MIME parsing behaviors are just egregiously wrong and indefensible. And even if you think the Robustness Principle is inherently bad policy, you still have to design your formats, protocols, and systems to be as intrinsically constraining as possible. You can't rely on vendors adhering to a MUST rule in an RFC, unless it's unquestioningly crystal clear what the repercussions will be--everybody else will (because it's the natural and convenient thing to do) reject your output as trash and drop it on the floor immediately so violations never have a chance to get a foothold.[1] MTAs don't necessarily need to care about MIME parsing, but Sendmail eventually gained features where parsing message contents mattered, setting the de facto norm (for those paying attention) until Microsoft came along.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This attack vector has been known for at least 17 years, if not longer.https://gnucitizen.org/blog/java-jar-attacks-and-features/

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first thing I tried to find on their website and their GitHub was a protocol specification, to be able to implement it independently from the reference implementation. I thought this would be straightforward since it’s advertised as a scheme/protocol, but such a spec isn’t referenced anywhere! Digging on my own I eventually found [1] on a side-branch of one of their other GitHub projects.Kudos to the author: I think it actually covers a lot of what you’d need to know: crypto identities, message formats, wire protocols, peering and stream semantics, spanning tree updates and root selection, the DHT, forwarding logic, sessions, etc. A couple things are TODOs like how to verify and sign root updates, and there’s some ambiguity in the tiebreaker algorithm for next-hop selection.It seems to be very tightly coupled to TCP as the transport layer though, since all packets need to be delivered reliably and in the order they were sent, and need to be capable of being fragmented into smaller packets for varying MTU sizes.[1] https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-specs/blob/ys...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok, so as I understand it, yggdrasil and cjdns are virtual P2P networks that offer the normal layer 3 routing services, but built on top of the existing internet. So they still require ISPs and internet backbones, etc.Are there any projects attempting to build a worldwide P2P network that can replace the IP layer? Like a mesh network that can operate without verizon, cisco routers, etc? I know of some mesh network technologies aimed at small disconnected networks but nothing consumer-facing and supporting anything more than a few thousand nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Yggdrasil Network - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41669625 - Sept 2024 (3 comments)Yggdrasil P2P mesh E2EE IPv6 network - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30156551 - Jan 2022 (77 comments)Yggdrasil – Early-stage implementation of an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27577201 - June 2021 (102 comments)Show HN: Yggdrasil Network – compact mesh routing experiment for mesh networks - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18863554 - Jan 2019 (15 comments)Announcing Yggdrasil Network v0.3 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18751991 - Dec 2018 (3 comments)Yggdrasil: End-To-end Encrypted IPv6 Networking - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18666245 - Dec 2018 (1 comment)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42155780</guid></item><item><title>5.

Good for you; this looks like a blast, and I can only imagine how fun that’d be, compared to years of purely solo gaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the former proprietor of LanParty.com (which I mistakenly included in a sale to IGN) I must salute you.  The absolute genius of the provided lan equipment and particularly the management thereof is an inspiration.I think the lack of any standing offerings of variations of Quake is a glaring mistake but easily rectified. :)It's really heartening to see lan gaming continued and offered in such a way that the amount of hassle and setup is minimized and the gaming is maximized.  We spent far too much time in the 90's and 2000's dealing with driver issues, etc etc.   Bravo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the catwalk that's actually for cats, the little cat doors and cat restrooms.

The performance increase on the difficult task as audience size increases is counterintuitive at first, but it makes sense when you consider how many humans excel at performing in front of large audiences.Yet for some of us the stress of being observed and scrutinized is crippling regardless of the task difficulty. I've bombed so many interviews because of this. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My performance on computer tasks changes when people watch me. I suddenly forget how to type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems like just the general idea of ‘an audience’ is too broad.Take a football match. The presence of your own fans has a big positive effect (usually). Presence of the other teams fans has a negative effect (usually).I would expect that the belief of the person doing the task about the audience and whether they make them feel supported or nervous or angry or whatever other complex emotion would all change the effect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095134</guid></item><item><title>7.

Lots of these kits online, but be warned it involves high voltages, so not a good beginner project. IN-12 tubes are small and easy to find, larger tubes are more expensive.2) Pay someone else to make a hand-made one - very expensive3) Buy a Chinese one. Some of these use real nixie tubes (add 'IN-12' to your search) and cost $50-ish. There are many products titled nixie tube that actually use LCD screens and look terrible.I settled on the PV electronics QTC kit and some tubes from eBay that were pre-soldered to QTC mounts. They can literally just be plugged into the kit and replaced easily if they fail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is still a small company building new tubes: https://www.daliborfarny.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author has a great youtube channel - DiodeGoneWild.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the findings of the James Webb Space Telescope, which have provided significant evidence supporting an alternate theory of gravity, challenging the traditional understanding of gravitational interactions. It highlights how these observations may offer new insights into cosmic phenomena, including galaxy formations and the behavior of dark matter. The research suggests that this alternate theory could better explain certain astrophysical events and encourages further investigation into the implications of these findings for our understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, this article is misleading at best. "...scans of ancient galaxies gathered by the JWST seem to contradict the commonly accepted predictions of the most widely accepted Cold Dark Matter theory, Lambda-CDM." --&gt; LCDM doesn't predict what galaxies should look like, it simply predicts how much mass is in collapsed structures and that dark matter haloes grow hierarchically. In contrast, with JWST we see light and need to infer what the underlying properties of the system are. It was shown very early on that the theoretical upper limit (i.e. taking all of the gas that is available in collapsed structures and turning it into stars) predicts a luminosity function (i.e. number of galaxies per unit luminosity) that is orders of above what JWST has observed (e.g. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521..497M/abstra...). This means that there is plenty of space within the context of LCDM to have bright and seemingly large and massive galaxies early on. Based on current JWST data at these early epochs, there are really no convincing arguments for or against LCDM because it's highly sensitive to the galaxy formation model that's adopted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My hangup with MOND is still general relativity. We know for a fact that gravity is _not_ Newtonian, that the inverse square law does not hold. Any model of gravity based on an inverse law is simply wrong.Another comment linked to https://tritonstation.com/new-blog-page/, which is an excellent read. It makes the case that GR has never been tested at low accelerations, that is might be wrong. But we know for a fact MOND is wrong at high accelerations. Unless your theory can cover both, I don't see how it can be pitched as an improvement to GR.Edit: this sounds a bit hostile. to be clear, I think modified gravity is absolutely worth researching. but it isn't a silver bullet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;« Stunning evidence » 
… then later on:
« Instead, the readings _seem_ to support a basis for MOND, which _would_ force astronomers and cosmologists to reconsider this alternative and long-controversial theory of gravity. »
What’s conditional evidence? I may be missing the overall picture, but I view such writing as non precise at its best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42158130</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;NumPyro is a probabilistic programming library built on NumPy that combines the flexibility of NumPy with the power of PyTorch for scalable Bayesian inference. It allows users to define probabilistic models using a simple syntax, enabling effective Bayesian inference via NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) and other techniques. The library is designed for speed and ease of use, catering to researchers and practitioners in machine learning and statistics, and it emphasizes both performance and extensibility to accommodate various modeling needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the examples are in R, the same concepts apply to Pyro (and NumPyro)[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26619686-statistical-ret...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related question: are there there any algorithms / optimizations for probabilistic programming in an online context?What i mean is that I have a model and I've run my inference on my historical data. Now I have new observations streaming in and I want to update my inference in an efficient manner. Basically I'd like something like a Kalman Filter for general probabilistic models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those with more experience how does (Num)Pyro compare with PyMC? I haven’t had the good fortune of working with any of these libraries since before Pyro (and presumably numpyro), and with PyMC3 back when it used Theano under the hood.Are the two libraries in competition? Or complimentary? I’ve been playing with PyMC for a personal project and am curious what I might gain from investigating (Num)Pyro?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42156126</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi all, I'm the author of llama-ocr. Thank you for sharing &amp; for the kind comments! I built this earlier this week since I wanted a simple API to do OCR – it uses llama 3.2 vision (hosted on together.ai, where i work) to parse images into structured markdown. I also have it available as an npm package.Planning to add a bunch of other features like the ability to parse PDFs, output a response in JSON, ect... If anyone has any questions, feel free to send them and I'll try to respond!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a bit of a quirk: I uploaded a webcomic as an example, all the dialog was ALL CAPS, but the output was inconsistently either sentence case or title case between panels.I also tried some real examples a problem I'd like to use OCR with: I've got some old slides that needs digitising, and most of them are labelled, uploading one of these provides the output:  The image appears to be a photograph of a slide or film frame, possibly from an old camera or projector. The slide is yellowed with age and has a rectangular cutout in the center, which is filled with a dark gray or black material. The cutout is surrounded by a thin border, and there is some text written on the slide in black ink.

  The text reads "Once Upon a Time" and is written in a cursive font. It is located at the bottom of the slide, below the cutout. There is also a small number "1069" written in the same font and color, but it is not clear what this number refers to.

  Overall, the image suggests that the slide is an old photograph or film frame that has been preserved for many years. The yellowing of the slide and the cursive writing suggest that it may be from the early 20th century or earlier.

So aside from unnecessary repetitious description of the slide, (and the "yellowing" is actually just white balance being off, though I can forgive that), the actual written text (not cursive) was "Once Uniquitous." and the number was 106g. It's very clearly a 'g' and not a '9'.What I think is interesting about this is that it might be a demonstration of biases in models, it focuses too much on the slide being an antique that it hallucinated a completely cliche title. Also, it missed the forest for the trees and that the "black square" was the slide being front-lit so the text could be read, so the transparency wasn't visible.Additionally, the API itself seems to have file size or resolution limits that are not documented&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very funny. I put in 3 screen captures of a (long) document, and it did relatively well. But when I proof-read it, I realized the AI has made up passages that were not there!The reason is probably due to the nature of screen capturing, some sentences or paragraphs were cut short. That probably kicked off the “fill in the blank” nature of the LLM and it could not resist to leave these paragraphs stand unfinished :LOL. It even put in a short conclusion paragraph that was not in the original document at all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42154410</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The SQL above results in a plan similar to the DuckDB optimized plan, but it is wordier and more error-prone to write, which can potentially lead to bugs.FWIW, aside from manual filter pushdown, I consider the JOIN variant the canonical / "default" way to merge multiple tables; it keeps all the join-related logic in one place, while mixing both joining conditions and filtering conditions in WHERE always felt more error-prone to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always a fan of query plan articles!Note: the dig at dataframe libs is worth some care in case you think that means duckdb can optimize and they cannotDask, Polars, and others pick a lazy default in order to make distribution and other optimizations easier. When staying in their pure fragments ('vectorized'), the same scheduler rewriting opportunity is here.This is a subtle but important distinction when looking at these frameworks. We are making our new graph query language 'gfql' to be dataframe-native so it can run naturally &amp; natively as a step of pipelines people are already doing, but also to ensure we automatically run as optimized CPU/GPU columnar opts. At the same time, because of the intent to allow room for query plan optimization, we are staying declarative / lazy, even if the generated &amp; interpreted code uses an eager DF runtime . I'm optimistic about output target lazy DF systems doing query planner work for us long-term here, but for the eager framework targets, the query planning has to be on our side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta: I think the title would be better here if it came out and said query optimizers.That gives a less subtle clue that it's about databases than looking at the domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42156430</guid></item><item><title>14.

As I understand it, shifting the red curve to shorter wavelengths, even by a seemingly small amount, would improve visibility. And something I've learned is that red vision varies by a fair amount from person to person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does this mean better motion response times?

&lt;p&gt;The article on the Quansight Labs blog explains the concept of "groupby" operations in pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It delves into the importance of grouping data to perform aggregate functions, transformation, or filtering operations on subsets of data. The piece includes practical examples demonstrating how to use the groupby method effectively, highlighting various aggregation functions and providing insights on managing grouped data to derive meaningful results in data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did non trivial work with apache spark dataframes and came to appreciate them before ever being exposed to Pandas. After spark, pandas just seemed frustrating and incomprehensible. Polars is much more like spark and I am very happy about that.DuckDb even goes so far as to include a clone of the pyspark dataframe API, so somebody there must like it too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pandas sat alone in the Python ecosphere for a long time. Lack of competition is generally not a good thing. I'm thrilled to have Polars around to innovate on the API end (and push Pandas to be better).And I say this as someone who makes much of their living from Pandas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The difference is a sanely and presciently designed expression API, which is a bit more verbose in some common cases, but is more predictable and much more expressive in more complex situations like this.On a tangent, i wonder what this op would look like in SQL? Probably would need support for filtering in a window function, which I'm not sure is standardized?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42152076</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to investigate Microsoft's cloud computing business, focusing on potential anti-competitive practices. The inquiry follows concerns raised about Microsoft's dominance in the cloud market and its impact on competition. This move reflects the ongoing scrutiny of large tech companies and aims to ensure fair competition in the technology sector, particularly as Microsoft continues to expand its cloud services and potentially stifle rival firms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a great book, but my personal opinion is that it would have benefited from an editor that recommended some small changes. The previous edition had a TOC which was barely usable because all funny jokes in chapter names like "8 Conditional Manatees". Besides, there were too many jokes embedded in some sections, which made them difficult to follow. I think some of these issues are getting addressed in the current edition.Nonetheless, the book is very well written and all figures and examples show great attention to detail. I found Gelman et al Regression and Other Stories better for teaching newcomers, and surprisingly insightful. Statistical Rethinking is a good choice for a second course, but perhaps too informal at that stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've taken the course and love the book. The key takeaways for me were to shun cleverness in favour of building demonstrably sensible models out of simple parts and clear causal assumptions. There's a lot of using models as random generators as a way to validate assumptions that demonstrates that your model makes sense before you start with inferencing which is a fantastic habit to stick with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

A year or two ago I tried to use this in production and it was very buggy.The basic selling point is a compositional query language, so that over-time one may have a library of re-usable components. If anyone really has built such a library I'd love to know more about how it worked out in practice. It isn't obvious to me how those decorators are supposed to compose and abstract on first look.Its also not immediately obvious to me how complicated your library of SQL has to be for this approach to make sense. Say I had a collection of 100 moderately complex and correlated SQL queries, and I was to refactor them into Logica, in what circumstances would it yield a substantial benefit versus (1) doing nothing, (2) creating views or stored procedures, (3) using DBT / M4 or some other preprocessor for generic abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Google is pushing the new language Logica to solve the major flaws in SQL - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29715957 - Dec 2021 (1 comment)Logica, a novel open-source logic programming language - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26805121 - April 2021 (98 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If, like me, your first reaction is that this looks suspiciously like Datalog then you may be interested to learn that they indeed consider Logical to be "in the the Datalog family".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42158445</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article explains, poorly, _what_ public key cryptography is but not _how_ public key cryptography really works, at all.Saying that Natasha and Boris both choose a prime number and then "create a safe" with it, is the same as telling someone that to make cake Alice and Bob went to the store and bought flour and eggs.If you want a real, good and visual explanation of _how_ it works, with simple maths, go watch Computerphile's video[0] about Diffie-Hellman.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As usual with Quanta, the actual article didn’t explain anything well and was a waste of time (which is funny because Quanta is usually off the deep end with pages of esoteric babble that is gibberish except to genuine specialists. In this case, not only was there no ‘simple math’ - there was no math!). I’ve really got to stop clicking on Quanta links.For an actually well written and deeply informative ‘how it works’ for public key cryptography, see:https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?em...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was expecting a real example using some actual numbers and simple operations to demonstrate how this works. Instead there are a couple of vague metaphors that don’t explain much about the actual math involved beyond “multiply two primes”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42153577</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always found it really frustrating that a "zero tolerance" policy to bullying seemed to disproportionately affect people who eventually fight back.I would guess it's a combination of "nobody sees the first hit" (since your attention is elsewhere, of course) and that bullies get quite good at testing boundaries and thus know how to avoid detection.But, really, it's truly frustrating that as I child I was bullied relentlessly, and when I finally took my parents advice and stood my ground, I was expelled from school (due to zero tolerance). Those bullies continued to torment some other kids, of course.This is far from an uncommon situation, over the years I've heard many more scenarios like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dang who would have thought teachers looking the other way and pretending it wasn’t happening wasn’t an effective deterrent for future bullying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many years ago, one of the popular news shows (Dateline or 20/20, I can never remember which) did a special on bullying.They showed one elementary school where the entire organization (teachers, students, staff etc) implemented some kind of holistic approach to bullying that actually worked. They even interviewed a group of kids where they said "Oh yeah, Tom used to be the bully and we were all afraid of him but now we're all best friends".I don't remember the exact plan implemented but it struck me as both simple and common sense with excellent outcomes.Despite much searching on IMDB, Twitter, Google and even using LLMs, I have yet to find the exact episode. Now that I have kids of my own, I'm even more interested in finding it. Any suggestions from the HN crowd?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42156640</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses techniques for debugging dynamically linked applications using GDB (GNU Debugger). It emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between static and dynamic linking, and how this affects the debugging process. The author provides practical tips for setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and navigating through dynamic libraries. Additionally, it highlights common pitfalls when dealing with debugger outputs and offers advice on how to utilize GDB's features effectively for troubleshooting complex issues in applications.&lt;/p&gt;

They aren't very difficult to write (once you grasp the basics of the GDB API and compiler debug info flags), and they're a very cheap way to make reasonably pleasant representations of data structures. Although "cheap" is not "free", like these sort of tools are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't use GDB a lot. But when I do, I generally use the pwndb extension.
It's written for exploit development, but even for debugging a C program.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the origins and significance of the epigraph from W. Somerset Maugham's short story "Appointment in Samarra." It delves into the themes of fate, the inevitability of death, and the impact of choices on one's life journey. The epigraph serves as a poignant reminder of how one's attempts to escape destiny can often lead to their downfall. The piece also examines various interpretations and reactions to the epigraph throughout literary history, showcasing its enduring relevance and power in conveying existential themes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the epigraph: https://www.k-state.edu/english/baker/english320/Maugham-AS.....I was thinking of this legend because, somewhat improbably, it shows up in the last 20 seconds of the video for "Particle Man": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsAiCs66l40 (thanks pvg!)Here's a melodramatic rendition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLeVHqiAGcY.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weird that this obscure story has been on my mind a lot lately as a way of describing the effects of depression. in the zeitgeist perhaps.The essential version of the story is quoted at the end:&gt; There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the market-place I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went. Then the merchant went down to the market-place and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.the link between the 'Appointment in Samara' story and depression is that it's a sense of damnation that finds a way to catch up with you, and when you find some escape or even come through it, the consequences of things you neglected under its influence come due. The story is a bit trite, as like the servant it's easy to say we fool ourselves. I'd say it's less easy to apprehend the layered mendacity of a malevolent presence that hates you, but the story captures some of the dynamic well.It's a wry observation about what we do to ourselves, but having given it some oddly specific thought, it's more useful as a metaphor for articulating and black boxing a game that this thing can set us up to play and lose. Perhaps a bit personal and TMI, but if someone's going to talk about Appointment in Sarmarra today, it's worth looking at it with a contemporary lens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Btw, is it very hard to read and make sense of these texts for native speakers too? Even in my first language these stories sound unlike just a foreign speech, as if not only languages diverged with time, but the whole concept of speech (writing at least) evolved and became more clear in our time, imo.Interesting if that affected general development and progress and how will future languages look like, or it was the other way round. I guess it may e.g. become even more logical and circumstantial in structure and remove obvious uncertainties (like “do not X and Y” can mean “do” or “do not” to Y) in favor of cfg-ness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101902</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the Apple Watch came out, I wanted to build something like this. Of course, an idea being an idea, I didn't.Anyway, my idea was this: one drunken night in Berkeley, a neuroscience PhD told me that it was possible to put a patch of electrodes on the back of a blind person. If a camera fed those electrodes, the person would eventually learn to decode that into something like sight.That got me thinking about using a similar patch, except on your arm (for convenience), except for audio, and for people who _could_ hear. The idea was that it would amplify what you heard and make you hear it better. We would quickly learn what the signals from the patch mean. In time, maybe, the patch could be used to deliver auditory information that was _not_ merely an amplification of what the person heard.I am not 100% sure but I think Meta has been building something similar for a while. Their recent AR glasses showed off a wrist device that could read signals, but I could swear they were also looking into a device that could transmit signals to the skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If they could shrink the actuators down to a finer resolution they might have something. Theree “tactils” per square inch seems rather crude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come on, when can we use this for games?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42158366</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the notion that large language models (LLMs) can effectively design semiconductor chips as suggested by Y Combinator. It highlights the complexity of chip design, emphasizing the need for deep domain expertise and the limitations of LLMs in understanding intricate physical and engineering challenges. The author contends that while LLMs can assist in certain aspects of the design process, they cannot replace the nuanced decision-making and strategic thinking required for successful chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LLMs have a long way to go in the world of EDA.A few months ago I saw a post on LinkedIn where someone fed the leading LLMs a counter-intuitively drawn circuit with 3 capacitors in parallel and asked what the total capacitance was. Not a single one got it correct - not only did they say the caps were in series (they were not) it even got the series capacitance calculations wrong. I couldn’t believe they whiffed it and had to check myself and sure enough I got the same results as the author and tried all types of prompt magic to get the right answer… no dice.I also saw an ad for an AI tool that’s designed to help you understand schematics. In its pitch to you, it’s showing what looks like a fairly generic guitar distortion pedal circuit and does manage to correctly identify a capacitor as blocking DC but failed to mention it also functions as a component in an RC high-pass filter. I chuckled when the voice over proudly claims “they didn’t even teach me this in 4 years of Electrical Engineering!” (Really? They don’t teach how capacitors block DC and how RC filters work????)If you’re in this space you probably need to compile your own carefully curated codex and train something more specialized. The general purpose ones struggle too much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t mind LLMs in the ideation and learning phases, which aren’t reproducible anyway. But I still find it hard to believe engineers of all people are eager to put a slow, expensive, non-deterministic black box right at the core of extremely complex systems that need to be reliable, inspectable, understandable…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on the Qualcomm DSP architecture team for a year, so I have a little experience with this area but not a ton.The author here is missing a few important things about chip design. Most of the time spent and work done is not writing high performance Verilog. Designers spent a huge amount of time answering questions, writing documentation, copying around boiler plate, reading obscure manuals and diagrams, etc. LLMs can already help with all of those things.I believe that LLMs in their current state could help design teams move at least twice as fast, and better tools could probably change that number to 4x or 10x even with no improvement in the intelligence of models. Most of the benefit would come from allowing designers to run more experiments and try more things, to get feedback on design choices faster, to spend less time documenting and communicating, and spend less time reading poorly written documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42156516</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a worldview, defining it as a comprehensive framework through which individuals interpret and understand the world. It emphasizes that a worldview consists of core beliefs and values that shape perceptions, decisions, and behaviors. The piece breaks down the components of a worldview, including origins, purpose, morality, and destiny, and explains how these elements interact to form a cohesive understanding of reality. Additionally, it highlights the importance of examining and reflecting on one's own worldview to foster critical thinking and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42155843"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After a recent argument with my brother in which he kept insisting we lived in different moral and factual realities, I've become much more interested in who and what we allow to form our worldview than what it ends up being. I realized during our conversation that he was citing mainstream media news sources, whereas I was citing primary sources. For example, we were talking about a change in a law and I was comparing the actual text of the law before and after the change, and he was citing commentary on it, or he was telling me he didn't believe certain things ever happened, and I was citing research data that said they actually happen consistently.I don't know how to speak to what someone has allowed to create the "reality" they believe they live in when it's abstracted away from primary sources. It would be one thing if he were citing different studies, different research, different legal records, but he's not. He's saying if a commenter he likes/trusts interprets something one way, it doesn't matter if there are facts that prove otherwise.Ironically, our dad is the same way, just with the politically opposite set of non-primary sources my brother relies on, and it frustrates my brother to no end. But if the foundations of each of their worldviews are several levels abstracted from the original source material, how are they ever going to live in the same "reality"?It was the first time in a long time that I've realized just how removed from what actually happens so many people are. So few people are actually even looking at primary sources anymore, and partially because they've become so hard to find beneath all the layers of commentary on them. But how are we ever supposed to talk about reality if we can't even agree what counts?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  And while anyone can observe the very significant differences in income and wealth among individuals, on its own that observation implies nothing under the constrained vision in which “equality” is seen as a “process characteristic” (everyone is treated equally), but is proof positive of injustice in the unconstrained vision, where equality is seen as a “result characteristic” (everyone achieves equal outcomes).

I think she puts her finger on a really fundamental divide here. I see variations on this theme argued about constantly, and neither side seems influenced by the other's arguments. On one extreme a rich man's wealth is evidence of his good character, on the other, his bad character. These world views can't be reconciled except by moral contortionists. If we let each camp vote for their own government the results would be at least as different as Kamala and Donald.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A flagged/dead comment alleged that this was written by an LLM.While I disagree, I don't think that their accusation was made in bad faith. This article reads like someone whose only human interactions are borne from text books and discussions with others about what comes from the text books.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42155843</guid></item><item><title>31.

The first is that if you are under 40 you will never encounter a physician who believes you are at risk of heart attack or stroke, even though over 100,000 Americans under 40 will experience such an incident each year. The second is that even if you get a heart attack or stroke due to their negligence they will never be liable because that calculator is considered the standard of care in malpractice law!Governing bodies write these guidelines that act like programs, and your local doctor is the interpreter.[1] When was the last time you found a bug that could be attributed to the interpreter rather than the programmer?[0] https://tools.acc.org/ascvd-risk-estimator-plus/#!/calculate...[1] It’s worth considering what medical schools, emergency rooms, and malpractice lawyers are analogous to in this metaphor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &gt; The choice of a 5-year period seems to be because of data availability

I would be very hesitant to entrust something like organ matching to a singular matching system.There are so many ways to get it wrong - bad data, bad algo design/requirements, mistakes in implementation, people understanding the system too well being able to game it, etc.Human systems have biases, but at least there are diverse biases when there are many decision makers.  If you put something important behind a single algorithm, you are locking in a fixed bias inadvertently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110797</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The completely agrammatical "Latin" text in the AARO logo - somewhere on the level of English text one might find on a t-shirt sold on a street market in rural China - does not inspire confidence in the programme or its mission, as it suggests that* some person in a high-up position is driven by a caricature of a notion of legitimacy conveyed by grandiose Latin mottos;* this person does not have the diligence or attention to detail to be able to construct such a motto correctly, nor the capability for reflection to anticipate that he would fail to do so;* either there is not enough of a culture of skepticism or criticism for anyone else to point out the mistakes and pull the emergency brakes, or there are not enough eyeballs even on fundamental materials like the programme's logo.These are not features you want in a working group that you trust to sift through vague and contentious evidence on a topic marred by wishful thinking and military obscurantism. The group's findings therefore don't seem worth putting much stock in, and the main information that is conveyed by this is that there exist more amateurish and untrustworthy initiatives under the US military's aegis than one would expect.(The motto itself seems to have come from a misremembered or ineptly modded Marcus Aurelius quote popular in motivational posters: https://ehoreka.myshopify.com/products/mundus-mutatur-vita-n...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basically, some EO sensors, some radar systems, RF spectrum monitoring and some ADS-B to calibrate against identifiable aircraft.This is OK.It can probably tell you "that's definitely something we understand". It can count things where it can't, and give you a little data to help you understand if it's something understandable, but rare enough to not be already in your system taxonomy.It isn't enough to establish what a UAP is, but will give you an idea of the frequency of things you should probably spend more time and money and effort into identifying.Interesting thing is, if you identify some hot spots of UAP activity through this, you can then start to collect more data, and then perhaps we can figure out what is going on: UAP are real, we know that thanks to the more honest, open and frank disclosures made in recent years. You don't need to believe they're of ET origin to believe they are a potential threat to [inter-]national security infrastructure. It's astonishing to me its taking this long to get this far, to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Annie Jacobsen Book "Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military has an interesting take on UFOs.

Deus vult!”ah social media, some people are truly as dumb as rocks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm interested to see how Bluesky ends up handling bad actors in the long-term. Will they have the resources to keep up? Or will it become polluted like the other large platforms.Also, if a part of their business model will be based off selling algorithmic feeds, won't that mean more spam is actually good for their bottom line because they'll sell more algorithmic feeds that counter the spam?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to how easy it is to setup accounts and post on Bluesky, it’s likely many of the same operatives behind the propaganda and bot armies on Twitter are now pushing the same vitriolic content, and triggering these reports.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the inability of M1 and M2 Macs to virtualize older versions of macOS due to architectural differences. It explains that while Intel-based Macs can use virtualization software to run older macOS versions for testing or compatibility purposes, M-series Macs are limited by a lack of support for the older macOS kernels in their ARM-based architecture. The piece highlights the implications for users who rely on virtual machines for running legacy software and suggests alternative approaches to access older macOS environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commenters lament that Rosetta will go away before users are ready.In my opinion, Rosetta should be more heavily gated* to push everyone from Adobe to Steam to build for aarch64.  Countless "Apple Silicon native" claiming tools require Rosetta under the hood for dependencies or even (bless their hearts) only their installer.* Like right-click to open packages or install not-from app store, except Rosetta dialog should note that once it's installed any other old software not made for this system will run without warning.  Turns out avoiding Rosetta is a great way to ensure not just apps but your CLI tools are all up to date... Alternatively, make Rosetta sandboxed with apps, and/or let it be turned off again more reasonably than the safe-mode surgery required now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It seems that M4 chips can’t virtualise any version of macOS before 13.4 Ventura13.4 was released on May 18, 2023. That's actually not very far into the past.Anyway, what would be the most common use cases for this? And how common are those?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago we added `GOAMD64=v3` [1] to how we build our go binary into docker images, as all our production servers have support to that and that can give us some free performance boost.Then it turned out Rosetta does not support that, so those docker images can no longer run on developers' mac laptops, so we have to revert it back. This is why we can't have nice things (we don't use any arm server so we never bothered to build multi-platform docker image).[1]: https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements#amd64&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42157086</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive study on the efficiency of supervised learning techniques in handling imbalanced data. It explores various methods to improve classification performance when dealing with classes that are not evenly distributed. Key findings indicate that certain approaches, such as synthetic data generation and ensemble methods, significantly enhance model accuracy and robustness. The authors also discuss the implications of these results for practical applications in various fields, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate strategies to address imbalance issues effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My master thesis was on using machine learning techniques to synthesise quantum circuits. Since any operation on a QC can be represented as a unitary matrix my research topic was that, using ML, given a set of gates, how many and in what arrangement of them you could generate or at least approximate this matrix. Another aspect was, given a unitary matrix, could a neural network predict a number of gates needed to simulate that matrix as a QC and thereby give us a measure of complexity. It was a lot of fun to test different algorithms from genetic algorithms to neural network architectures. Back then NNs were a lot smaller and I trained them mostly on one GPU and since the matrices get exponentially bigger with the amount of qbits in the circuit it was only possible for me to investigate small circuits with less than a dozen qubits but it was still nice to see that in principle this worked quite well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outside of a few odd citations in the intro (which is innocuous) I don't see anything shady or dishonest in this paper after a cursory skimming. But I do worry about 60% of the authors being NVIDIA employees, where the corresponding author is not a staff scientist, but rather a "technical marketing engineer" whose job "focuses on inspiring developers by sharing examples of how NVIDIA quantum technologies can accelerate research."[1] So I am wondering about what articles didn't make it to this review, where ANN/GPU-accelerated QC research didn't work very well or was too expensive to justify. It makes me suspect I am being advertised to, and that this paper must be read with an unusually high degree of scrutiny.Like I said: there's nothing obviously shady or dishonest here. But this is also an arXiv paper, so no need for authors to disclose conflicts of interest. (OpenAI has pioneered the technique of using the arXiv to distribute academic infomercials with zero scientific value.) And I worry about the distortion this stuff has on honest scientific work. Bell Labs was always an independent subsidiary: Bell's marketing staff did not take ownership of Bell Labs' research. The fact that NVIDIA's marketer has a PhD and an "engineer" title doesn't actually mitigate any of this.[1] https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/mawolf/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most remarkable thing is using frontier models to write and then run code on quantum computers (eg IBM’s). It’s amazing — you can even teach with a “creative coding” approach (without the multiple courses in quantum physics).It’s not even the code that is the hardest part. In general, it is very difficult to frame a given problem domain (ie, any other field of science or optimization problem) as a problem addressable with a quantum computer. Quantum computer scientists have not made this easy—with LLMs, it still isn’t trivial, but it is a huge leap in accessibility.Warning: LLMs hallucinate a ton within this area. Many things can go wrong. But the fact that sometimes they are correct is amazing to me.We’ve run some studies showing the importance of expertise in this area: participants with quantum background and coding skills were much more effective at solving quantum problems with LLMs than novices, for instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42155909</guid></item><item><title>38.

If this takes more than a paragraph I assume your project is tinkerers-only stuff that's going to need maintenance, so I like to show off how few steps are needed.The quotes are mostly flavor/Easter eggs, but they do have a function breaking up the wall of text feeling, as a more fun alternative to whitespace that also acts as a visual marker with a recognizable texture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i make these headings and write down the answers:  what is it
  how do i install it
  how do i use it
    any "pro-tips"/useful stuff to know
  how do i get help (optional)
  acknowledgements etc (optional)

too often i see things skip the "what is it" part&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would call it "an easy way to create a very full featured README" because it's not easier than just loading a snippet or template in ones text editor, but it does offer a very easy way to add specific sections and to customize them.The "Get Started" button goes right to the editor with three panes: list of sections to include, plain text editor for the current section, and rendered preview. There's no sign up, and the results can be downloaded directly. Very nicely done little app.I felt the default sections were missing something, so I easily created this:    ## Dad Jokes

&lt;p&gt;The paper titled "Attention is All You Need" introduces the Transformer model, a novel architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence found in traditional models like RNNs and LSTMs. This architecture allows for parallelization during training and improves the handling of longer sequences. The authors demonstrate that the Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as machine translation, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in natural language processing. The work presents new methods for attention and showcases the performance of the model through various experiments, marking a significant advancement in deep learning approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strategy this paper seems to be describing is well known as “chasing steam”. You keep an eye on the odds at a “sharp” book, one that’s good at tracking which clients of theirs often win and adjust their odds accordingly, then find books that are slower to adjust their odds. There’s a long tail of “pay per head” bookies, basically your classic street corner bookie but with a SaaS for taking bets, and they’re often the slowest to adjust.The problem is that identifying this is very easy for a sports book. Basically “show me all accounts that consistently make bets right before we adjust the odds” and then they ban/limit those accounts. In practice the heavy lifting for winning sports bettors is building a network of “outs” or players that will place bets on their behalf. The idea is that you have a recreational bettor (i.e. bets for fun and usually loses) that puts down a bet on your behalf with your money, and if it wins they get to keep a slice. This masks the sharp bets with their personal bad bets.Really the strategy to beat the odds is one of the easiest parts of the equation. It’s good old fashion people management that’s the biggest part of what makes it work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but this is literally how the market becomes more efficient: by allowing participants with more information and reducing the arbitrage opportunities.The bookmakers don't set the odds based on their own expectations, they set the odds compared to how the market bets and then add their own margin on top (the "vig"). Just like a stockbroker would.In sports betting, compared to financial markets, the general reason why people aren't wildly successful is that if they have too much of an edge the bookmakers find some way to limit their succes (limited bet sizes, banning, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prediction markets like Polymarket solve this by not having bookies. Just bet against other players.Why bet against a house who takes an enormous cut even when you win when you could bet in an efficient market and keep 100% of your winnings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112855</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a critical analysis of the placebo effect, arguing that its often-celebrated benefits may not be as significant or reliable as assumed. It examines the mechanisms behind the placebo phenomenon, questioning whether the improvements in patient outcomes attributed to placebo treatment are genuine or the result of various biases and expectations. The piece emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of placebo effects within clinical practice and research, highlighting potential ethical concerns and implications for treatment efficacy. Ultimately, it calls for a reassessment of the placebo effect's role in medicine and the importance of evidence-based approaches to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this essay is valuable in helping me clarify just what is meant by placebo effects, and their putative biological mechanisms and processes.The arguments should not be summarily dismissed (a lot of thinking and research went into this essay). The arguments should be taken apart and critiqued individually.In particular I agree with the key idea that it is important to critically evsluate the strength of evidence and the strength of experimental designs that favor long-lasting functional placebo effects.If a design is a perfectly implemented triple-blinded study (https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/double-blind-study/) in which a reliable outcome measure is significantly affected with a reasonably large effect size—-for example, a Cohen’s d score above 0.2) then the evidence in favor would be pretty compelling (https://www.statology.org/interpret-cohens-d/). And very compelling us independently replicated in a second case/control study.But how many studies reach this level? I doubt that there are any in animal model research with which I am more familiar.If “faith and prayer” are regarded as a placebo effect then how much does this reduce the incidence and impact of illness when controlling well for socioeconomic factors? Was COVID severity modulated by said factors (or ivermectin ;-) ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might be true, but I don't think the case presented here is very compelling.The general problem is it interprets the evidence to fit the conclusion: studies showing a placebo effect are interpreted as having bad methodology while ones showing no effect are interpreted as having correct methodology.Of course, study design can exaggerate the effect. Does that mean it's doesn't exist, though?Probably the more general problem is that contrarian views get clicks (and all that goes with that) which creates an unfortunate incentive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who potentially contributed to the placebo effect for a study she was in.She was in a study to see if a vitamin supplement would have a beneficial effect to a condition she suffered. She didn’t know if she was getting placebo or the supplement so after two weeks of not feeling any positive effect, she decided to start taking additional supplements of the vitamin in question on her own next to the study tablets to “be sure”. I remember choking on my coffee when she casually told me this later. I’m a scientist and it never occurred to me that anyone would act like this in a study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42157012</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the value of reading "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman, emphasizing its profound impact on understanding programming principles and concepts. The author advocates that the book is worth reading multiple times due to its depth and the insights it offers into computational thinking, abstraction, and the philosophical aspects of programming. The piece highlights the importance of grappling with the material to fully appreciate its teachings, suggesting that the book not only enhances technical skills but also fosters a broader comprehension of computer science as a discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting, SICP and other many other “classic” texts talk about designing programs, but these days I think the much more important skill is designing systems.I don’t know if distributed systems is consider part of “Computer Science” but it is a much more common problem that I see needs to be solved.I try to write systems in the simplest way possible and then use observability tools to figure out where the design is deficient and then maybe I will pull out a data structure or some other “computer sciency” thing to solve that problem. It turns out that big O notation and runtime complexity doesn’t matter the majority of the time and you can solve most problems with arrays and fast CPUs. And even when you have runtime problems you should profile the program to find the hot spots.What computer science doesn’t teach you is how memory caching works in CPUs. Your fancy graph algorithm may have good runtime complexity but it completely hoses the CPU cache and you may have been able to go faster with an array with good cache usage.The much more common problems I have is how to deal with fault tolerance, correctness in distributed locks and queues, and system scalability.Maybe I am just biased because I have a computer/electrical engineering background.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article has a broken link for the free copy:https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/b...https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdfI hadn't seen a blessed PDF version until today.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised by the complexity of Go's generic constraints, given the language's focus on simplicity. Things like the difference between "implementing" and "satisfying" a constraint [0], and exceptions around what a constraint can contain [1]:&gt; A union (with more than one term) cannot contain the predeclared identifier comparable or interfaces that specify methods, or embed comparable or interfaces that specify methods.Is this level of complexity unavoidable when implementing generics (in any language)? If not, could it have been avoided if Go's design had included generics from the start?[0] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77445861/whats-the-diffe...[1] https://blog.merovius.de/posts/2024-01-05_constraining_compl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i have been writing Go exclusively for 5+ years and to this day i use generics only in a dedicated library that works with arrays(slices in Go world) and provides basic functionality like pop, push, shift, reverse, filter and so on.Other than that, generics have not really solved an actual problem for me in the real world. Nice to have, but too mush fuss about nothing relevant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like in Go how the code looks like a execution graph, by avoiding smarts and just copying code, when you have an error in the log you can generally just follow it through the code as there is only one path to get there. In C# I would have mostly to debug to understand where did it came fromNot just because of the language, but of the simplify culture. Let's see how generics will change that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162878</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a key observation that is simple and intuitive:&gt;All CLIP-like models perform poorly on mixed-modality search due to a phenomenon known as the modality gap. As illustrated in the figure below, the closest vector to the snippet “I address you, members of the Seventy-Seventh Congress…” is not its screenshot, but other texts. This leads to search results that are skewed towards items of the same modality; in other words, text vectors will be closer to irrelevant texts than relevant images in the embedding space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in that space, would throw our project in the mix which uses ColPali under the hood transparently.https://github.com/tjmlabs/ColiVaraThe main benchmark for this is the Vidore leaderboard. Where we would love to see where VoyageAI performs compared to the more open-source implementations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm missing something. Shouldn't any llm that's 'natively multimodal' somehow include embeddings which are multi-modal? for ex here's googles blogpost on Gemini  Until now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved 
  training separate components for different modalities and then stitching them 
  together to roughly mimic some of this functionality. These models can 
  sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like describing images, but  
  struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning.

  We designed Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on 
  different modalities. Then we fine-tuned it with additional multimodal data to 
  further refine its effectiveness. This helps Gemini seamlessly understand and 
  reason about all kinds of inputs from the ground up, far better than existing 
  multimodal models — and its capabilities are state of the art in nearly every 
  domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162622</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "bpftune" by Oracle provides a tool designed to optimize eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs by automatically adjusting various parameters for improved performance. The repository includes instructions for installation, usage, and contribution, as well as example configurations for different environments. It aims to simplify the tuning process for developers and system administrators working with eBPF, enhancing their ability to monitor and manage system performance in Linux environments.&lt;/p&gt;

And in ways I'm unaware of. Is this a reasonable hesitation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two words: “feedback loop”.That was the first idea that jumped in when thinking in what could go wrong, not because the Linux kernel, or BPF or this program, just for how it is intended to work. There might be no risk of that happening, there may be controls around that, or if they happen they might only converge to an estable state, but still it is something to have in the map.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to step into control theory, which I think is somewhat underapplied in software engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42163597</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warning: Diving into SCIP/Lisp/Scheme can transform how you think about programming... food for thought is always welcomed! But applying those ideas wholesale to OOP codebases often backfires or gets pushback from teammates. Languages handle paradigms differently, and going against the grain usually leads to worse code.Example: After Lisp, you might replace every for loop with forEach or chain everything through map/reduce. But unless you’re working in a language that fully embraces functional programming, this approach can hurt both readability and performance.At the end of the day, it’s grounding to remember there’s mutable memory and a CPU processing the code. These days, I find data-oriented design and “mechanical sympathy” (aligning code with hardware realities) more practical day-to-day than more abstract concepts like Church numerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've watched the actual SICP lectures before (the 1986 recordings on MIT OCW). They're often praised for the information density, but it actually still wastes a lot of time listening to students' Q&amp;A, the lecturers drawing the class' attention to various attempts at "multimedia" presentation in the classroom, simply not having the entire lesson plan worked out in advance (i.e., not being able to preempt the Q&amp;A) etc. For that matter, the sheer amount of time spent on writing things on a chalkboard really adds up.And of course the order of the material could be debated and rearranged countless ways. One of my future planned projects is to do my own video series presenting the material according to my own sensibilities.It's nice to hear that the course apparently still stays true to its roots while using more current languages like Python. Python is designed as a pragmatic, multi-paradigm language and I think people often don't give it enough credit for its expressive power using FP idioms (if not with complete purity).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They give a nice introduction to encoding state as pure functions. In fact, there are many more purely functional encodings for all kinds of data like trees, integers, sum/product types, images, monads, ...The encodings can be a bit confusing, but really elegant and tiny at the same time. Take for example a functional implementation of the Maybe monad in javascript:  Nothing = nothing =&gt; just =&gt; nothing
  Just = v =&gt; nothing =&gt; just =&gt; just(v)
  
  pure = Just
  bind = mx =&gt; f =&gt; mx(mx)(f)
  
  evalMaybe = maybe =&gt; maybe("Nothing")(v =&gt; "Just " + v)
  console.log(evalMaybe(bind(Nothing)(n =&gt; pure(n + 1)))) // Nothing
  console.log(evalMaybe(bind(Just(42))(n =&gt; pure(n + 1)))) // Just 43&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42164541</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article from Atlas Obscura discusses echolocation, a skill typically associated with bats and dolphins, that can also be learned and utilized by humans. It explains the process of using sound waves to navigate and identify objects in one’s environment through techniques such as making clicking sounds or using other auditory cues. The article highlights examples of individuals who have developed echolocation abilities and provides insights into the science behind this sensory adaptation, emphasizing its potential benefits for those with visual impairments. Additionally, it offers practical tips on how to practice echolocation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is often used by audio mixing engineers and taught in a roundabout way at schools and studios. We think a lot about where thins “sit” in the mix. Proximity wise, and even height wise in a stereo mix.
 Eventually you learn how to locate things in headphones and it’s a really weird sensation when you realize you can do it.
The kicker is we start out by simulating real environments in mixes, but then end up having to simulate what people expect from the medium as opposed to real life.
For example something I learned doing video audio, if someone is writing something on a train, viewers expect to hear the pen on paper. But irl, there’s not a chance it’s audible. Explosions are always distorted because microphones end up clipping due to the volume, etc.A great book on spatial simulation is The Art of Mixing by David Gibson. Older but forever relevant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a wonderful book about the blind man who was probably one of the earliest innovators in using a cane for echolocation.  "A Sense of the World" by Jason Roberts is the story of James Holman, who traveled the world in the early 19th century despite being blind, often being in a great deal of pain, and having limited mobility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed when I was younger that I can "hear" when I'm near a wall, or just generally get a sense of the size of space I'm in solely via sound, but it never occurred to me to make a "ping" to sense the resulting sound reflections!  Super interesting - I will have to try this.  Probably my prior spatial sense from hearing was based on really subtle background noise of either my own footsteps or just environmental sounds reflecting around, I guess?  I always felt like I am "hearing the room I'm in" but never quite knew how else to describe the sensation, but knowing people quite literally make a clicking noise to echolocate suddenly makes it much more clear!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160071</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has reestablished communication with Earth after 40 years by using a radio transmitter that had not been activated since 1981. This surprising connection was made possible as the spacecraft continues its journey into interstellar space, providing valuable data about the outer solar system. The successful transmission highlights the resilience of Voyager 1's technology and the importance of ongoing efforts to maintain contact with this historic mission, which has been exploring space since its launch in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the Voyager probes teach us lots about what's wrong with corporate America. Imagine devices that don't have built-in obsolescence, or licensing that expires, or that isn't built by committee where they just keep shipping requirements around from one department to another. Imagine if it weren't all proprietary and if it didn't have no public  or even complete documentation.Think of all the problems we have instead: Boeing airplanes that need to be rebooted if their computers are up for too long, an Ariane 5 blowing up because using the old thing should be "good enough", Microsoft Windows on ATMs and vending devices that literally can't not have pop-ups. It's like we've ceded control of our ability to do things to "methods" that corporations insist upon, even though they've been proven worse.Heck - if businesses had their way, would the Internet be run on Novell, with millions of Novell admins all around the world constantly needing to fuss with things just to keep it running?It's nice to see when science takes priority to everything else, and the hardware reflects that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever such an announcement is made, I keep asking myself something along the lines: "Just how much stuff did they put on board that thing, that there is always some way of using something differently or something different, to get back a working connection???" Incredible engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm reading Pale Blue Dot to my kids at night currently so this is really awesome. (The Voyager missions are described in excellent detail in ways that I never appreciated fully before.)It blows my mind that these are machines from the 8-track era. And they have fallbacks and redundancies that were completely ahead of their time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107078</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by Rudy Rucker focuses on "Chaos," a mathematical and literary exploration of chaos theory and related concepts. It includes code, visualizations, and discussions that illustrate chaotic systems, fractals, and the intersection of mathematics with artistic expression. Users can find resources for understanding chaos theory, implement simulations, and explore Rucker's unique interpretations of these complex ideas. The repository serves as both a scientific and artistic platform, encouraging collaboration and further exploration in the fields of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this as a high school student and saw a presentation on mandelbrot set around the same time.  The presenter showed this equation: z = z**2 + c and explained how complex numbers worked.  I went home and thought really hard- harder than I had, clearly figuring out some stuff I didn't know before (like mapping a small floating point interval to the "high-res" screen of my apple //e.
Eventually I got a working program and started it... and it didn't get very far before I had to go to bed.  I didn't even know at the time whether you could leave a computer on overnight- would it overheat?  But I did and woke up to... nothing.  My BASIC program hadn't gotten to any of the set yet, just the bands around it.  At that point, I decided I needed a faster computer and eventually upgraded to a 80286 DOS machine which I think was able to run FRACTINT.  FRACTINT was a clever optimization that used integer (which was all my poor 286 could do) and a number of other tricks to speed up set rendering.  It was a very useful lesson in how to optimize.That book, and several others (K&amp;R C, Hackers) helped expand my high school mind and point me in the direction of high performance computing, complex systems, and simulation.  The butterfly effect played a huge role in my understand of classical causality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This book changed my life. I was an awful mathematics student in high school, but having a very lukewarm interest in an artistic career I decided to take maths as an advanced subject so that I might pursue architecture or something. I ended up getting a U in my maths exams, which in the British grade system stands for “Unmarked”. I did so poorly that my paper wasn’t even worthy of a mark!Around the same time, I was wandering around the I saw a book cover with the weirdest, most beautiful looking graphics I’d ever seen. I still remember thinking “What the hell is that supposed to be?” as I picked it up. The copy I held had a colored picture segment as the middle pages with crisper, more mindblowing images. I borrowed the book and started reading it, trying to figure out how those images were drawn.Long story short, I ended up becoming quite competent at mathematics. Fractals (albeit statistical ones) actually ended up being an important topic in my doctoral research. I sometimes wonder what my life might have been like if I hadn’t seen those weird images - I’d certainly have become a very mediocre architect at best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gleick's "Chaos" got me sent to the principal's office in high school. I went crazy for fractals. Unfortunately all I had at home was an IBM PC XT. Mandelbrot set renderings were agonizingly slow and the CGA palette was too limiting.Around this time my co-conspirator and I realized the library had 386s that almost no one was using for catalog search. They became our fractal render farm. We'd exit the catalog program, insert a floppy with our latest renderer, kick off a deep zoom, and turn off the monitors to avoid suspicion until we could check back next period. The results were thrilling. What a difference the access to compute made.You all know the story -- eventually the librarian found us out and reported us for "hacking."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160647</guid></item><item><title>11.

I haven't seen much in this space since Lee Spector's "push" more than 20 years ago (http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html). I did see a mention of Push in the FAQ but it would be very interesting to compare this in detail. If I get it correctly Zyme programs are evolved on the bytecode level whereas Push's stack architecture is designed to be evolvable directly at the syntactic level? A head-to-head comparison / benchmark would be super interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this idea, it's thought provoking and I want to playIs there a repository of examples or experiments built with Zyme? Curious to see what has been explored so farI think it could be fun to focus on visual experiments; shader-like programs as a way to easily explore different outputs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"While I've observed bloat in Zyme, I don’t think this is driving the increase in mutation resistance and survival rate"

They are cancelling them because they are about to be revoked. A sort of, you-can't-fire-me-if-i-quit-first move.But why? Is there some sort of precedent they are seeking to avoid? Is this just them giving in the towel and looking to avoid further legal fees? Why are they cancelling instead of just letting the process play out?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In the US, the Broad Institute has also been selling licenses to use CRISPR.Including patents owned by MIT,  no?  It feels like this could use a disclosure and some additional context to understand where the incentives here are.

We've adopted its title above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this type of articles where we can reconstruct what happened so long ago just based on careful observations.Some other instances I've come across:* The K-Pg extinction event that wiped off dinosaurs had the impact it did because the asteroid happened to impact a shallow water region. This kicked up a lot of sulfur (in gypsum) that further affected global climate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Effects* Earth likely had rings ~466M years ago. We deduced this by looking at impact craters from that time period, and seeing that they all lie near the equator (accounting for continental drift): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X2...* Earth's rotation period was probably frozen at 21h, ~600M years ago, likely due to interaction between lunar and solar tides. This resonance could have been broken by ice ages (!!!). Amazing to think that global climate affects earth's rotation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#Resonant_st...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article perpetuates the widespread misconception that dinosaurs are extinct. In reality, (some) dinosaurs survived and evolved into modern birds. Everything from penguins to ostriches, hummingbirds to albatrosses and woodpeckers to eagles is a dinosaur.Science communication should do better and clear up this misunderstanding.It would be so much cooler to say that the asteroid killed the pterosaurs. Not only is it factually correct, it also opens doors to more curiosity. Why do they say pterosaurs instead of dinosaurs? Turns out they are separate clades. The pterosaurs, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs are all extinct as best as we can tell. The dinosaurs are not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160716</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses integrating machine learning (ML) capabilities into Go applications by using a Python sidecar. It explores the benefits of utilizing Python’s rich ecosystem for ML while leveraging Go's performance and concurrency features. The author outlines the architecture of a sidecar approach, where a Go application communicates with a Python service to handle ML tasks. The article provides insights into implementation details, examples of communication between the two languages, and considerations for deployment, ultimately emphasizing a practical strategy for developers looking to combine the strengths of both languages in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

This isn’t what Go was designed for and it will likely never be a good language to interface with ML.The Go to C FFI is too slow for native Cuda ops and Go doesn’t have a good bridge to Python.Rust is a much much better option in these scenarios&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last week I started this OllamaTea [1] BubbleTea component library which tries to leverage this idea of an Ollama sidecar.I've really appreciated Ollama as a simple local inferencing service.   I'll now sometimes ask Ollama something using its CLI, rather than going to a URL bar.  Once Llama 3.2 Vision became available on Ollama this month [2], I got excited to try them with visual UI elements.  I've also wanted to explore some kid-friendly TUIs, which need to be cheap and private.OllamaTea is not intended to be a full-feature Chat program, but rather as scaffolding for adding Ollama to custom TUI apps.Once I had the base OllamaTea library, I was able write the POC that inspired the whole thing.;  I made a TUI that plots a terminal chart of some market data, converts that to an image, then prompts Ollama about it.   Easy to achieve once all the pieces were in place. [3]The direct Ollama Golang API [4] is very easy to use.  OllamaTea just makes it easier to make TUIs.  While most of the research action is in Python, I think there's room for ML applications/services/orchestrators written in Golang and working with the Ollama API surface [5].[1] https://github.com/nimblemarkets/ollamatea[2] https://ollama.com/blog/llama3.2-vision[3] https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-...[4] https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ollama/ollama/api[5] https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Completely bespoke models are typically trained in Python using tools like TensorFlow, JAX or PyTorch that don't have real non-Python alternativesThe article outlines some interesting ways to evade this problem. What's the latest thinking on robustly addressing it, e.g. are there any approaches for executing inference on a tf or pytorch model from within a golang process, no sidecar required?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108933</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.Hard disagree. If you cant decompose to avoid "wonky parameters" then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.IME "heavy" function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Copy-paste is OK once. The second time you're introducing duplication (i.e., three copies), don't. You should have enough data points to create a good enough abstraction. The risk of diverging implementations of the same thing is too high at this point, and consolidation is needed.This heavily depends on how likely it is for the reasons of change to also apply to the other copies. If the reasons for why the code is the way it is are likely to evolve differently for the different copies, then it’s better to just leave them as copies.Just being the same code initially is not a sufficient reason to create an abstraction. Don’t focus on the fact that the code is currently the same, instead focus on whether a change in one copy would necessarily prompt the same change in the other copy.This also applies to pieces of code that are different from the beginning, but are likely to have to change in conjunction, because they rely on shared or mutual assumptions. If possible place those pieces of code next to each other, and maybe add a source comment about the relevant mutual assumptions.In other words, avoiding code duplication is a non-goal. Keeping code together that needs to evolve together is a goal. Instead of DRY or WET (don’t repeat yourself, write everything twice), think SPOT (single point of truth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Copy-paste is OK once. The second time you're introducing duplication (i.e., three copies), don't. You should have enough data points to create a good enough abstraction. The risk of diverging implementations of the same thing is too high at this point, and consolidation is needed. It's better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.The more I do this software engineering thing the more I feel like this “advice” bites me in the butt. Understanding when you should duplicate code versus when you should consolidate (or if you should just write a TODO saying “determine if this should be split up by [some set in stone timeline]”) is simply just a HARD problem (sometimes at least), and we should treat it as such.DRY/ WET or whatever shouldn’t be a maxim (let alone a habit! lol), it should at best be a hand-wavey 2-bit dismissal you give an annoyingly persistent junior software dev who you don’t want to actually help!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42165057</guid></item><item><title>19.

I  always had a big respect for how intuitive the Windows 95 GUI is, and reading his description of the thoughts and methods behind its inception, it's no surprise that it became so good. It seems like Microsoft was extremely pragmatic and reasonable in many of their endeavors back then. It's a wonder how it degenerated into the absolute unit of sh*t that is modern Windows (even if the filesystem and kernel is arguably a lot better, everything on top seems to be developed by an army of interns)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that little nugget of info at the end. You could originally run excel standalone without an OS and it came with windows 2.1 bundled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Raymond has been involved in the evolution of Windows for more than 30 years. He occasionally appears on the Windows Dev Docs Twitter account to tell stories which convey no useful information.Way to go Mr. Raymond!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166606</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! Looks like is used dynamic loading. Which is certainly workable. One downside is that while dynamic loading is well-supported, dynamic unloading is generally not. Meaning if you are using dynamic loading and re-loading for hot updates the server process will start to accumulate memory. Not a huge issue of the server process is periodically restarted, but can potentially cause weird bugs.You might be able to make something more robust by forking and loading the modules in a separate process. Then do something fancy with shared memory between the main process and the module processes. But I haven’t looked into this much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this :)Small, related anecdote: back in the year 2001 or so, this is in the same family of how I built websites...The difference is I wrote in in C as Apache Modules. So, like, most people were using other people's C modules (like PHP or CGI), but once you dug deeper and you wrote your logic/site _as_ a C module, it was so much more fun (and powerful too).I didn't have much of a templating language, so the answer to "can we change the text on this page?" was usually, "sure, just give me a few minutes to recompile the whole Apache server" :DFun times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This hobby project is inspired by kernel modules and AWS Lambda. It lets you write raw C modules, upload them, and have the server compile and run only the module itself at runtime—no need to recompile the entire application or restart the server.You can update routes and modules dynamically. Even WebSocket handlers can be updated without dropping existing connections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42165759</guid></item><item><title>23.

Being able to develop on the iPad is supercool (for side-project game devs). In addition, you can also now run Godot on the Meta Quest (https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/godot-game-engine/771...). Also, as Xogot runs on iPad and VisionOS can run iPad apps, it might even run there (haven't checked). That's a lot of fun platforms for playing around with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a project of Miguel de Icaza

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it very interesting that “aligning with human desires” somehow includes prevention of a human trying to bypass the safeguards to generate “objectionable” content (whatever that is). I think the “safeguards” are a bigger problem with aligning with my desires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It concerns me that these defensive techniques themselves often require even more llm inference calls.Just skimmed the GitHub repo for this one and the read me mentions four additional llm inferences for each incoming request - so now we’ve 5x’ed the (already expensive) compute required to answer a query?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So basically this just adds random characters to input prompts to break jailbreaking attempts? IMHO If you can't make a single-inference solution, you may as well just run a couple of output filters, no? That appeared to have reasonable results, and if you make such filtering more domain-specific, you'll probably make it even better. Intuition says there's no "general solution" to jailbreaking, so maybe it's a lost cause and we need to build up layers of obscurity, of which smooth-llm is just one part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160013</guid></item><item><title>25.

It's been a few years since I last used it (new client uses confluence) but I remember it was super easy to connect external tools. If your script can output text, Dokuwiki can display it :)https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwikiEDIT: I decided to try dokuwiki in Podman, works nicely as long as you run:  podman unshare chown 1000:1000 /path/to/wiki/data

https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/debug-rootless-podman-mounted...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've stuck with Git based markdown wikis. Nice thing is that when the web app you were relying on enevitably dies the data format is portable.Currently using Gitea's built in per-repo wiki as a general wiki after we migrated from Gitlab to self hosted Gitea. As a bonus there's no maintenance burden, Gitea itself has super low maintenance burden, single portable binary (I use an APT repo), single config. Latency of Navigating Gitea is also instant by comparison to Gitlab which was driving us nuts it's so slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to run Wiki.js in the past but it's really buggy and has a lot of spinners/loading pages for what is supposed to be simple html pages so i've been looking for a good self-hosted alternative since.I love how there are so many options in the HN comments, and some of them look really good as well, however I still struggle to believe that none of them are self-contained. All of them require a a redis container, a postgres container, a frontend proxy etc.. for a simple wiki? can't the wiki run it's own redis-cache internally, maybe run with sqlite? Have all the oauth/proxy stuff optional?In the meantime i've been running with mkdocs but since it's a site generator but it's not really user friendly as you need to redeploy to see changes, etc..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162751</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;New estimates indicate that human activities have already contributed to 1.5°C of long-term global warming, highlighting the urgent need for action to mitigate climate change. Researchers from Lancaster University emphasize that this rise in temperature is primarily due to greenhouse gas emissions, and they call for immediate efforts to limit further increases in global temperatures to prevent severe environmental and societal impacts. The findings reinforce the importance of international climate agreements and the necessity for substantial reductions in carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last IPCC report estimates that to limit warming to 2C, humans can only emit at most 1150 GtCO2 (at 67% likelihood) [1].There are 8.2 billion humans, so about 140tCO2/person left on average. If we assume that we get to net zero by 2050, that means the average person can emit about 5.4tCO2/person/year from today to 2050 (hitting 0tCO2/person/year in 2050). This is what emissions look like currently [2]    Top 5 countries &gt; 10m population

Which is roughly 100-200% of global yearly GDP. Or 2-5% of yearly GDP until 2050.

Not exactly PHP + jQuery but rendering HTML on the server and sprinkling some JS on top of it.Has anyone gone back to working like that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone explain what the service worker strategy accomplishes that plain old http Cache headers don't?  It saves a (almost zero weight) network roundtrip, but feels like it's re-inventing the entire wheel for that small (I think) optimization?  Am I missing something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42164154</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m scheduled to donate one of mine to a stranger in a few weeks. Similar story here—saw Scott Alexander’s story, did some research, decided it was something i had to do.I’m donating through the national kidney registry, which means that I (and five close family members) will pop to the top of the transplant list if I ever need one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I donated a kidney to my father 10 years ago. It took about 4 weeks of recovery before I could get on a plane to fly home. Even 10 years later, I have not recovered to the same energy level I had before the surgery - something about the original surgery never quite healed right, and my kidney function gets monitored every 6 months or so at the doctor's office - I take a few medications to protect my remaining kidney. My father is still alive today because of it. It is important that if you do this, that you have plans and support. It is not for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like kidney gets attention because you have two of them, but the liver is also great for donation as it regrows. After a couple months, you’ll have just as much liver as you did before the procedure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42104568</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For years I've kept a list of apps / ideas / products I may do someday. I never made the time, with Cursor AI I have already built one, and am working on another. It's enabling me to use frameworks I barely know, like React Native, Swift, etc..The first prompt (with o1) will get you 60% there, but then you have a different workflow. The prompts can get to a local minimum, where claude/gpt4/etc.. just can't do any better. At which point you need to climb back out and try a different approach.I recommend git branches to keep track of this. Keep a good working copy in main, and anytime you want to add a feature, make a branch. If you get it almost there, make another branch in case it goes sideways. The biggest issue with developing like this is that you are not a coder anymore; you are a puppet master of a very smart and sometimes totally confused brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a feat! There's at least 3 pages of google search results for the nearly same thing. The "prompt" I used in google.com is:site:github.com map comparisonI guess the difference, is that my way uses dramatically less time and resources, but requires directly acknowledging the original coders instead of relying on the plagiarism-ish capabilities of reguritating something through an LLM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Claude is fantastic. I think the model itself is good enough to be able to write good software when competently directed; it's let down only by the UI/UX around it.My only complaints are:a) that it's really easy to hit the usage limit, especially when refactoring across a half dozen files. One thing that'd theoretically be easyish to fix would be automatically updating files in the project context (perhaps with an "accept"/"reject" prompt) so that the model knows what the latest version of your code is without having to reupload it constantly.b) it oscillating between being lazy in really annoying ways (giving largeish code blocks with commented omissions partway through) and supplying the full file unnecessarily and using up your usage credits.My hope is that Jetbrains give up on their own (pretty limited) LLM and partner with Anthropic to produce a super-tight IDE native integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42164141</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have worked on Kokkos Kernels, which is performance-portable math libraries for the Kokkos programming system. We implement BLAS, sparse matrix operations, a variety of solvers, some ODE stuff, and various utilities for a variety of serial and parallel execution modes on x86, ARM, and the three major GPU vendors.The simplest and highest-impact tests are all the edge cases - if an input matrix/vector/scalar is 0/1/-1/NaN, that usually tells you a lot about what the outputs should be.It can be difficult to determine sensible numerical limit for error in the algorithms. The simplest example is a dot product - summing floats is not associative, so doing it in parallel is not bitwise the same as serial. For dot in particular it's relatively easy to come up with an error bound, but for anything more complicated it takes a particular expertise that is not always available. This has been a work in progress, and sometimes (usually) we just picked a magic tolerance out of thin air that seems to work.Solvers are tested using analytical solutions and by inverting them, e.g. if we're solving Ax = y, for x, then Ax should come out "close" to the original y (see error tolerance discussion above).One of the most surprising things to me is that the suite has identified many bugs in vendor math libraries (OpenBLAS, MKL, cuSparse, rocSparse, etc.) - a major component of what we do is wrap up these vendor libraries in a common interface so our users don't have to do any work when they switch supercomputers, so in practice we test them all pretty thoroughly as well. Maybe I can let OpenBLAS off the hook due to the wide variety of systems they support, but I expected the other vendors would do a better job since they're better-resourced.For this reason we find regression tests to be useful as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mentioning this b/c it was something that surprised me when I first heard it:Many python numerical libraries change how they internally represent certain data types and/or change internal algorithms from version to version. This means that running the exact same code on two different versions may give you slightly different results.In your side project this may not be a big deal but if you are working at, say, a hedge fund or a company that does long and complicated data processing pipelines then version upgrades with no unit testing can be "very bad".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All good stuff, I’d add though that for many numerical routines you end up testing on simple well known systems that have well defined analytic answers.So for e.g. if you’re writing solvers for ODE systems, then you tend to test it on things like simple harmonic oscillators.If you’re very lucky, some algorithms have bounded errors. For e.g. the fast multipole method for evaluating long range forces does, so you can check this for very simple systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115161</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of understanding and using Rust's borrow checker, which enforces strict rules on how memory can be accessed and modified in order to ensure safety and prevent data races. The author shares experiences and frustrations regarding the steep learning curve associated with these rules, advocating for more intuitive ways to grasp the concepts rather than rote memorization. The piece emphasizes the importance of practical examples and real-world applications to help learners navigate Rust's unique memory management features effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160501"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A theme I’m noticing more frequently as Rust gains popularity is people trying to use Rust even though it doesn’t fit their preferred way of coding.There is a learning curve for everyone when they pick up a new language: You have to learn how to structure your code in ways that work with the language, not in the ways you learned from previous languages. Some transitions are easier than others.There should come a point where the new language clicks and you don’t feel like you’re always running into unexpected issues (like the author of this article is). I might have empathized more with this article in my first months with Rust, but it didn’t resonate much with me now. If you’re still relying on writing code and waiting for the borrow checker to identify problems every time, you’re not yet at the point where everything clicks.The tougher conversation is that for some people, some languages may never fully agree with their preferred style of writing code. Rust is especially unforgiving for people who have a style that relies on writing something and seeing if it complies, rather than integrating a mental model of the language so you can work with it instead of against it.In this case, if someone reaches a point where they’re so frustrated that they have to remember the basic rules of the language, why even force yourself to use that language? There are numerous other languages that have lower mental overhead, garbage collection, relaxed type rules, and so on in ways that match different personalities better. Forcing yourself to use a language you hate isn’t a good way to be productive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have memorised the UB rules for C. Or rather, more accurately, I have memorised the subset of UB rules I need to memorise to be productive in the language and am very strict in sticking to only writing code which I know is well defined (and know my way around the C standard at a level where any obscure code I sometimes need to write can be verified to be well defined without too much hassle).
I think Rust may be difficult 
But, if I forget something, or make a mistake, I'm screwed. Yes there's ubsan, there's tests, but ubsan and tests aren't guaranteed to work when ub is involved.This is why I call C a minefield.On that note, C++ has such an explosion of UB that I don't generally believe anyone who claims to know C++ because it seems to me to be almost infeasible to both learn all the rules, or at least the subset required to be productive, and then to write/modify code without getting lost.With rust, the amount of rules I need to learn to understand rust's borrow checker is about the same or even less. And if I forget the rules, the borrow checker is there to back me up.I still think that unless you need the performance, you should use a higher level language which hides this from you. It's genuinely easier to think about.That being said, writing correct rust which is going to a: work as I intended and b: not have UB is much less mentally taxing, even when I have to reach for unsafe.If you find it more taxing than writing C or C++ it's probably either because you haven't internalised the rules of the borrow checker, or because your C or C++ are riddled with various kinds of serious issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's telling that whenever someone raises concerns about any element of Rust, no matter how constructively, they're always met with a wall of "you must not truly get the borrow checker," or "you're using Rust wrong," or "stop trying to write &lt;C/C++/Java/etc&gt; in Rust!", usually with zero evidence that that is in fact what is happening. There's never anything to improve on Rust, it's always user error / a skill issue. If there ever surfaces any audio of Linus Torvalds and Ken Thompson discussing the pros and cons of the borrow checker, I expect a sea of patronising anime avatars to show up, seeking to explain Rust's invention of the concept of ownership to them.Rust is really nifty, but there are still (many) things that could be improved in Rust, and we'd all benefit from more competition in this space, including Rust! This is not a zero sum game.Honestly, I also think many people just want a nice ML-like with a good packaging story, and just put up with the borrow checker to get friendly C-like syntax for the Option monad, sum types with exhaustive matching, etc. This is a use case that could very much benefit from a competitor with a more conventional memory model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42160501</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool! If anybody is interested in looking at the bugs that were found, they can be found on Github: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues?q=author%3AYuanchengJi...If you work with some interpreted language that is written in C or C++, it is actually quite easy to fuzz the interpreter using the scripting language natively. I outlined how to add fuzzing functions into the Pike scripting language to interact with the AFL++ fuzzer here: https://joshua.hu/aflplusplus-fuzzing-scripting-languages-na...If you have a very large codebase in such a language, you can just replace whatever function introduces some data highest on the callstack with the (new, introduced) function that retrieves fuzzing data from AFL++, and effectively fuzz all of the internal functions that your codebase uses. PHP, Perl, Ruby, or some esoteric language, are all pretty good targets for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuzzing data flow separately from control flow is an interesting ideaI can believe that it dramatically speeds up finding certain bugs, but I doubt that it can reach a large class of complex vulnerabilities, which in the case of high value targets is probably all that's left.The PHP interpreter isn't much of an interesting target, since it (usually) doesn't accept user input, even if it does power a significant part of the web.For that reason, it's much less researched and still has low complexity bugs.More robust interpreters such as JavaScript's V8 will probably fare much better against data flow only fuzzing. Bugs in V8 tend to combine both data flow and control flow[1].[1] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/in-wild-serie...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147833</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical and cultural significance of Tintagel, located in Cornwall, Wales, which is famously associated with the legend of King Arthur. It explores the archaeological findings in the area, including remnants of a castle, that suggest a rich past linking the site to the medieval legends of Arthurian lore. The piece highlights Tintagel's stunning coastal scenery, its popularity as a tourist destination, and its connections to Celtic history, making it a key point of interest for those fascinated by Arthurian myths and British heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article brought some serious ragebait for anyone with an inkling of the myth and history of that particular figure. Stating outright "He's the mythical Celtic warlord who held out against the Anglo Saxon invasion of what would come to be called England" ignores about half of the possible stories. One of the more popular threads is that he was a Roman general. Neither Saxon nor Norman, and certainly not Celtic.The stories around King Arthur are not confined in that way. Heck, Lancelot was a self-insert hero, that came during a renaissance around the myths. He came a few hundred years after the mythos was established.The historians try to point out that things are as about in-flux as possible, but the author misses it. They do end on a line reflecting the meaning, and explore some of the various aspects, but... they tend to use "is", forgetting that Arthur has been the fanfic of the world since Medieval times, over and over, and over again. You can be certain of exactly nothing when it comes to those myths.Excalibur? Not in the earliest stories. No sword in stone, no Lady in the Lake. Caliburnus and Excalibur might be the same sword, in which case Caliburn is noted in an early piece of Celtic origin, but just as a sword belonging to a warlord (Bram). Nothing much special about it. (Wikipedia's page on the sword is... Painful. Most of the focus is on the latter adaptions, of course. But the origin is not clearly Welsh. There is... Debate.)Merlin? There's a possibility that Merlin and Arthur were the same person at one point. Artr Myrrdin Gwyls is one of the earlier mythical names for the magical bard. (Where Robert Jordan pulled a lot of his inspiration for Artur Hawkwing, rather than more modern tales.)Guinevere? Didn't exist until seven hundred years after the original tales became widespread. Part of the romantic movement.Arthur fought the Saxons, right? Sometimes it's the Saxons. Sometimes the Romans. Sometimes the French. Whoever the writer felt it in-vogue to fight, pretty much.Rant over... They got close to the point, but missed it. Arthur is a story without grounding. It's supposed to be something you can take, shape, and tell a moral about your own culture. And we do. The TV shows, movies, and constant reinventions, are what the character has been for most of its existence. A tale, waiting to be told.A tale that many of us will read, and watch, and listen to, time and time again, for when the next author finds something to be inspired for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in tracing the origin of the Arthurian legends I recommend you watch this video[1] by Cambrian Chronicles.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGcuqGczjs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cynical archeologists say King Arthur did not exist but looking for him is now you get funding to find the history that did once exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162210</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the functionality and significance of the "Mark All as Read" button in digital communication platforms. It highlights how this feature enhances user experience by allowing individuals to manage their notifications efficiently, reduce overwhelm from unread messages, and maintain focus on important tasks. The author emphasizes the psychological relief it provides users by enabling them to declutter their inboxes and reflects on its broader implications for organization and productivity in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

My brain has a feature called "memory" that stops me accidentally reading any articles twice, and even better, I don't have a feeling of obligation to my rss feed reader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Every time I open my RSS feed, there’s nothing there. I can’t doom scroll through it. Because there’s nothing there. So I only open my RSS reader when I want to read somethingThat's a waste of a manual refresh action - if you only open the reader when you want to read something, there is no point in not auto-refreshing on open so you can... read something.&gt; I can mark everything as read and get back to a neutral state. And just like that, I’m done with my timeline. Isn’t that amazing?Not really, you've described a workflow with the same "FOMO" and "chore" downsides: you have to invest time into reviewing the whole batch of downloaded content otherwise if you mark everything as read you fear you've missed something important that you haven't reviewed it.
Some clients can even auto-mark links on scroll so you reduce the risk of mislabeling, but these are still not refined enough controls to tacke the issue.(and yes, of course there are ads in RSS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In gnu evolution (when it hasn't randomly decided to render the entire message window as all black), you can navigate messages with [  and ] to jump to the latest or last unread message, then depending on whether it decides to actually work in marking the message read as soon as you view it, you can press Ctrl + K to force the message to toggle its read status.In Outlook, because I have so many folders due to sieve rules, I scroll to the bottom of my account where there is an unread emails view that I scroll through and mark the ones read that need to be, then right click the whole folder and hit mark all as read.Then I just have to wait for 15 minutes as Outlook figures out how to synchronize all that!K-9 at least on the 6.x version that I remain on so I don't get dragged into Thunderbird Mobile and it's nasty new UI, the only way to set something to appear in the unified inbox is to go folder by agonizing folder and add it, not something I want to spend the time to do, so I end up scrolling through folders and looking at messages manually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162144</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "When Abstractions Break" by Jon Skeet discusses the limitations and potential pitfalls of software abstractions in programming. Skeet illustrates how abstractions can sometimes lead to misinterpretation or misuse, ultimately complicating code rather than simplifying it. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles of abstractions to avoid issues, advocating for careful design and awareness of when an abstraction may no longer serve its intended purpose. The piece serves as a reminder for developers to critically evaluate the abstractions they use and how they can impact code reliability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "world grid," which envisions new geographies of cooperation driven by interconnected networks that transcend traditional political and economic boundaries. It highlights the importance of collaboration among various stakeholders, including communities, governments, and organizations, to address global challenges like climate change and inequality. The piece emphasizes the need for innovative frameworks and practices that foster cooperative relationships and sustainable development, ultimately advocating for a shift from isolated approaches towards more integrated and collaborative models of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The global grid concept is a fascinating piece of infrastructure engineering.But the anti-market rhetoric here feels completely backwards. The article cites Shell building Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant, BP's $30B Australian investment, and major moves by other energy companies... then somehow spins this as evidence that corporate involvement is problematic?Market incentives and existing energy infrastructure expertise are exactly what's driving the current clean energy buildout at scale.I wish this was presented as the interesting systems engineering challenge it is, rather than wrapped in reflexive anti-corporate ideology. The technical aspects deserve serious analysis without the political baggage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US can not build a unified grid. Japan still suffers from the moronic 50/60 Hz split. Energy rich regions in the eastern Russia have tiny energy links with the energy hungry regions of China. And you still want to seriously claim that the world grid could be practical in this century?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dymaxion projection is my favorite map projection, and I love the idea of more resilient energy grids (and solar panels, while we're at it). But the problem here is that the dymaxion projection turns out to be terribly misleading in this context. By relying on the dymaxion projection alone it makes it seem inevitable that you'd have to have to traverse the bottleneck of the Bering Strait, but in the realm of what is both practical and achievable it makes absolutely no sense to make that the lynchpin of a global grid. Presumably the idea is that when the western hemisphere is lit it would be sending power to the eastern hemisphere (and vice versa), but, no, you're not going to be building a global backbone capable of powering half the world at a time across five thousand miles of near-uninhabited wilderness. You need infrastructure that pays for itself by connecting geographically-proximal, densely-inhabited population centers. And that might very well mean that it's more realistic to run a cable between (for example) Boston and Ireland, which is not apparent from looking at the dymaxion projection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42165517</guid></item><item><title>44.

My money says there will be no action taken until an actual security incident occurs. Administrations don’t care about the long term health of the country, only what they can do in 4 year spans.Cybersecurity is unfortunately not “sexy” enough for the common American voter to get behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My core question is, why? I understand  that security can be difficult, but why is infrastructure that is able to operate effectively for many decades before micro controllers were even a thing vulnerable to remote attacks.I get having monitoring systems for it that are accessible in a way they could be hacked and disrupted, but why is the core operational infrastructure that way? Command and control should be isolated and be using 50-70 pneumatic tech to control it. Building in such a way to allow it to be disrupted remotely is the core problem here.Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who needs cybersecurity risks when you have an incoming republican administration hellbent on gutting regulations to the benefit of industry, a SCOTUS bending over backwards to help them do it (stare decisis?

It outlines different sentence structures, including simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences, and provides examples to illustrate how each can enhance clarity and style.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the comments on this post raises a really good question.What does this hypothesis say to the German language kicking verbs to the end of the sentence?Ive heard native Germans say they like and even prefer this feature to English’s handling, saying they feel like it allows them time when speaking to pick a good verb for the sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grammar and style are ultimately just two ends of a spectrum. The greatest writing sin is ambiguity (including partial ambiguity due to the possibility of mishearing or similarity to common errors); improper placement of weight means having ambiguity until the reader completes the sentence.Weight is harmed by the widespread "rule" against using the passive voice (which is as bad a rule as "said is dead"). I'd say that topic (vs comment) is most important, then agent (vs action/patient), with subject (vs predicate/object) last and thus not sensible to make rules about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often try to break out complex ideas into multiple sentences, ordered by importance.Modifying the author’s last example: “A jug was on the table. The jug was big, red, and full of milk.”It might sound like a children’s book, but since I mostly write emails, I can expect the recipients to read the subject line, one question or request, and one sentence of context. Any more context is for the interested reader.I was taught to write that way in journalism classes (inverted pyramid), but it looks like “Bottom Line Up-Front” is a better fit for 2-way communications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130764</guid></item><item><title>47.

I wouldn't take this too seriously.Judging by the Korean score.
Korea's English proficiency is nowhere near that high. Among university age reading and listening is good. But Koreans even when they 'know' English can't string a sentence together.
(Source: live here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that Kenya is not in the list.Very high English proficiency and a large industry that does assignments for American students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42165447</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reverse engineering of the iOS 18 inactivity timer and provides insights into how it functions. It examines the technical aspects involved in analyzing and modifying the timer's behavior, aiming to enhance user understanding and customization of iOS applications. The author details the tools and methods used during the reverse engineering process, offering practical advice for developers interested in similar endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In the After First Unlock (AFU) state, user data is decryptedNote that this is a slight simplification because, I assume, the reality is irrelevant to understanding the topic:There are a few different keys [0] that can be chosen at this level of the encryption pipeline. The default one makes data available after first unlock, as described. But, as the developer, you can choose a key that, for example, makes your app's data unavailable any time the device is locked. Apple uses that one for the user's health data, and maybe other extra-sensitive stuff.[0]: https://support.apple.com/guide/security/data-protection-cla...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me the biggest takeaway is that Apple is sufficiently paranoid to add this feature. Some people (like John Gruber) advocate for activating bio lockout at the border by squeezing the volume and power buttons. I would say if you’re the type of person who would do this, you should go one step further and power off.Similarly, if you’re in a situation where you cannot guarantee your phone’s security because it’s leaving your possession, and you’re sufficiently worried, again, power off fully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to look up what SRD meant. It's a Security Research Device - "a specially fused iPhone that allows you to perform iOS security research without having to bypass its security features."https://security.apple.com/research-device/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42167633</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the simplicity and effectiveness of using a single HTML file to create simple web pages. It emphasizes that for basic web applications, a single HTML document can contain all necessary elements such as CSS and JavaScript. The author provides examples of how to construct a functional page without the complexity of multiple files, highlighting benefits such as faster load times and easier maintenance. Overall, it advocates for minimalism in web design, especially for smaller projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I strongly agree with the premise of the article - HTML could be a fabulous substrate for computational notebooks!But I didn't love the choices for how to implement it here. Dynamic, reactive HTML can be a lot more declarative than this, and Observable is cool, but strays from standard JS.I started to build a reactive HTML system called Heximal that eventually will have notebook support, but it's declarative, based on HTML templates and custom elements with a expression / reactivity system (based on the TC39 Signals proposal) on top.https://github.com/elematic/heximalIt's a bit like a mashup of HTMX, Tangle, Curvenote, and Polymer. Or like HTML if were natively reactive.I think it will lend it self to graphical editing and notebook user cases quite well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notebooks are hot these days! We also shipped our own version of a TypeScript notebook[1] but it takes quite different sides of the tradeoff: we want to run backend node code, so unlike this or observable we're not looking to run in the browser environment. Still, for many applications, this idea is a better take!Kudos to the author.https://github.com/srcbookdev/srcbook&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tend to agree with the premise of this article -- that [HTML is underutilized as a medium for disseminating scientific writing].Some recent work related to this done by Will Crichton:https://willcrichton.net/nota/

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used the same approach based on Rclone for a long time. I wondered what makes Regatta Storage different than Rclone. Here is the answer: "When performing mutating operations on the file system (including writes, renames, and directory changes), Regatta first stages this data on its high-speed caching layer to provide strong consistency to other file clients." [0].Rclone, on the contrary, has no layer that would guarantee consistency among parallel clients.[0] https://docs.regattastorage.com/details/architecture#overvie...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is honestly the coolest thing I've seen coming out of YC in years. I have a bunch of questions which are basically related to "how does it work" and please pardon me if my questions are silly or naive!1. If I had a local disk which was 10 GB, what happens when I try to contend with data in the 50 GB range (as in, more that could be cached locally?) Would I immediately see degradation, or thrashing, at the 10 GB mark?2. Does this only work in practice on AWS instances? As in, I could run it on a different cloud, but in practice we only really get fast speeds due to running everything within AWS?3. I've always had trouble with FUSE in different kinds of docker environments. And it looks like you're using both FUSE and NFS mounts. How does all of that work?4. Is the idea that I could literally run Clickhouse or Postgres with a regatta volume as the backing store?5. I have to ask - how do you think about open source here?6. Can I mount on multiple servers? What are the limits there? (ie, a lambda function.)I haven't played with the so maybe doing so would help answer questions. But I'm really excited about this! I have tried using EFS for small projects in the past but - and maybe I was holding it wrong - I could not for the life of me figure out what I needed to get faster bandwidth, probably because I didn't know how to turn the knobs correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founder of JuiceFS here, congrats to the Launch! I'm super excited to see more people doing creative things in the using-S3-as-file-system space. When we started JuiceFS back in 2017, applied YC for 2 times but no luck.We are still working hard on it, hoping that we can help people with different workloads with different tech!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174204</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines best practices for both software development and project management, emphasizing the importance of clear communication, thorough documentation, and robust testing processes. It encourages adopting agile methodologies, maintaining a clean codebase, and prioritizing user feedback to enhance the development lifecycle. Furthermore, the article highlights the need for regular code reviews and continuous integration to ensure high-quality outputs while fostering a collaborative team environment. These practices aim to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and deliver better products.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dan Morena, CTO at Upright.com, made the point that every startup was unique and therefore every startup had to find out what was best for it, while ignoring whatever was considered "best practice." I wrote what he told me here:https://respectfulleadership.substack.com/p/dan-morena-is-a-...My summary of his idea:No army has ever conquered a country. An army conquers this muddy ditch over here, that open wheat field over there and then the adjoining farm buildings. It conquers that copse of lush oak trees next to the large outcropping of granite rocks. An army seizes that grassy hill top, it digs in on the west side of this particular fast flowing river, it gains control over the 12 story gray and red brick downtown office building, fighting room to room. If you are watching from a great distance, you might think that an army has conquered a country, but if you listen to the people who are involved in the struggle, then you are aware how much "a country" is an abstraction. The real work is made up of specifics: buildings, roads, trees, ditches, rivers, bushes, rocks, fields, houses. When a person talks in abstractions, it only shows how little they know. The people who have meaningful information talk about specifics.Likewise, no one builds a startup. Instead, you build your startup, and your startup is completely unique, and possesses features that no other startup will ever have. Your success will depend on adapting to those attributes that make it unique.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took me way too long to realize this, but my experience is that "zealots, idiots, and assholes" (as the author says) are going to abuse something and wield it as a bludgeon against other people. This appears to be a fixed, immutable property of the universe.If you take it as a given that some number of people are going to get an idea lodged in their head, treat it like gospel, and beat as many other people in the head with it as they can... the best strategy you can adopt is to have the ideas in their head be at least somewhat useful.Yes, reasonable people understand that "best practices" come with all sorts of context and caveats that need to be taken into account. But you won't always be dealing with reasonable people, and if you're dealing with an asshole, zealot, or idiot, I'd sure as hell prefer one who blindly believes in, say, test-first development versus believing that "test code isn't real code, you should spend all of your time writing code that ships to users" or some other even worse nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the rejection is too strong in this article. The idea of, “best practices,” comes from an established Body of Knowledge. There is one published for software development called the SoftWare Engineering Body of Knowledge or SWEBOK; published by the IEEE.The author seems to be arguing for nuance: that these “laws,” require context and shouldn’t be applied blindly. I agree.However they shouldn’t be rejected out of hand either and people recommending them aren’t idiots.Update: one problem with “best practices,” that I think the article might have unwittingly implied is that most software developers aren’t aware of SWEBOK and are repeating maxims and aphorisms they heard from others. Software development is often powered by folklore and hand waving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42170552</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for Fast-GraphRAG offers an efficient framework for generating and processing large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks using graph data structures. It focuses on combining generative models with virtual memory access patterns to improve performance and scalability in a variety of tasks, such as knowledge retrieval and enhanced language model capabilities. The repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and documentation to facilitate implementation, making it a valuable resource for developers interested in leveraging advanced AI techniques for graph-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to someone adapting this for Obsidian and other similar tools. As a low-effort user of Obsidian I would love to reap the benefits of appropriate knowledge graphs, but don't want to put that much effort into creating one myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I've done a ton of work in this area.Few learnings I've collected:1. Lexical search with BM25 alone gives you very relevant results if you can do some work during ingestion time with an LLM.2. Embeddings work well only when the size of the query is roughly on the same order of what you're actually storing in the embedding store.3. Hypothetical answer generation from a query using an LLM, and then using that hypothetical answer to query for embeddings works really well.So combining all 3 learnings, we landed on a knowledge decomposition and extraction step very similar to yours. But we stick a metaprompter to essentially auto-generate the domain / entity types.LLMs are naively bad at identifying the correct level of granularity for the decomposed knowledge. One trick we found is to ask the LLM to output a mermaid.js mindmap to hierarchically break down the input into a tree. At the end of that output, ask the LLM to state which level is the appropriate root for a knowledge node.Then the node is used to generate questions that could be answered from the knowledge contained in this node. We then index the text of these questions and also embed them.You can directly match the user's query from these questions using purely BM25 and get good outputs. But a hybrid approach works even better, though not by that much.Not using LLMs are query time also means we can hierarchically walk down the root into deeper and deeper nodes, using the embedding similiarity as a cost function for the traversal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PageRank is one of several interesting centrality metrics that could be applied to a graph to influence RAG on structural data, another one is Triangle Centrality which counts triangles around nodes to figure out their centrality based on the concept that triangles close relationships into a strong bond, where open bonds dilute centrality by drawing weight away from the center:https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00110The paper shows high efficiency compared to other centralities like PageRank, however in some research using the GraphBLAS I and my coauthors found that TC was slower on a variety of sparse graphs than our sparse formulation of PR for graphs up to 1.8 billion edges, but that TC appears to scale better as graphs get larger and is likely more efficient in the trillion edge realm.https://fossies.org/linux/SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/Doc/The_Grap...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174829</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concerns around Google Chrome potentially becoming the "new Internet Explorer" due to issues such as performance, security vulnerabilities, and the growing dominance of the browser leading to a lack of competition. It discusses how reliance on a single browser can hinder innovation and user experience, reminiscent of the days when Internet Explorer was the dominant player. The author emphasizes the importance of diversifying browser usage and considering alternatives to ensure a healthier internet ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Perhaps the browser with the most disruptive potential is from Microsoft with Edge... With Edge, Microsoft has a chance to claim the position of the disruptive alternate browser.I believe moving from Chrome to Edge does not change a lot in terms of privacy, proprietary ecosystems, data mining practices, or other reasons that made you switch. In the end, it’s a transition from one tech giant to another of comparable scale with the same practices.Safar? I don't think Apple has the intention to dominate this sector, so it won't push Safari beyond its current geography. All that it cares about is its * walled garden.Firefox? Although I use it as my default browser, it is still far from mass adoption. The fact that they beg users to switch to Firefox* say it all: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38806270&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No not even close by every single possible measure.I was there, I suffered through it, Google would have to make TONS of hostile moves for that fact to change.I have no interest in the arguments of a closed source subscription service that wants me to switch to the bundled browser of the wealthiest company on earth's most popular consumer OS, lecturing me about using the 4th wealthiest company on earth's browser that I freely installed.The most important one from an anti-trust perspective, every device I've ever had Chrome on I've had to seek out and install/make default Chrome, that includes my mobile devices which used the manufactures browser by default.If I want to use chromium I can, Safari has been VERY late in implementing certain industry spec standards (SSE's, web sockets, IndexedDB API, animations, relative color syntax, container queries, a bunch of &lt;video&gt; stuff, flexbox, the list goes on and on.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an example of how perfidious some of the discussions on web standards are, on Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_enginesIn teeny tiny font near the bottom:"Given the market-share dominance of Blink-based browsers,[4] if Google chooses to not support a standard, like JPEG XL,[30][31] it will not become relevant on the Web.[30][31] Such standards are not listed in these tables."So if Chrome implements something that Safari doesn't, then its a deficiency in Safari. If Safari supports something Chrome doesn't, its not relevant so will not appear in any comparison tables.Chrome is 100% the new IE, as it is the being treated as the sole arbiter of what is a web standard or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42167749</guid></item><item><title>7.

“ Moreover, they (VLM) frequently deviate from a logical reasoning toward conclusions, instead of presenting a conclusion prematurely and subsequently attempting to justify it. Given that language models generate responses token-by-token, once an erroneous conclusion is introduced, the model typically continues along a flawed reasoning path.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure 2 in the paper shows what I really dislike about a lot of vision model benchmarks.I care about whether these VLMs can accurately _see_ and _describe_ things in a picture. Meanwhile the vision part of these benchmarks are a lot of extremely basic OCR that any VLMs of the past year can do. The gains in score come from the LM improving logic skills not from the actual vision ability improving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That first page graph has a very interesting choice of x-axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171043</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of traditional positional encoding methods in transformer models and suggests alternative design principles to enhance their effectiveness. The author critiques existing approaches, emphasizing the need for more intuitive and flexible encoding that could better capture positional information in a variety of contexts. By examining different interpretations and proposing a novel framework, the piece encourages innovation in the design of positional encodings, pointing towards potential improvements for state-of-the-art models in natural language processing and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to the author for clarifying something that's been a mystery to me for a few years. The positional encoding scheme in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper is only given half a page and the construction appears to come out of nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things I really love about rope is that it allows for a lot of interesting encoding schemes at inference time without model retraining. I’ve had a lot of fun playing with different relative positions. You can elicit a lot of interesting behaviors from the model when you use different rotations for keys vs queries, they don’t always have to match.For example exact position doesn’t matter too much when tokens are spaced out. Let’s say you use token position 100 for your query, you can shift all the keys around position 100, and the further they are back in the context the more freedom you have to play with the value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Furthermore, by rotating the vector, we have absolutely zero impact on the norm of the vector, which encodes the semantic information of our token.Doesn’t the angle encode semantic information? Cosine similarity works for embeddings after all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166948</guid></item><item><title>9.

The click event will always open the menu, but:&gt; - when opening with a pointer, the focus moves to the menu container.&gt; - when opening with a keyboard, there is no animation to open the menu and the focus moves to the first link in the menu.&gt; Often when opening a menu, we don't want a slightly different behaviour around focus and animations depending on if the user 'clicks' with a pointer or keyboard.&gt; The 'click' event is great when creating user experiences for keyboard users because it is device independent. On keyboards, it is only invoked by Space or Enter key presses. If we were to use the keydown event, we would have to check whether only the the Space or Enter keys were pressed.Source: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281430&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; All we had to do was change the isInvokedByMouse to check that screenX and screenY don't equal 0, rather than checking if they are greater than 0.It's obviously extremely unlikely but what if the mouse is actually at 0,0 when the user clicks? I'm not very familiar with JS, is checking for != 0 really the best/only way to do this?EDIT: actually upon going back, I realized I didn't fully process this sentence originally but it seems to address this:&gt; We should probably do further refactoring of the event handler function, since it's complicated by the fact that it also handles keydown events. For now, though, this fix will do just fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to BBC for investing in accessibility, and unfortunately discovering a nasty bug.As an industry, why haven't we figured out how to make drop downs that consistently open for all users? Is accessibility just that hard? Are there web frameworks/web components BBC should be using that already handle this?I've been wary (as a backend-focused full-stack developer) about tweaking the browsers components. There's so much nuance to how they work and the implementations are battle tested. The idea of creating a custom text box (for example) without doing extensive research of text box behavior across platforms seems ripe for failure. I notice broken copy/paste and dropped characters often enough (on major corporate sites too). Why are text boxes broken in 2024? React feels arrogant to me now.Personally, I've tried to handle this with server-side templates, CSS frameworks like Bulma, minimal JS. It's not viable for sites demanding slick custom branding (vanity?) but my text boxes work and my site doesn't cost a fortune to develop. Is it accessible to BBC standards? I'm not sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173233</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architectural choices are interesting to talk about, but I think most people reading this won't have any context to compare against, me included. How does this compare to e.g. the architecture of V8? What benefits do these choices give when compared against other engines? Etc, reading through the list it's easy to nod along, but it's hard to actually have an intuition about whether these are good choices or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great idea! I had thought about doing this with a lisp interpreter. I had identified a few key advantages:- homogenous allocation means no alignment gaps
- linear access win in garbage collection 
- indices smaller than pointers
- type discriminated index can save some sizeI haven’t verified whether those actually work out in the details. I’ll read your blog article.Don’t bother with these comments immediately comparing it to V8 (a multi billion dollar venture). I don’t know how many creative projects they’ve done before.You may be be interested in looking at Fabrice Bellard’s JS engine for ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A short comparison to how V8 does these things:1. All data in V8 is allocated into one of many heap parts: Usually new data goes into a nursery space, and if it does not get GC'd it moves to the old space. Relative position of data isn't really guaranteed at this point.2. All heap references in V8 are true pointers or, if pointer compression is used, offsets from the heap base.3. All objects in V8 include all the data needed for them to act as objects, and all of their data is stored in a single allocation (with the exception of properties, with some exceptions). The more specialised an object is, say an ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, or a DataView, the bigger it has to be as the specialisation requires more data to be stored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168166</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing, my daughter has been on pump therapy for almost eight years now and just now starting to feel like she has any control at all.I downloaded the app, just to check it out, and the one thing that just struck me right off the bat is the permissions.  Read is fine, it’s the write permissions, particularly glucose level and insulin delivery.  I don’t know the full app ecosystem, and if it would be possible for your app to interfere with the insulin delivery settings on her pump.if you have a website or anything that discusses how the application operates and what the permissions are used for it definitely check it out.Ultimately though this looks like a great tool!(Also really digging the company name!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, I'm a doctor and work in a similar area. I really like the name and well done on shipping. You can tell the app is made by a patient who suffers from the condition, which is amazing.I would be really careful in this area though, especially using ChatGPT to generate suggestions. This to me this does venture into medical device territory, based on the intended use. Check the guidelines here https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-s... - UK specific, but will be similar for FDA.Honestly, I would seek proper consultancy advice, remove any suggestions / recommendations for now, and just have it as a data-logging platform. The disclaimer unfortunately will not stand up.Congratulations on getting this far - I really hope you continue on this path, just make sure you are on firm ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious where AI added value for you here? I can see the obvious use cases like photo recognition of meals for tracking, but wondering if there's anything more unique.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168491</guid></item><item><title>12. 20 years of Google Scholar</title><link>https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-scholar-20-years/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates the 20th anniversary of Google Scholar, highlighting its impact on academic research and accessibility to scholarly literature. It discusses how Google Scholar has evolved over the years, enhancing the way researchers, students, and educators access diverse academic resources. The piece emphasizes features such as citation tracking, advanced search options, and the integration of new technologies that aid in finding relevant publications, ultimately promoting the democratization of information in academia.&lt;/p&gt;

Not in a Scopus-indexed journal, it does not count anymore than a reddit comment. This gives Elsevier tremendous power. But in CS/ML/AI most academics and students turn to Google Scholar first when doing searches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20 years and still no API. In my past as an academic I've tried several times to build systems to depend on Scholar and was always taken aback by the lack of an API. I get it was not to be swallowed whole by other publishers etc, but that has reduced the potential of the product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42175023</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The standard heuristic any 2D packing algorithm starts with is left-bottom or bottom-left (the choice is symmetrical). Place a piece as much to the left as possible, and among equal choicse as low as possible (or vice versa, as the choice was in the linked article). From this base heuristic, further meta-heuristics can be developed with choices for the order to pack parts, how to choose among "almost equal" positions, choosing among rotations and symmetries, and so on.As far as I can tell, the "Skyline algorithm" is bottom-left with the limitation that created holes can not be packed. This doesn't feel like a packing algorithm as much as it feels like a heuristic to speed up position finding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting variation is Dynamic Storage Allocation, in which the rectangles can slide only alongside one axis.AKA "static memory allocation", since the heights of the rectangles can be interpreted as buffer sizes, and their widths as lifetimes.Most of my PhD's effort has been devoted to beating the SOTA in this. Problem's importance nowadays is owed to deep learning's memory wall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a machine in a certain wood window manufacturer's plant that I have toured, which uses lasers to measure odd pieces of wood and then table saws to cut them into necessary sized pieces, minimizing waste - even cuts for fingerjoints - it all happens on a moving belt, and it happens extremely fast and in real-time. I was impressed. Probably powered by something like this algorithm (or the MAXRECTS one)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173114</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;MailCatcher is a tool designed for developers to easily test email sending in their applications. It captures any emails sent during development and displays them in a web interface, allowing users to view the email content without actually sending it to real recipients. This helps ensure that email functionality works correctly while preventing the clutter of sending test emails to actual inboxes. MailCatcher is simple to install and integrate with various programming frameworks, providing a lightweight solution for email testing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cudos for making an email-less one-click trial! Looking quite robust, but I did not understand AI feature.I selected a menu element, and tried some prompts like "make it shine" "make it see-through" "make it cool" and "make it rock", and I saw it rewriting exactly same code for menu every time, changing some of these tailwind ciphers but with no effect on actual look &amp; feel. What am I supposed to get or prompt there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good lord, man, this is a _side_ project? Most impressive. Nothing much to add except to say I am most impressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is solid, I'll show my appreciation by giving constructive criticism. This is after giving it the "120 second glance" that I imagine is how most people scan projects quickly without a proper deep dive:* First impression: this is a website builder that looks and feels like many other website builders, with some advantages like low onboarding friction, and AI integration. As a solo project reaching par is a triumph. But I think if you continue to diverge your marketing page from a default SaaS startup style you can separate yourself more from the pack AND build a reputation as a better design tool instead of another design tool. Of course the product is more important than the landing page, but perception is perception. You do for example show personality in some of the loading pages which I personally enjoy.* I got about 4 hours of sleep last night. I was thrilled when I could click into your app and immediately play around without having to register or experience other forms of friction. But complex design interfaces are overwhelming to me. How do I learn your tool quickly? Why should I invest the time to learn your tool versus other great tools? These are questions I'm left with after a quick scan. There are a lot of developer tools vying for my time. And I imagine their all working on AI integrations if they don't have it already.* As a SWE I don't like Tailwind. I don't like the syntax soup, I don't like having to memorize less conventional syntax because my brain already has enough trivia in it, and I prefer small indie projects that are maintained by extremely small teams with limited resources. As a result I do not reach for Tailwind (despite having paid the $300 or whatever for their membership!). What about developers who don't want to use Tailwind?* As a potential business customer, can I depend on you? Where will this product be in multiple years? What's the process to transition from a competing tool? What's the process for transitioning to a different tool? Enterprise customers, where the real money is, care about consistency and managing liability sometimes (often?) more then the potential value of a new tool. Consider looking into various compliance licensing, industry audits, and enterprise features, that will be needed to attract investors who want returns based on enterprise sales, not consumer sales.I wrote this up because I like your project and hope you succeed. Hopefully it helps!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173119</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Dynamics of Primal-Dual Algorithms for Optimization" presents an analysis of primal-dual algorithms used in convex optimization problems. The authors explore the convergence properties, dynamics, and performance of these algorithms, providing theoretical insights into their behavior. They introduce new techniques for improving the understanding of their algorithmic structures and establish connections between their findings and existing literature on optimization. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of primal-dual frameworks in obtaining optimal solutions while addressing practical challenges in implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have already hit upon, the problem forever lies in standardization of whatever is intended to replace TCP in the data center, or the lack thereof. You’re basically looking for a protocol supported in hardware from endpoint to endpoint, including in firewalls, switches, routers, load balancers, traffic shapers, proxies, etcetera - a very tall order indeed. Then, to add to that very expensive list of criteria, you also need the talent to support it - engineers who know it just as thoroughly as the traditional TCP/IP stack and ethernet frames, but now with the added specialty of data center tuning. Then you also need the software to support and understand it, which is up to each vendor and out of your control - unless you wrap/encapsulate it in TCP/IP anyway, in which case there goes all the nifty features you wanted in such a standard.By the time all of the proverbial planets align, all but the most niche or cutting edge customer is looking at a project the total cost of which could fund 400G endpoint bandwidth with the associated backhaul and infrastructure to support it - twice over. It’s the problem of diminishing returns against the problem of entrenchment: nobody is saying modern TCP is great for the kinds of datacenter workloads we’re building today, but the cost of solving those problems is prohibitively expensive for all but the most entrenched public cloud providers out there, and they’re not likely to “share their work” as it were. Even if they do (e.g., Google with QUIC), the broad vibe I get is that folks aren’t likely to trust those offerings as lacking in ulterior motives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why Fibre Channel isn't used as a replacement for TCP in the datacenter. It is a very robust L3 protocol. It was designed to connect block storage devices to servers while making the OS think they are directly connected. OSs do NOT tolerate dropped data when reading and writing to block devices and so Fibre Channel has a extremely robust Token Bucket algorithm. The algo prevents congestion by allowing receivers to control how much data senders can send. I have worked with a lot of VMware clusters that use FC to connect servers to storage arrays and it has ALWAYS worked perfectly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has already been done at scale with HTTP/3 (QUIC), it's just not widely distributed beyond the largest sites &amp; most popular web browsers.  gRPC for example is still on multiplexed TCP via HTTP/2, which is "good enough" for many.Though it doesn't really replace TCP, it's just that the predominant requirements have changed (as Ousterhout points out).   Bruce Davie has a series of articles on this:  https://systemsapproach.substack.com/p/quic-is-not-a-tcp-rep...Also see Ivan Pepelnjak's commentary (he disagrees with Ousterhout): https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/01/data-center-tcp-replacement...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168997</guid></item><item><title>18.

Apparently it's how the shoulder blade (scapula) connects to the coracoid bone (a bone not present in therian mammals).  From Wikipedia's article on Enantiornithes:&gt; Specifically, in the Enantiornithes, the scapula is concave and dish-shaped at this joint, and the coracoid is convex.  In modern birds, the coracoscapular joint has a concave coracoid and convex scapula.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A) incredible article, one of the few where I didn’t feel compelled to give up and find the underlying paper. Well written, beautiful diagrams, appreciably concise. Thanks for posting!B) The image of ~starlings hanging out with dinosaurs blew my mind. Talk about an odd juxtaposition! But I’m no dinosaur nerd, and haven’t seen the new generation of shows.C) I just have to nitpick this to defend my buddies:  Modern birds have some of the most advanced cognitive capabilities in the animal kingdom, comparable only with mammals.

Maybe true for vertebrates, but octopuses deserve a spot on that list!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173184</guid></item><item><title>19.

I mean, I personally think that the explicit large API surface of WinNT is kinda nicer than jamming a bunch of weird functionality into files and file descriptors like Linux, but when things work, they do show some nice advantages of unifying everything to some framework, ill-fitting as it may sometimes be (Though now that I say this, it's not like WinNT Objects are really any different here, they just offer more advanced baseline functionality like ACLs). io_uring and it's ability to tie together a lot of pre-existing things in new ways is pretty cool. UNIX never really had a story for async operations, something I will not fault an OS designed 50 years ago for. However, still not having a decent story for async operations today is harder to excuse. I've been excited to learn about io_uring. I've learned a lot listening to conference talk recordings about it. While it has its issues (like the many times it (semi-?)accidentally bypassed security subsystems...) it has some really cool and substantial benefits.I'll tell you what I would love to see next: a successor to inotify that does not involve opening one zillion file descriptors to watch a recursive subtree. I'm sure there are valid reasons why it's not easy to just make it happen, but it feels like it will be a major improvement in a lot of use cases. And in many cases, it would probably fix the dreaded problem of users needing to fight against ulimits, especially in text editors like VSCode.I don't have anything of great substance to say about the actual subject of the article. It feels a bit late to finally get this functionality proper in Linux after NT had it basically forever, but any improvement is welcome. Next time I'm doing something where I want to wait on a bunch of FDs I will have to try this approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discussion thread in the Erlang community proposing implementing io_uring for BEAM, security issues, and a digression comparing it to FreeBSD's kqueueshttps://erlangforums.com/t/erlang-io-uring-support/765/18?pa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprisingly, I only came across Francesco's blog this month. I stumbled upon the 2021 post "Speeding up atan2f by 50x" while searching for others who have to reimplement trigonometry in SIMD every other year. I've also enjoyed "Beating the L1 cache with value speculation" from the same year, as well as the 2013 Agda sorting example.Highly recommend checking it out: https://mazzo.li/archive.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135412</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Documind is an open-source document management system designed to help users store, organize, and retrieve documents efficiently. The project offers features such as document version control, collaborative editing, and advanced search capabilities. It aims to streamline workflows and enhance productivity by providing users with a centralized platform for managing their documents seamlessly. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution details for developers interested in enhancing the system’s functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the source, Documind appears to:1) Install tools like Ghostscript, GraphicsMagick, and LibreOffice with a JS script. 2) Convert document pages to Base64 PNGs and send them to OpenAI for data extraction. 3) Use Supabase for unclear reasons.Some issues with this approach:* OpenAI may retain and use your data for training, raising privacy concerns [1].* Dependencies should be managed with Docker or package managers like Nix or Pixi, which are more robust. Example: a tool like Parsr [2] provides a Dockerized pdf-to-json solution, complete with OCR support and an HTTP api.* GPT-4 vision seems like a costly, error-prone, and unreliable solution, not really suited for extracting data from sensitive docs like invoices, without review.* Traditional methods (PDF parsers with OCR support) are cheaper, more reliable, and avoid retention risks for this particular use case. Although these tools do require some plumbing... probably LLMs can really help with that!While there are plenty of tools for structured data extraction, I think there’s still room for a streamlined, all-in-one solution. This gap likely explains the abundance of closed-source commercial options tackling this very challenge.---1: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#how-we-use-your-data2: https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP, you've been accused of literally ripping off somebody's more popular repository and posing it as your own.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42178413You may wanna get ahead of this because the evidence is fairly damning. Failing to even give credit to the original project is a pretty gross move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multimodal LLM are not the way to do this for a business workflow yet.In my experience your much better of starting with a Azure Doc Intelligence or AWS Textract to first get the structure of the document (PDF). These tools are incredibly robust and do a great job with most of the common cases you can throw at it. From there you can use an LLM to interrogate and structure the data to your hearts delight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171311</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to say goodbye to a long-standing chapter in their life, reflecting on personal growth and changes experienced over time. It emphasizes the importance of embracing new beginnings and the emotional journey involved in letting go of the past. Through sharing personal anecdotes and insights, the author encourages readers to view endings as opportunities for new adventures and self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks, Ondsel - it was a worthy and welcome attempt. And you left FreeCAD much better off than when you found it. For that reason, Ondsel may be shutting down, but it is anything but a failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I have a personal project and want to make a simple CAD drawing of a building or a simple model, as I would using AutoCAD at work, I go through the same song and dance. I look around at the options online, my jaw hangs open at the cost of any commercial CAD subscription/licence, then I get frustrated by a glaring lack of functionality or useability while trying some free/open source solution, and resort to a 30 day trial or MSPaint/paper.Some of the comments already mention how blender's existence is predicated upon it filling a niche in certain senses, instead of trying to achieve feature parity with an entrenched giant. That makes sense, and it's unfortunate, as this space could use an open source option with Blender's polish. In my own industry, mining, I am certain some commercial interests would happily make their product an extension/plugin for a polished FreeCAD (or other), were it at that point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Truly bummed about this one.I’d been learning CAD with Ondsel, and have printed off half-a-dozen of my models to help around the house.If this comment finds its way to the team, I just want to say thanks.The topo naming fix and the assembly workbench were enormous contributions to the community that will be with us always.But I really believed in Ondsel’s vision for an online repo for 3d models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42169998</guid></item><item><title>22.

They don't submit because there's no reason to, and some want to keep the size of their clusters a secret. They're all running Nvidia. (Except Google, who uses TPUs and Nvidia.)&gt; El Capitan – we don’t yet know how big of a portion yet as we write this – with 43,808 of AMD’s “Antares-A” Instinct MI300A devicesBy comparison XAI announced that they have 100k H100s. MI300A and H100s have roughly similar performance. Meta says they're training on more than 100k H100s for Llama-4, and have the equivalent of 600k H100s worth of compute. (Note that compute and networking can be orthogonal).Also, Nvidia B200s are rolling out now. They offer 2-3x the performance of H100s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After skimming the article, I'm confused -- where exactly is the headline being pulled from?If you look at the table toward the bottom, no matter how you slice it, Nvidia has 50% of the total cores, 50% of the total flops, and 90% of the total systems among the Top 500, while AMD has 26% of the total cores, 27.5% of the total flops, and 7% of the total systems.Is it a matter of newly-added compute?&gt; This time around, on the November 2024 Top500 rankings, AMD is the big winner in terms of adding capacity to the HPC base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure there is also a lot not on the Top500.

&lt;p&gt;The Museum of Bad Art is dedicated to showcasing and celebrating art that is considered undesirable or poorly executed. It aims to highlight the value of unintentional humor and the quirks of creativity, providing a platform for works that provoke thought and laughter rather than traditional aesthetic appreciation. The museum features a collection of pieces that are often amusing or bizarre, alongside descriptions that enhance the experience of viewing the artwork. Through its playful approach, the Museum of Bad Art encourages visitors to rethink their perceptions of art and what constitutes "bad" or "good" art.&lt;/p&gt;

Ostensibly this is taking on art museum snobbery, but many of these works are by amateurs and were literally pulled out the trash.  It feels like an embittered teacher making fun of a kid, while the class snickers at the spectacle of public humiliation.To each of the artists: congratulations for having the courage to trust in your imagination.  I hope that others have engaged with your works with greater generosity.EDIT: There’s a missed opportunity here for a critic to participate in the exhibition by praising the works sincerely.  (If museum goers can detect sarcasm then the critique has failed.) That would be more fun and it wouldn’t even be hard since the works have already set expectations low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to the bad art museum in iceland and it was quite something to see in person. As you turn each corner, new dimensions of weird and shock emerge. Some was just kind of silly, and some was accidentally horrifying in an uncanny valley sort of way. Some were mental illness on display. I left with some very mixed feelings.. the ha-ha with the oh-no, and the oh-my! Definitely glad to have seen it. Online photos do not do the awfulness justice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This philosophy matches up with how I curate my music collection, which has brought me a great deal of joy even if it means no one will give me the aux cable at parties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168503</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of the CSS `contain` property, which is used to limit the scope of the effects of styles and layout of an element, enhancing performance by reducing the amount of layout recalculation needed by the browser. It explains the different values that can be assigned to the property, such as `content`, `layout`, `style`, and `paint`, detailing their specific functions and implications. Additionally, the article includes examples and use cases, browser compatibility information, and links to related topics for further exploration, making it a comprehensive resource for developers looking to optimize their web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Filion, a notorious figure in the world of online harassment, has pleaded guilty to federal charges related to swatting—a tactic where false reports are made to prompt police responses to someone's location, often endangering lives. Filion's actions, which included orchestrating hoaxes that targeted various individuals, highlight the severe consequences of swatting, both legal and personal. His plea is part of a broader effort by authorities to combat such dangerous pranks that have garnered national attention due to their potential for violence and chaos. The article discusses the implications of his plea and the ongoing challenges law enforcement faces in addressing swatting incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between this and libcamera? From the page:There are already other libraries for camera support on Linux. You can use the V4L2 APIs directly, or use libcamera, or libmegapixels.They all strike various middle points on the power vs user-friendliness scale. Having worked with all of them while developing camera support for the Librem 5, I never got the impression that any of them are particularly easy to use.Libobscura is an experiment because it tries to find an API that fulfills the needs of most people and remains hard to use wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks cool. I'm looking forward to seeing the progress on the GPU acceleration.I'm a maintainer for openpnp-capture and I've always had the thought of hardware acceleration in the back of my mind, but I didn't really know how I would go about it. Reading the comments on using shaders for color space conversion really opened my eyes.I like that this is in Rust. It should make it very portable over time and Rust's dependency management and builds should make it a heck of a lot easier to distribute on multiple architectures (if you intend to).Looks awesome, good luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146936</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Bhutan's emigration crisis, highlighting the challenges faced by the small Himalayan nation as many of its citizens seek opportunities abroad. It examines the cultural and economic factors driving this trend, including limited job prospects and the allure of better living conditions in other countries. The piece features personal stories of individuals who have left Bhutan, the impact on the country's demographic landscape, and the government's response to emigration. Overall, it sheds light on the tension between national identity and the pursuit of prosperity in a globalized world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the headline CBS gave the article, it seems the problem is not with happiness, but with the seductive appeal of materialism and the effects of exposing one culture to another.Social comparison theory is the idea that our satisfaction with what we have isn't an objective measure, but is actually based on what we see other people have. Young people generally seem to have an innate desire to leave their hometowns and seek out what else might be waiting out there for them. When you add in globalization and media influence exposing them to what looks like a "better" life with more things, it's not surprising that they've seen ~9% of young people leave Bhutan.The other question is, what will happen if Bhutan does increase their financial wealth as well as their happiness? Will they then see a net influx of people through immigration, looking for the lifestyle Bhutan promises? And will those new people be able to maintain the culture Bhutan has cultivated?It sounds like the concept of Gross National Happiness is a successful one, on its own, but it brings new challenges that couldn't have been forseen originally. That doesn't mean they can't solve them without giving up their core values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bhutan's economy is growing, but it still has a nominal GDP per capita of only $3,700. Their youth unemployment rate is 16%, but 24% in urban areas. For all the talk of gross national happiness, it's hard to imagine a young person feeling happy in a poor country with very limited opportunities for upward mobility.I'm also not sure that mass emigration should be seen as an existential threat. Many developing economies have very successfully leveraged emigration and remittances as an engine of economic growth. If Bhutan can modernise into a more open economy, those young people could start returning home with the skills, experience and capital to do great things.https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?location...https://www.nsb.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/1...https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/03/11/a-stron...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I were tasked with improving Bhutan, one of the things I would focus on is probably lead. 3/4 of Bhutanese children have elevated levels of lead in their blood.https://www.unicef.org/bhutan/press-releases/national-blood-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42172281</guid></item><item><title>29.

It's a horrendous UX, especially when using different devices and browsers. I imagine others just give up instead of dealing with the crap. They shouldn't use the word accessibility when their whole service is the exact opposite.The bots can probably solve them easier than blind people anyway, or they can outsource them to third world workers for next to nothing.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses resignation agencies in Japan, a unique service that assists employees in resigning from their jobs. These agencies help individuals navigate the often complex and stressful process of quitting, which can involve negotiating with employers and managing the emotional aspects of leaving a job. Resignation agencies offer support by crafting resignation letters, preparing for exit interviews, and providing counseling to ensure a smooth transition. The piece highlights the growing trend of these services as a response to Japan's rigorous work culture and the challenges faced by employees in managing their resignations.&lt;/p&gt;

Internet surveys tend to be less accurate and I don't know the methodology they've used to select the 800 or so participants.But companies bullying employees on resignation seems to be a bigger issue than I thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone in Japan share what ground truth looks like around this? Does this churn matter to businesses when they’re in a labor supply shortage? Do these folks have other jobs they’re moving to? Or are they potentially NEETs bailing on being employed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42169027</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SMHasher/Murmurhash author here - I don't see anything fundamentally wrong with this hash function, it uses basically the same operations as the Murmur family (and a lot of other hashes at this point).The handling of the "tail" of the key (the last &lt; 32 bytes) is slightly odd (the "if (l &amp; 1) { mix 1 byte of key }" happens before 8-byte chunks and 2-byte chunks), but if it passes SMHasher it should be fine for general use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might also try running it through Smhasher3: https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/REA...Also here is a hash function I wrote a while ago now: https://github.com/Keith-Cancel/k-hashv/tree/main&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the benefit of processing chunks of 8 bytes is obvious, what's the purpose of grouping those into macrogroups of 4? Does it  trigger any implicit parallelism I failed to spot? Or is it just to end this phase with the 4 h[] having had the same amount of entropy, and thus starting the next one with h[0]?&gt; The way it loads the 8 bytes is also important. The correct way is to load via shift+or
&gt; This is free of any UB, works on any alignment and on any machine regardless of it's endianness. It's also fast, gcc and clang recognize this pattern and optimize it into a single mov instruction on x86 targets.Is a single MOV instruction still fast when the 8 bytes begin on an odd address?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168576</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of "black companies" in Japan, which refers to businesses that exploit workers through harsh working conditions, excessive overtime, and low wages. It highlights how these companies often engage in illegal practices, such as unpaid labor and harassment, creating a toxic work environment. The article explores the cultural factors contributing to the persistence of black companies in Japan, including societal pressure and the stigma around job changes. Additionally, it addresses the impacts on employees' mental and physical health, and the growing awareness and resistance against such practices in modern Japanese society.&lt;/p&gt;

If I say I'm going to quit, I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting."Interestingly, this is actually possible under Japanese law/legal precedent. If an employee, for example, decides to put in notice and then half-ass their job until their departure date, a company could actually sue the employee and win.Other Japan-labor-law fun fact: if you are a contract worker, it is literally illegal for you to quit prior to your contract expiry date. Hope you like that job you signed onto!Obligatory disclaimer: IANAL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still remember the day of the explosion down the road from our office in Nagoya. The worker had been driven to such desperation and rage that he sealed himself off in the boss's office after dousing everything (including himself) in gasoline.The cops were there, trying to talk him down, but the fumes had reached such a concentration that the next time the aircon kicked in, the place exploded.The worker exploitation in Japan is BAD, and has been for decades. When you employ someone, you don't technically own them, but culturally you absolutely do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny seeing a post about these as that's what I was recently reminded of when reading this post:https://x.com/DOGE/status/1857076831104434289("80+ hours per week" ... what kind of a psycho even writes this down and puts it out there as if it was normal in any way...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42169615</guid></item><item><title>34.

Any inferences to the contrary are simply not true,” AHF said.There's a bit of a he-said/she-said thing going on here. It seems like it would be pretty easy to verify samples whether the wood came from a plantation or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I just built a house, and if there were some definitive test to know the wood came from somewhere illegally, who would I sue?In the US, you would sue the person you paid (who would then sue the middleman company who sold them the wood, and so on down the chain until the chain eventually ends).It’s interesting to think what a market would look like if we removed indemnity and limitation of liability from contracts (which allows liability to easily be passed down to vendors) in certain cases. I think that’s how it works in certain other countries.E.g. what if the liability was solely with the person who sold me the wood (even if they’re actually “innocent” and simply bought from a fraudulent distributor).I can easily see how it would help to keep all liability at the closest link to the consumer in the chain, but then again how realistic is it that any home builder is going to (reasonably) be able to do enough vetting of distributors and suppliers to know exactly how and where everything was made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could see importing some exotic hardwood from Cambodia (if they have any), but why is is cost effective to make shitty plywood with anything other than cheap locally sourced timber ?!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174703</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses phonetic matching, a technique used in computer science and linguistics to compare and match words based on their pronunciation rather than their spelling. It explains the importance of phonetic matching in applications like search engines, data deduplication, and natural language processing. The author highlights popular algorithms, such as Soundex and Double Metaphone, detailing how they work and their advantages and limitations. Additionally, the article illustrates practical use cases, recommending best practices for implementing phonetic matching to improve data retrieval and accuracy in various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea that "shore" and "sure" are pronounced "almost identically" would depend pretty heavily on your accent. The vowel is pretty different to me.Also, the matches for "sorI" and "sorY" would seem to me to misinterpret the words as having a vowel at the end, rather than a silent vowel. If you're using data meant for foreign surnames, the rules of which may differ from English and which might have silent vowels be very rare depending on the original language, of course you may mispronounce English words like this, saying both shore and sure as "sore-ee".I'm sure there are much better ways to transcribe orthography to phonetics, probably people have published libraries that do it. From some googling, it seems like some people call this type of library a phonemic transcriber or IPA transcriber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I created this sheet[0] to tech my kid to learn Tamil using Roman letters and in the process figured it could be useful for kids learning other Indian languages as well.With the history of reading and speaking (Indian) phonetic languages, I think, English would've been much nicer and uniform if the vowels sounded right, esp the long forms.Extending the long forms using orthogonal vowels probably made it complex, especially with the lack of ii and uu.Say for instance, to extend the long form of "o", "a" was used. Eg: boat, goat. The correct spelling could've been boot, with the original boot spelled as buut.With that notion, door is probably the only word that's written and pronounced phonetically correct, with two oo.Curious to know how would such correct phonetic translation aid in the encoding, matching and compression.[0] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hdVh-oBUngTyigqDdjg...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, hello, I didn't realize this was shared here! I guess let me know if anyone has any questions. I mostly wrote this piece as part of processing some hard feelings I've been having and seeing shared among Jewish folks around me, but I also ended up learning quite a bit about phonetic encoding algorithms, and I've spent several years at this point steeped in forced alignment via Storyteller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42169363</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a solar-powered desalination system that effectively produces freshwater without the need for additional batteries. The system utilizes solar energy to drive the water purification process, offering a sustainable solution to address global water scarcity. This innovative technology leverages advancements in material science to enhance the efficiency of solar energy utilization, making it a promising method for providing clean water in regions with limited access. The design aims to be cost-effective and environmentally friendly, paving the way for widespread adoption in a variety of settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a questionable way to present what's an excellent project and hopefully soon to be commercialized technology.  The big deal here is it's a presumably installation ready application of EDR for desalination instead of RO which most systems use.  This is a big deal because the membranes use electricity instead of pressure as the filter, which means everything can run at low, normal plumbing, pressures instead of the crazy high pressure RO stuff.  For seawater it's borderline whether or not it will match RO for performance, but for lower salinity groundwater and industrial wastewater, it should be significantly higher performance for the same power as well as lower maintenance and capex.The no batteries thing is basically irrelevant to the innovation, and in fact Genius Water already offers no battery RO systems, also with questionable benefit (as well as being difficult to work with).I run a solar and water focused EPC in East Africa and will hopefully be working with these guys in the future when they're off the ground with a commercial system.  The potential is extremely high, particularly if the maintenance overhead and operational complexity can come down in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlke some comments are implying, this is not a solar distiller with "additional steps". It still uses far less energy than distillation as it doesn't involve phase changes.It uses Electrodialysis, which is a mass separation process in which electrically charged membranes and an electrical potential difference are used to separate ionic species from an aqueous solution and other uncharged components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what this means for the calculations outlined here: https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/how-much-energy-do...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42167763</guid></item><item><title>45.

For rapidly depreciating assets.Here I am working out TCO costs for a range of mid-sized cars for my next purchase, and trying to decide if the extra $2k for a Prius Prime over a Prius will beat the differential in fuel costs for my driving situation. I feel like a chump, but I know it's the smarter thing to do with my money.I coworker of mine just spent $100k on a regular old pickup truck that is planned to spend less than 5% of the time doing anything other than commuting him back and forth to work. It doesn't fit in any of the parking garages around here, or in his garage -- he has to park it at the other side of a surface lot because it doesn't fit in the normal spots. It gets like 11 mpg and uses the 92 octane fuel.Americans won't buy cheap cars, they won't buy upmarket small cars, but they'll burn their children's college fund into the ground for a 2 second gain on 0-60 and bad ergonomics.I can afford the fancy car, but I'd rather turn $100k into $200k in my index funds and buy an entire apartment in Spain overlooking the Mediterranean with the gains.We can have nice things, but this is why we can't have affordable things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took advantage of the IRA solar power and $7500 EV credit, now I have an off grid home all electric appliances and excess power for hot tubs and EV's. The Ford Lightning acts as a generator. 
This was the greatest most life changing and impactful legistlation ever:  I've had $0 (ZERO!) in gasoline, LP, and electric utility bills since installation last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/9oIT4I wish it would have adjusted for inflation. One quote: "The average transaction price for a new vehicle sold in the U.S. last month was $48,623, according to Kelley Blue Book, roughly $10,000 higher than in 2019, before the pandemic." However, about 9200 euros of that is due to inflation according to this calculator: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/That's a nitpick though. All in all, an interesting article, which can be summarized as: the EV car market is lacking demand, and car makers definitely don't want to make cheap EVs since it's already so hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42168423</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;Dumbo is a simple and efficient Python library designed to facilitate the process of creating, running, and managing distributed MapReduce jobs on cloud infrastructure. It provides an intuitive interface that abstracts the complexities of setting up and maintaining a MapReduce environment, allowing users to focus on data processing tasks. The library supports various cloud platforms, features automatic resource provisioning, and can integrate with existing Hadoop installations. Overall, Dumbo aims to simplify the execution of large-scale data processing jobs for developers and data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're requiring PHP 8.3 but not using some of the most powerful tools in 7+: strict types.```
    /* @var array&lt;string, mixed&gt; Variables stored in the context */
    private $variables = [];
```This should be typed as `array` (heck, I'd argue ArrayObject instead) and all your classes should have `declare(strict_types=1);` at the top.Your `Dumbo\Helpers` classes are basically static mine traps that you are unable to mock in unit tests. Why does `BasicAuth` expose a single static method but then calls a bunch of other static methods? What ends up happening in any class that uses any of your `Dumbo\Helpers` classes will always run whatever code is defined in these helper classes.I'm unsure where the bootstrapping process begins. What file does your webserver need to call to handle a new request? I am hoping it is within a root-level directory and not at the root level itself. In other words, `/public/index.php` vs `/index.php`. Your quickstart in README.MD makes it pretty clear that you expect the latter, which is highly unsafe. See any number of poorly configured webservers that stop processing PHP for any reason but now show your site's full contents to anyone passing by.I would strongly argue against _any_ magic in your framework. Specifically, routes: they should be explicitly defined. I still work with a legacy Symfony 1 framework project and I can't tell you how much I detest magic routing. For a modern example see how Symfony 2+ requires explicit route definition. Heck, how it requires explicit everything because magic should be left to magicians.Your framework seems like it can only handle `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requests, but not `multipart/form-data`.Take these as positive criticisms of your work. It's "fine". I wouldn't use it, I would actively recommend against using it, but I would actively recommend against using anything that's not Symfony (or Laravel if I were drunk). I do not think your project is at the "Show HN" level - it is still far too under-developed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting project—love the idea of learning by building! A few questions for clarity and discussion:1) Target Audience: Since Dumbo isn't aiming to compete with Laravel or Slim, who do you see as the ideal user for this framework? Hobbyists, small-scale production apps, or perhaps developers exploring modern PHP paradigms?2) Distinguishing Features: You mentioned drawing inspiration from Hono.dev—how does Dumbo bring Hono's strengths into the PHP world? Are there specific design patterns or DX (developer experience) improvements that set it apart from existing lightweight frameworks like Slim?3) Learning Resource Vision: As you see Dumbo also as a learning tool, do you plan to include guided examples or documentation for PHP developers looking to understand the modern ecosystem better?PHP is definitely in an interesting place right now; excited to see what Dumbo evolves into!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see myself ever using anything other than Laravel, but love these kinds of projects just to see what new ideas they might spark for the wider PHP community.

Then as others have mentioned, pin your node versions. If you're afraid of this happening again, npm pack is your friend.In the end, op could have done a bit more. BUT I'll give it to him that when bindings are involved, these things take more time than they should&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; time to run it after not touching it for 4 years&gt; Two hours of my life gone...Two hours of work after 4 years sounds ... perfectly acceptable?And it would have run perfectly right away if the node version was specified, so a good learning, tooThis feels like making a mountain out of a mole hill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The worst part isn't just that it's nearly impossible to run/update an outdated JS project, but that this process will repeat itself ad infinitum.On the flip side, anything that uses vanilla JS without a build will most likely run just fine, probably till the end of human civilization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42175316</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;A phased array is an advanced type of antenna system composed of multiple individual antennas, or elements, that work together to direct radio waves in specific directions without moving the physical structure. By adjusting the relative phases of the signals from each antenna element, the array can steer the beam electronically to enhance signal strength and reduce interference. Phased arrays are widely utilized in various applications including radar, telecommunications, and satellite broadcasting, thanks to their ability to rapidly change beam direction and focus on multiple targets simultaneously. The technology has evolved significantly, enabling applications such as 5G networks and modern military systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starlink doesn't get enough credit for their phased arrays terminals, I think. They've managed to make a performant antenna for 10 to 100 time less cost than the competition. Without that, the whole system wouldn't be such a success. This article goes into some details. It's the first truly mass produced RF phased array, and the fact that they've shown it's possible will have some big impacts on certain fields (SATCOM obviously, mobile networks, etc).https://lilibots.blogspot.com/2021/01/why-is-starlink-termin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A phased array radar for light planes was developed privately in 1973, but suppressed with a secrecy order. The USAF didn't have aircraft-sized phased array radars yet. [1][1] https://books.google.com/books?id=NWzlTqj0gQ4C&amp;pg=PA64#v=one...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The same principle is used with loudspeakers to create beamforming arrays, albeit at sonic frequencies.Beamforming speakers in acoustic applications are quite useful and often found in protected monuments or churches since it allows you to "aim" the acoustic energy mainly at the audience and to a lesser degree onto reverberating surfaces which you may not be willing (or allowed) to change by adding acoustic treatment. Nowadays these arrays are also often used at bigger (e.g. outdoor) stages to avoid shooting into the (complaining) neighbourhood.An interesting side note is also that the principle also works in reverse for the receiving side, so you can have array microphones that can steer the beam of their "focus", either as a column or as a 2D-array that is ceiling mount (like the Sennheiser TCC2). All these arrays show there limits as frequencies go lower tho, so that is something to check for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42162390</guid></item><item><title>50.

Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You'll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.This isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn't ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.[1]: https://x.com/lcasdev/status/1810696257137959018&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm totally fine with this, but I wish they would do the same thing with Apple. Google's platform, at the very least is open and I can run my own apps.One could ask, "How is Apple a Monopoly, and do they abuse that position?". In my view it is, since you can't have a business or build connected hardware without an iOS app. And as for abusing that position for gaining market share, there are just too many examples starting with say, watches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177767</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I'm the first author of the manuscript, so I thought I could answer some of the questions and clarify some issues (all details are in the manuscript, but who has the time to read it ;)Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery's (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.Many authors and wasted public funding: We did the experiment in our free time and we had no funding for the study = no money was wasted. Also, I don't understand why are so many people angry that students who contributed their free time and spent the whole day flipping coins with us were rewarded with co-authorship. The experiment would be impossible to do without them.Improper tosses: Not everyone flips coin perfectly and some people are much worse at flipping than others. We instructed everyone to flip the coin as if they were to settle a bet and that the coin has to flip at least once (at least one flip would create bias for the opposite side). We find that for most people, the bias decreased over time which suggests that people might get better at flipping by practice = decrease the bias and it also discredits the theory that they learned how to be biased on purpose. From my own experience - I flipped coins more than 20,000 times and I have no clue how to bias it. Also, we did a couple of sensitivity analyses excluding outliers - the effect decreased a bit but we still found plentiful evidence for DHM.If you doubt my stats background, you are more than welcome to re-analyze the data on your own. They are available on OSF: https://osf.io/mhvp7/ (including cleaning scripts etc).Frantisek Bartos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper looks like it has a large sample size, but it actually has a sample size of only 48 testers/flippers. Some of the videos of those testers show very low, low-rpm coin tosses, we're talking only 1-2 flips. Where they also flipped thousands of times, presumably in the same way. So there is actually a very small sample size in the study (N = 48), where testers that don't flip properly (low rpm, low height, few coin rotations) can affect the results disproportionately.Doesn't look like the study author backgrounds are particularly focused on statistics. I would presume with 48 authors (all but 3 of which flipped coins for the study), the role of some might have been more test subject than author. And isn't being the subject in your own study going to introduce some bias? Surely if you're trying to prove to yourself that the coins land on one side or another given some factor, you will learn the technique to do it, especially if you are doing a low-rpm, low flip. Based on the study results, some of the flippers appear to have learned this quite well.If the flippers (authors) had been convinced of the opposite (fair coins tend to land on the opposite side from which they started) and done the same study, I bet they could have collected data and written a paper with the results proving that outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a nice presentation of the paper here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QjgvbvFoQAIn essence the effect comes from "precession" - the tendency of the flip to not be purely vertical but to have some wobble/angular momentum which causes it to flip in such a way as to spend longer on one side than the other.  Depending on the technique this will have a greater or lesser effect on the fairness of the coin toss, ranging from about p_same = 0.508 for the best technique to one person in the study actually exhibiting 0.6 over a large sample which is staggeringly unlikely if the toss was purely fair. In the extreme, it shows in the video a magician doing a trick toss using precession that looks as if it's flipping but does not in fact change sides at all, purely rotating in the plane of the coin and wobbling a bit.The video is quite a nice one for setting out how hypothesis testing works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42181345</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation and use of Vector Tiles (MVT) in OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, highlighting their advantages for rendering interactive maps and enhancing performance. It explains how vector tiles allow for greater flexibility and responsiveness in map applications compared to traditional raster tiles, as they deliver map features as vector data that can be styled on the client side. The article also covers the technical aspects of working with vector tiles, such as creating, serving, and visualizing them, alongside practical tips for developers interested in integrating MVT into their mapping projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit conflicted with vector tiles. I haven't found a good combination of style and tile generator (schema) that provides the same level of detail as the original raster tiles provide.The article has screenshots that very much demonstrate this difference. The first screenshot has, for example, a lot of POIs (statues, shops, theaters, viewpoints), highways that are different when they are bridges, different colors for grass vs parks, different line widths for different highways, sports fields, building and neighbourhood names, arrows denoting one-way streets, building parts, stairs, trees, and a lot more.The second screenshot has none of that, aside from a single trolly station and a single street name (which is also rendered incorrectly).I've tried a lot of vector styles (all openmaptiles styles, the base protomaps styles, all mapbox styles) and generators (protomaps, openmaptiles, mapbox). None of them come close to the amount of detail as the raster OSM tiles while still being as readable.I've never found anyone as bothered with this as I am. Vector styles are cool as they zoom and pan very smoothly, and their style is fairly easily editable. But, for any map where you actually want to see map data instead of using it as a base map for your own data, vector maps fall short.Maybe it is just because of computational limits. I can imagine that displaying the same amount of detail as the OSM raster tiles would require too many resources: both on the client side and for tile generation.It would be nice if OpenStreetMap would try to mimic their raster style closer, instead of providing just another low contrast, low detail base map. I hope this release of open vector tiles will facilitate more detailed vector maps!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's been fascinating to watch the open source community build out vector map tile capabilities. I was doing some web GIS work back in roughly 2018, and Google/Apple's streaming vector maps performed like magic and something we would have loved to use if we could afford it. Shortly thereafter the core tech was available in open source, and then there were even free hosted solutions. Now our leaflet maps have great vector layers for free. Thanks open source!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other issue is that the arabic font is not rendering correctly in the vector version. It's rendering left to right (instead of right to left) with characters broken up instead of linked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182519</guid></item><item><title>4.

It only seeks $16,000 of which they've currently raised $249,000 based in no small part that they've already shipped several successful releases, I'd guessTheir project is open source[4], GPLv3 for the on-device software and CC-BY-SA 4 for the cad files1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=127055462: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5bZfNOZi-A3: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maslow4/maslow41-access...4: https://www.maslowcnc.com/source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like it provides an amazing amount of capability for the price, if it meets your needs. ($525 kit + $125 motor, saved you some clicking).For comparison I have an Avid 48x96 bed type CNC router that I am into for close to $10k.  Obviously the more expensive machine has more cutting capability, but I am curious what the actual accuracy of this machine is.I am getting +/- 0.010” or so for large parts, cutting .032” thick aluminum 6061-T3.  Probably doing better than that on wood due to lower cutting forces and less machine deflection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I backed the original Maslow and also the Maslow 4, and recently a 4.1 upgrade.  The creator is a really dedicated guy and the Maslow is a great CNC for those who cut sheets goods from wood (though folks have adapted it to other materials) and are OK with some tinkering.There is a decent sized community that supports the software as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42179467</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello! We are Dr. Roman Berens, Prof. Alex Lupsasca, and Trevor Gravely (PhD Candidate) and we are physicists working at Vanderbilt University. We are excited to share Black Hole Vision: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/black-hole-vision/id6737292448.Black Hole Vision simulates the gravitational lensing effects of a black hole and applies these effects to the video feeds from an iPhone's cameras. The application implements the lensing equations derived from general relativity (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12881 if you are interested in the details) to create a physically accurate effect.The app can either put a black hole in front of the main camera to show your environment as lensed by a black hole, or it can be used in "selfie" mode with the black hole in front of the front-facing camera to show you a lensed version of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat. I'll probably use it for five minutes, appreciate the math that went into it, and move on. But nevertheless, pretty neat.I say that because there's an idea to play with for a v1.1 that would give it staying power for me:Do you have enough processing power on an iPhone to combine this with Augmented Reality? That is to say: can you explore "pinning" a singularity in a fixed region of space so I can essentially walk around it using the phone?Assuming that's possible, you could continue evolving this into a very modest revenue generating app (like 2 bucks per year, see where it goes?) by allowing for people to pin singularities, neutron stars, etc. around their world and selectively sharing those with others who pass by. I'd have fun seeing someone else's pinned singularity next to the Washington monument, for instance. Or generally being able to play with gravity effects on light via AR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend using a different preview screenshot on the App Store page. The first (most important) screenshot is without the effect at all. The use of the galaxy image doesn’t really reflect what it’s like to use the app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42185668</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A failure in the UK air traffic control system was caused by a misidentified waypoint related to a French flight plan for a drone delivery operation, known as Bee. The incident led to significant disruptions in air traffic management, as the misidentification of the waypoint resulted in a loss of control for the UK air traffic service, prompting emergency protocols and impacting numerous flights. Investigations have been initiated to assess the technical issues and improve safety measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know how long that failure mode has been in place or if this is relevant, but it makes me think of analogous times I've encountered similar:When automated systems are first put in place, for something high risk, "just shut down if you see something that may be an error" is a totally reasonable plan. After all, literally yesterday they were all functioning without the automated system, if it doesn't seem to be working right better switch back to the manual process we were all using yesterday, instead of risk a catastrophe.In that situation, switching back to yesterday's workflow is something that won't interrupt much.A couple decades -- or honestly even just a couple years -- later, that same fault system, left in place without much consideration because it rarely is triggered -- is itself catastrophic, switching back to a rarely used and much more inefficient manual process is extremely disruptive, and even itself raises the risk of catastrophic mistakes.The general engineering challenge, is how we deal with little-used little-seen functionality (definitely thinking of fault-handling, but there may be other cases) that is totally reasonable when put in place, but has not aged well, and nobody has noticed or realized it, and even if they did it might be hard to convince anyone it's a priority to improve, and the longer you wait the more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI: nm = nautical miles, not nanometers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good news: the system successfully detected an error and didn't send bad data to air traffic controllers.Bad News: the system can't recover from an error in an individual flight plan, bringing the whole system down with it (along with the backup system since it was running the same code).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136817</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the efficient inference capabilities of the LLaMA 40.5 billion parameter language model on Cerebras Systems’ AI hardware. It highlights the benefits of using Cerebras’ technology for large-scale model deployment, including reduced latency and increased throughput compared to traditional methods.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is astonishingly fast. I’m struggling to get over 100 tok/s on my own Llama 3.1 70b implementation on an 8x H100 cluster.I’m curious how they’re doing it. Obviously the standard bag of tricks (eg, speculative decoding, flash attention) won’t get you close. It seems like at a minimum you’d have to do multi-node inference and maybe some kind of sparse attention mechanism?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure if they're comparing apples to apples on the latency here. There are roughly three parts to the latency: the throughput of the context/prompt, the time spent queueing for hardware access, and the other standard API overheads (network, etc).From what I understand, several, maybe all, of the comparison services are not based on provisioned capacity, which means that the measurements include the queue time. For LLMs this can be significant. The Cerebras number on the other hand almost certainly doesn't have some unbounded amount of queue time included, as I expect they had guaranteed hardware access.The throughput here is amazing, but to get that throughput at a good latency for end-users means over-provisioning, and it's unclear what queueing will do to this. Additionally, does that latency depend on the machine being ready with the model, or does that include loading the model if necessary? If using a fine-tuned model does this change the latency?I'm sure it's a clear win for batch workloads where you can keep Cerebras machines running at 100% utilisation and get 1k tokens/s constantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What you can do with current-gen models, along with RAG, multi-agent &amp; code interpreters, the wall is very much model latency, and not accuracy any more.There are so many interactive experiences that could be made possible at this level of token throughput from 405B class models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42178761</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps interesting (for some) to note that hyperfine is from the same author as at least a few other "ne{w,xt} generation" command line tools (that could maybe be seen as part of "rewrite it in Rust", but I don't want to paint the author with a brush they disagree with!!): fd (find alternative; https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), bat ("supercharged version of the cat command"; https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), and hexyl (hex viewer; https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl).  (And certainly others I've missed!)Pointing this out because I myself appreciate comments that do this.For myself, `fd` is the one most incorporated into my own "toolbox" -- used it this morning prior to seeing this thread on hyperfine!  So, thanks for all that, sharkdp if you're reading!Ok, end OT-ness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've also had a good experience using the 'perf'[^1] tools for when I don't want to install 'hyperfine'.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the disruption of an undersea cable connecting Germany and Finland, which has led to significant internet connectivity issues in both countries. The disruption is attributed to a ship's anchor reportedly damaging the cable, resulting in slower internet speeds and service outages. Authorities are working to investigate the incident and restore normal operations. The incident highlights the vulnerability of underwater infrastructure and its impact on digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth mentioning that cable breakages happen quite often; globally about 200 times per year [1] and the article itself mentions that just last year, two other cables and a gas pipeline were taken out by an anchor. The Gulf of Finland is evidently quite shallow. From what I understand, cable repair ships are likely to use ROVs for parts of repair jobs but only when the water is shallow so hopefully they can figure out whether the damage looks like sabotage before they sever the cable to repair it. Of course, if you're a bad actor and want plausible deniability, maybe you'd make it look like anchor damage or, deliberately drag an anchor right over the cables.Cable repairs are certainly annoying and for the operator of the cable, expensive. However, they are usually repaired relatively quickly. I'd be more worried if many more cables were severed at the same time. If you're only going to break one or two a year, you might as well not bother.1: https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Joint statement by the Foreign Ministers of Finland and Germany on the severed undersea cable in the Baltic Sea&gt; We are deeply concerned about the severed undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany in the Baltic Sea. The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway. Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hammer example made me remember something. I did some Aikido long ago, and the instructor spent quite a lot of time showing us how to grip things like sticks. As I remember it, instead of the instinctive way of just forming a fist around it, we should instead start from the little finger, wrapping the fingers one by one, but letting the index finger actually rest more along the handle than wrapping it. That way, supposedly, the grip is just as good, but more flexible and the index finger can help with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I partially amputated (at the joint closest to the nail) my index finger a decade ago, and it’s been a huge impediment. This has motivated me to seek out some other opinions.Sent it to some doctor friends and they are floored by the writing style as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a violinist (amateur but play regularly). When I have an important note, which is held for a while and needs vibrato, I frequently decide to shift my left hand position so that my middle finger is responsible, rather than the index finger. It feels stronger, easier to nail the intonation (pitch) with precision, and freer to perform the desired type of vibrato. (String players do vibrato by wiggling the left hand finger, which affects the pitch and overtones / oscillation modes of the string.) In fact, I tend to avoid using the index finger on notes that require vibrato.That preference might be explained here, by the precision/strength combination. I tried holding a hammer as described in the author’s hammer exercise, and there’s similarity, though it requires much more weight-holding. The left hand doesn’t hold the weight of the violin (consider a cello or a guitar with shoulder strap), but a little grip strength is required to securely hold down the string, especially with vibrato.Overall, fascinating article. I feel quite motivated to read more on hand anatomy and biomechanics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42178916</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a very cool demo! Well done!One suggestion for fixing the cursor drift during finger taps is instead of using hand position, use index finger. Then tap the middle finger to the thumb for selection. Since this doesn’t change the cursor position, yet is still a comfortable and easy to parse action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It unsettled me a lot about just how much work was put into making the JavaScript version of this work instead of a purely Python version, due to how OpenCV works. I wonder how universal the laggy OpenCV thing is, because my friend faced it too when working on an OpenCV application. Is it so unavoidable that the only option is to not use Python? I really hope that there is another way of going about this.Anyways, I am very glad that you put in all that effort to make the JavaScript version work well. Working under limitations is sometimes cool. I remember having to figure out how PyTorch evaluated neural networks, and having to convert the PyTorch neural network into Java code that could evaluate the model without any external libraries (it was very inefficient) for a Java code competition. Although there may have been a better way, what I did was good enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool, but a moving average filter is pretty bad at removing noise - it tends to be longer than it needs to be because its passband is so bad. Try using a IIR filter instead. You don't need to deal with calculating the coefficients correctly because they'll just be empirically determined.out = last_out * x + input * (1-x)Where x is between zero and one. Closer to one, the more filtering you'll do. You can cascade these too, to make a higher order filter, which will work even better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42185842</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "shift left" in software development, which emphasizes integrating testing and quality assurance earlier in the development process. It highlights the benefits of adopting this approach, such as improved product quality and reduced time to market. However, the article also notes that while "shift left" is significant, it represents only a part of a broader strategy necessary for enhancing software development practices. Key challenges and additional methodologies are explored to create a more comprehensive understanding of effective development cycles in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those not aware, Shift Left[1] is (at this point) an old term that was coined for a specific use case, but now refers to a general concept. The concept is that, if you do needed things earlier in a product cycle, it will end up reducing your expense and time in the long run, even if it seems like it's taking longer for you to "get somewhere" earlier on. I think this[2] article is a good no-nonsense explainer for "Why Shift Left?".[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing [2] https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-is-shift-left-and-w...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my org [1], "shift left" means developers do more work sooner.So before we clearly clarify product requirements, we start the build early with assumptions that can change. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, which just means we end up net neutral.But an executive somewhere up the management chain can claim more productivity. Lame.[1] I work at a bank.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In software shifting left often also means putting more tasks into the hands of the person with the most context, aka, moving deployment from ops to developers.The main benefits you get from this is reduced context switching, increased information retention, increased ownership.But it has to go with tooling, and process that enables that. If you have a really long deployment process where devs can get distracted then they will lose context switching between tasks. If you make every Dev a one man army that has to do everything on their own you won't be able to ship anything and your infra will be a disjointed mess.They key thing is reducing toil, and increasing decision making power within a single team/person.From the sound of the article they might be just squishing two teams together? What's the advancement that made the two steps be able to happen at the same time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183561</guid></item><item><title>13.

Both of us made over $4000 a week in our early 20s-Now out of those 4 buildings I think black berry only has two floors of one building-Waterloo has seen serious decline since the death of RIM-Not sure it will ever come back, most people including myself left years ago.-there has been a serious condo tower boom, but that sucks for “walkability” and it’s radically changed the area-if you attended university in Waterloo in the 2000s and lived off campus, wherever you lived is likely gone and there is a condo tower there now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That random “J” at the end of the messages brings me back to mail circa 2010.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author’s experience using Erlang's hot code updates feature, which allows for code changes without stopping the system. It covers the importance of this feature in maintaining uptime and flexibility in software development, especially for systems requiring high availability. The author provides insights into the process of implementing hot code upgrades, including practical examples, challenges faced, and tips for ensuring smooth transitions between versions. The piece emphasizes the benefits of using Erlang for building resilient applications and the efficient management of live code updates.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I worked at Discord, we used BEAM hot code loading pretty extensively, built a bunch of tooling around it to apply and track hot-patches to nodes (which in turn could update the code on &gt;100M processes in the system.) It allowed us to deploy hot-fixes in minutes (full tilt deploy could complete in a matter of seconds) to our stateful real-time system, rather than the usual ~hour long deploy cycle. We generally only used it for "emergency" updates though.The tooling would let us patch multiple modules at a time, which basically wrapped `:rpc.call/4` and `Code.eval_string/1` to propagate the update across the cluster, which is to say, the hot-patch was entirely deployed over erlang's built-in distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code reloading on embedded Nerves devices is fantastic. If you have non-trivial hardware or state you can just hot load new code to test a fix live. Great for integration testing.I literally used hot code reloading a few weeks back to fix a 4-20 mA circuit on a new beta firmware while a client was watching in remote Colorado. Told them I was “fixing a config”. Tested it on our device and then they checked it out over a satellite PLC system. Then I made an update Nerves FW, uploaded it. Made the client happy!Note that I’ve found that using scp to copy the files to /tmp and then use Code.compile to work better than copy and paste in IEx. The error messages get proper line numbers.It’s also very simple to write a helper function to compile all the code in /tmp and then delete it. I’ve got a similar one in my project that scp’s any changed elixir files in my project over. It’s pretty nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work on a pretty big elixir project that had many clients with long lived connections that ran jobs that weren't easily resumable. Our company had a language agnostic deployment strategy based on docker, etc which meant we couldn't do hot code updates even though they would have saved our customers some headache.Honestly I wish we had had the ability to do both. Sometimes a change is so tricky that the argument that "hot code updates are complicated and it'll cause more issues than it will solve" is very true, and maybe a deploy that forces everyone to reconnect is best for that sort of change. But often times we'd deploy some mundane thing where you don't have to worry about upgrading state in a running gen server or whatever, and it'd be nice to have minimal impact.Obviously that's even more complexity piled onto the system, but every time I pushed some minor change and caused a retry that (in a perfect world at least...) didn't need to retry, I winced a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42187761</guid></item><item><title>15.

If it does, then make sure that the step size is chosen to be smaller than the wave length of the function.Nyquist limit, but for numerical integration?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks a bit sloppy to hardcode so many constants in a single file: `src/gauss_quadrature/legendre.rs`. Isn't it possible to generate them with the help of rust macros in the same way Julia uses metaprogramming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182784</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article "99 Bottles of OOP" by Sandy Metz discusses the challenges and considerations in object-oriented programming (OOP) through a playful examination of the classic programming exercise, "99 Bottles of Beer." It emphasizes the importance of understanding design principles and the implications of code decisions, advocating for clear and maintainable code. Metz highlights the iterative process of code refinement, the need for good design patterns, and the value of writing tests to ensure robustness. The overall message is about improving programming skills through focused practice and thoughtful design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN's automatic title editing strikes again. The title of this submission should presumably be: "99 Bottles of OOP now available in Python".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to mention that despite OOP being in the title, I thought this book had a lot to teach that isn't specific to OOP architecture or OOP languages. Really, I think the star of the show is TDD and refactoring.For a short intro to Sandi's style and approach, I always recommend this 35min talk: https://youtu.be/OMPfEXIlTVE?si=Ird6t8uDN86T06Y7Aside from any specifically educational content, as a talk it is fantastic - funny, smart, well put together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OOP is an industry of its own which generates a ton of incidental complexity. See       "Object-Oriented Programming is Bad" by Brian Wills (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM) and most of Rich Hickey's excellent videos, especially his keynote at Rails Conf 2012 where he basically told the Ruby crowd they're doing it wrong (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147860</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a function designed to approximate the raising of small numbers to small irrational powers. It outlines the mathematical approach used to create this function, including its derivation and applications. The author provides detailed explanations and examples to illustrate how the function can be utilized in practical scenarios, highlighting its accuracy and efficiency in approximating the complex calculations involved in exponentiation with irrational numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

Half the problems in EE become trivial once you learn this.  Sometimes the universe does a bad job of complying with the approximation though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see someone else who watches Michael Penn videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After following the correct link from @nomemory in the comments, this is good for a bit of a chuckle once you see the formula.  If you can evaluate the formula you probably have a calculator or computer on hand and could compute the original value to double precision (I'm not even sure that the approximation would compute faster, but I didn't benchmark it).But even though the approximation has no value in a real world application, the description of getting to the approximation is really good.  I've never heard of Pade approximations before, and I liked the lead in from small angle approximations and Taylor series.  I'd say this post is accessible to (and can be appreciated by) advanced undergraduates in engineering or math or comp sci.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174105</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Riak has been maintained through the post-basho years by engineers at some of its larger customers (disclaimer - including myself).The focus has been on trying to improve the stability of the database when subject to complex failure scenarios under stressful load, with minimal need for urgent operator intervention.  The focus has been on keeping those existing operators happy rather than seeking out new users.  Evolution of the product since basho has been slow but significant.The project now has support from Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, and we're looking to invest some effort over the next few months explaining what we've done, and to start to articulate what we see as the future for Riak.  So if you're interested watch this space.It is expected to remain a niche product though.  However, it may still find a home for those demanding specific non-functional requirements, with an acceptance of some functional constraints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really hits home and makes me happy to see on the HN front page.Nearly 10 years later and I still consider my time working on Riak at Basho the highlight of my career.After leaving, my original plan was to found "Basho 2.0" after my non-compete expired. But, unexpected personal/family hardships in 2015-2018 made big-tech money the better choice for awhile, and Cloud/competitors continued to chip away at the market.Often stil regret not taking that path.But, happy to see technology I'm very fond of still living on and providing value to the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I led a migration from Mongo to Riak at Shareaholic about 12 years ago: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/migrating-to-riak-at-sh...It was successful at first, but ultimately we traded one set of problems for another (how novel, I know).In particular, I underestimated the pain of troubleshooting the database itself. Riak was a new product, we were a small team that had never run anything on BEAM, and ultimately we lost too many days debugging and trying to make sense of Erlang stacktraces.The Basho folks were great, and to this day I appreciate how quickly they fixed a number of bugs for us. But ultimately it wasn't enough -- we found problems faster than they could be patched.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42187766</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my upper-division analog electronics class (the hard one), our lab project throughout the quarter was to build an analog computer that simulated the physics of a bouncing ball. Physical variables of the system were adjustable (gravity constant, coefficient of restitution, etc), and the ball was "released" by pressing a button. The output was viewed on an oscilloscope.One of the hardest 10 weeks of my life, but also one of the most rewarding. Our team was one of the few that actually got it working in the end. I had to custom-make a gigantic breadboard to hold the entire circuit.Today I still work in hardware, but mostly with digital circuits. While my analog knowledge has decayed over the last decade, that project and it's success gives me great confidence any time I have to deal with the domain.If you want to take a look, here's a pretty similar project: https://www.analogmuseum.org/english/examples/bouncing_ball_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s no better introduction to signals and systems than a modular synthesizer IMO - the combination of tactility and audibility for multi-sensory learning is so great at building intuition - and more importantly, excitement! - for signal processing.This looks like a cool project in the same spirit!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a different sort of analog computer, I have long been wondering about a “compiler” for fluidic logic that can output devices you could 3D print which would then operate on pneumatic or hydraulic signals. Probably entirely useless, but wouldn’t be affected by an EMP!That idea was shamelessly inspired by the soft fluidic robot some years back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42185715</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am curious why the author chose a genetic algorithm rather than standard backprop to distill the evil. Logistic regression seems like a pretty reasonable choice and it’ll be a lot faster than a genetic algorithm. Add an L1 penalty for sparsity.In the past I’ve tried distilling not just the eval function but the outcome of the search (something like depth 20) in a neural net. It kind of works, but not very well until the net is pretty big. Deepmind did something similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As part of my undergrad work, I used similar principles to the article (steady state genetic algorithms) to create a bot capable of playing Reversi where the fitness function was loosely defined as a set of "weights" on each square across the 8x8 board. These were used as part of the evaluation function in the classic minimax algorithm.We trained over the course of 5-6 days, and the end generation was capable of beating an intermediate player but got completely destroyed by experts.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a Suzuki model from India that impressively received a five-star safety rating in crash tests, despite its low price of $8,000. It highlights the significance of this rating for consumers in the Indian market, emphasizing the increasing focus on vehicle safety in a country where many affordable cars often skimp on safety features. The piece praises the Suzuki for its commitment to safety standards while maintaining an economical price point, contrasting it with other budget vehicles in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to buy one of the Maruti Suzuki Jimnys. It's been sold in Europe, but you can't get one in Europe anymore because its not complying with arbitrary eco-guidelines (Which somehow a G-Wagon, a Defender or a Land Cruiser are).
Prices for 50K KM Used Cars are nearly double the price of new ones.
Since also LADA isn't on the European market anymore, you can't get a small off-road capable vehicle anymore.
Okay, there are no dedicated off-road vehicles anymore, only luxury SUVs that no one can afford and no one would take off road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May I suggest replacing the URL with the actual article at  https://www.motor1.com/news/740524/suzuki-dzire-five-stars-c...The current link is an ad-infested repost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be aware that for global NCAP, safety ratings are dependent on the vehicle class. If a subcompact car receives 5 stars, this does not mean it has the same probability of survivability in full frontal crash as a large executive luxury sedan that received 5 stars.In fact, if there was a head-on crash between this car and Mercedes E-Class, and you're planning to be in one of the cars, I would advise you to chose the Mercedes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119675</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the research of a neuroscientist who taught rats to drive in a controlled experiment, demonstrating how the anticipation of fun and enjoyable experiences can significantly enrich life. By allowing the rats to engage in a task that provided them with a sense of control and enjoyment, the study highlights the importance of play and the positive impact of seeking out pleasurable experiences on behavior and brain function. The findings suggest that similar principles may apply to humans, emphasizing the value of anticipating joy and creating opportunities for fun in our lives to enhance overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of the orangutan driving a golf cart: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DJsn1QivbKMHe has mastered it. He clearly understands the concept of roads vs sidewalks. He can drive using one hand. And most importantly, he obviously has a great time doing that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"One day, a student noticed something strange: One of the rats in the group trained to expect positive experiences had its tail straight up with a crook at the end, resembling the handle of an old-fashioned umbrella."For anyone having, being friends with, are interested in cats will recognize this behavior. If you meet a cat on the street and it raises its tail like this, it will also probably come up to you. A cat that sweeps the tail back and fort, often with the end of it a bit jerky is probably afraid, angry, hesitant and does not want to engage. It should be left alone unless you want to feel the sharp end of those retractable razor blades.Cats also use the same patterns between each other. And interestingly some dogs use the same patterns too. Tiger puppies seem to do this also (as seen in documentaries). So, at least to me, there seems to be common 'language' to express feelings and interests between some animals equipped with tails.I would have thought this should have been a known thing, possibly even for the driving rat scientists. Anybody on HN that have some references into known ´tail language´?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08G8u7sk2JoA different one, in a home environment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHMc3-f3v8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42179774</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The HyrumToken project on GitHub offers a solution for creating and managing access tokens using Hyrum's Law as a guiding principle. It aims to enhance security and control over API token usage in software development, making it easier for developers to manage token lifecycle events such as creation, validation, and expiration. The repository includes documentation, code samples, and implementation guidelines, allowing users to integrate token management into their applications efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the deeper message of this is: Pagination tokens are a shitty API and you should really offer something that gives the client more options.Pagination tokens feel great if you're providing the API, because they let you retain maximum control over API usage and let you do all kinds of optimizations in the back-end. But they are really limiting for the clients and - as we've seen here - often fail to address even basic use cases, such as going back a page or even reliably reloading the same page you're on. (Not even starting about arbitrary seeking.)This leads to dreaded infinite-scrolling or "click to load more" UIs, which overload my browser and will have me start again from the very beginning should I have to reload the page.I think it's also very easy to miss for non-technical stakeholders just how constraining this API is. E.g. in the OP's story, I could easily imagine some nontechnical PM assigning tasks like this:- back-end team: Implement data access API using pagination tokens (because the devs said this is the best way to do it)- front-end team: Implement the data view UI, including "next", " previous" and "go to page" buttons, linkability and page numbers in the URL. (Because that's what the product owners ordered)Without having some specific knowledge about how pagination tokens work, it's easy to miss that those requirements are contradictory - unless someone cheats, like in this case the front-end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pagination tokens have been a bane to my existence.  I'm basically this backend engineer.  Have done these exact steps.  Between worry the frontend will decode and annoyance at explaining how tokens work, I am growing to hate working with frontend teams.Even worse, when I have to explain that they may get an empty result with a token meaning they need to call again.  Unbounded service call means nothing, it seems.Kudos on this project!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this really a problem we need to solve with technology?I've never seen this happen in the real world. But by the motivation presented in the repo as well as some commentaries in this thread I got the impression this is a miscommunication issue.I my experience most mid-level engineers are fully aware about the differences between "pagination token" and "page/size" based pagination strategies.So when this kind of situation happens I get the impression that both teams were never in the same page. Maybe someone wrote "the api needs to have pagination" in a design doc and nobody bothered to ask for the details. To make things worse this problems only appear when we start to make some e2e tests, but by that point the deadline is generally pretty close. And this creates a big incentive for people to get creative in order to deliver on time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42179773</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post got the big one: Total Store Ordering (TSO).The rest are all techniques in reasonably common use, but unless you have hardware support for x86's strong memory ordering, you cannot get very good x86-on-ARM performance, because it's by no means clear when strong memory ordering matters, and when it doesn't, inspecting existing code - so you have to liberally sprinkle memory barriers around, which really kill performance.The huge and fast L1I/L1D cache doesn't hurt things either... emulation tends cache-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super interesting.
Putting my PM hat on, I wonder: how many x86 apps on Apple still benefit from this much performance? What's the coverage? The switch to M1 happened 4 years ago, so the software was designed for hardware nearly half a decade old.Excellent engineering and nice that it was built properly. Is this something that Linux / Wine / the Steam compatibility layer already benefit from?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardization of future Arm PCs, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182442  The Arm PC Base System Architecture 1.0 (PC-BSA) specifies a standard hardware system architecture for Personal Computers (PCs) that are based on the Arm 64-bit Architecture.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost to create a custom LCD?  Sensor Watch [1] has created a replacement Casio watch LCD for his replacement Casio module, and I can't wait to get mine.  The fact that he's done several iterations of LCD prototypes means that it can't be that out of reach, and yet I somehow doubt the price for qty 5 is going to be that attractive.[1]: https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-wa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty neat! I like the idea of an electronic device for tabletop dice rolling that isn't a smartphone, something with more 'tactile feedback' so to speak- more built-for-purpose and less of a distraction. Obviously you can just roll dice, but having the system-specific math automatically calculated based on the rolls can save so much time and keep the game moving. That's partly why we've largely moved to VTTs (Foundry is excellent)I'm not sure about the wristwatch form factor though, most dice rolls in TTRPGs are visible to everybody as they're made, so I would've expected a device you can place in the center of the table so everyone can see the rolls (the exception being private DM rolls of course). Being system agnostic or programmable would also be really cool, but I can understand why a hobby project would just focus on the game the creators (and 99% of the TTRPG market) are playing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like such a fun product. Similar to another commenter, I don't think it's all that useful, since the tactility of the physical dice roll is such a big part of tabletop gaming (for many people at least). But to me, watch complications are not so much about utility as they are about being cool for its own sake.I would love to see something like this made into a mechanical watch complication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118881</guid></item><item><title>29.

I tried teaching fractions the way I was taught ... but after several days, a test showed it just wasn't working at all. Frustrating for most too.One day about a week later I drew a box on the blackboard, and called it one dollar (still worth something at the time.)I then drew a single vertical line through it, pointed at the left half and asked 'what's this worth?' Slight delay ... '50 cents?' Then I added a horizontal line, pointed at the upper right corner: 'what's this worth?' Soon it was becoming easy! Sixths, eighths... 'take away 3 sevenths, what's left? ... After a couple more hours of this, most of the class easily solved 'simplify 3 sixths' or 'how many quarters to make 2 and a half'. Every few weeks later, we revisited to see what stuck.Works the same in the sciences, for many anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who is a high school math teacher and I was talking to them about how linear algebra and trigonometry are crucial to 3D graphics and rendering. I told them how going from a set of vertices of a cube to showing several cubes in different orientations and positions on a screen is mostly just a series of matrix multiplications, and why the geometric properties of a triangle make it the ideal primitive to use for rendering.The details about computer graphics and such was new to them, but very quickly it made sense to them (mathematically).Later on when they had started a section in their class about triangles they used al this to illustrate and relate the subject to something they were all familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could only find a (legal) pdf[1] for $80.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing parallels between the works of Jane Austen and Charles Darwin, particularly their differing yet complementary perspectives on beauty. It analyzes how both Austen's literary portrayals of social interactions and relationships, and Darwin's scientific studies on evolution and natural selection, address the concept of beauty in their respective contexts. The piece suggests that Austen's insights into human behavior and attraction coincide with Darwin's evolutionary theories, highlighting a shared understanding of beauty that transcends their different disciplines. Ultimately, it emphasizes the convergence of literature and science in examining the role and significance of beauty in human life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was recently reading Washington Irving's first book, from 1809, where he mentioned Darwin arguing that humans are descended from monkeys, and I thought "that seems a little early." Turns out he was talking about Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus, who laid some of the groundwork for Charles, and he was famous for writing romantic poems about scientific subjects like reproduction of flowers to help encourage more people to get involved with science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something not mentioned is that Austen lived very close (c. 2 hour walk away) to the home of Rev Gilbert White, who many regard as the world's first naturalist.His method of detailed observations of common animals, insects and plants living in their natural habitats (rather than dead in cases) was quite revolutionary in its day, became popular in the scientific world at that time and almost certainly influenced indirectly Darwin's own studies. He even wrote a detailed study of earthworms, something Darwin did later famously, though there's no suggestion of direct influence.It would not be a surprise if Austen became well acquainted with the works of a famous local "celebrity" as White as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read someone call Austen the Drosophila melanogaster of evolutionary psychology. They seem to study her work like theologists study bibles. The fruit fly comparison makes it sound like they are studying a specimen. But my theory is that they recognize her as a colleague who happened to write in a different genre.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183192</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution and impact of the MP3 audio format since its inception, highlighting how its compression technology revolutionized music consumption by enabling easier sharing and storage. It delves into both the advantages, such as convenience and accessibility, and the disadvantages, including potential loss of audio quality and the implications for artists and the music industry. The narrative reflects on the cultural shift caused by MP3s in the way people experience music, while also connecting this technological change to broader themes of digital ownership and value in the era of streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1999 when MP3 was getting attention, I tried to do this. I encoded a file, then inverted it, and mixed it back into the original.It didn't cancel anything out.The reason: Mp3 dramatically alters phase. Because all the phases are different, it's hard to naively determine how the signal is altered.Years later, I took the time to write a series of tools to investigate lossy audio: https://andrewrondeau.com/blog/2016/07/deconstructing-lossy-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article could at least have a paragraph explaining (in a dumbed-down way) why various kinds of psychoacoustic masking (temporal, frequency) make what's removed almost inaudible anyway. Reading the linked source (https://www.theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html), he at least used LAME, but at a fixed 128 kbps bitrate, not in VBR mode =(EDIT: nerds should read about sfb21 (https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=LAME_Y_switch), AAC, Vorbis and Opus (CELT) aren't just theoretical improvements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a trick there. A sound can mask another sound. You will not be able to tell the difference with both sounds playing at the same time, but if you subtract them you can hear it because there is no masking.I always loved to test the ears of my "Audiophile" friends. They will tell you how different MP3s are. You make a bet they can not differentiate them in 20 trials better than chance. I won with most people but some professional musicians that can identify little differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42181467</guid></item><item><title>39.

Nuke was then sold to The Foundry and its UI rewritten in Qt, but the legacy (in the form of FLTK) continues.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_(software)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unfamiliar, FLTK is a cross-platform widget library in C++, with bindings to many other languages available. It's vaguely similar to something like Qt, but far simpler and far more developer-friendly. It is excellent; strongly recommended to all, for everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The default FLTK look and feel might be discouraging, but there are some really great native themes shipped for the Rust bindings: https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#wid...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42187640</guid></item><item><title>42.

It's one of those problems that seems really easy, but then you look into it a little bit and decide it's not really worth the effort (and there aren't many practical, independent examples of it in practice). This person not only took the effort – to make something more personally pleasing than TeX – but also took the time to organize their code and share it, in order to decrease the scarcity of such examples.Kudos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is an incredible story of successful yak shaving. I have the same experience, but ultimately my attempts end in failure as I lose interest and sight of the end goal. Kudos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow!

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for the Integuru-AI Venmo Unofficial API provides developers with tools to interact programmatically with Venmo, a popular payment platform. The API enables functionalities such as sending and receiving money, managing friends and transactions, and accessing user data. The repository includes documentation, sample code, and instructions for installation, making it easier for users to integrate Venmo capabilities into their own applications. It serves as a resource for those looking to work with Venmo’s services beyond the official API, offering insights and support for various use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To everyone criticizing this project, you should probably dig a bit to find out what's the context of this project.From the integuru page:&gt; We build integrations with platforms lacking official APIs. We specialize in low-latency integrations via reverse-engineering. All integrations are open-source.So these warnings are probably wasted on someone that is very much aware of what he is doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL Venmo uses GraphQL.It's interesting to note, too, that the current Venmo website posts to https://account.venmo.com/api/eligibility to get a token and then separately to https://account.venmo.com/api/payments to perform the actual payment. Those endpoints and shapes are different than what's in the script, which posts to https://api.venmo.com/v1/payments (https://github.com/Integuru-AI/Venmo-Unofficial-API/blob/a28...). I wonder if the v1 API is an older one used for some other service (the mobile app, maybe?).Thanks for sharing, OP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will not end well.If someone with millions or billions of dollars doesn’t have an official API after operating for years, that’s because they don’t want to have one. You may receive a Cease and Desist letter, or they might block your IPs, or just scramble their markup in ways that are hard to figure out. Whatever their approach, they likely have more money and manpower to throw at stopping you than you have to evade them, especially if you’re doing this to multiple large and powerful companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42178130</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of building observability within applications using ClickHouse, a columnar database designed for analytics. It outlines the importance of observability for monitoring and understanding system performance and behavior, and details how ClickHouse's features enable efficient data ingestion, querying, and analysis. The author provides insights into setting up a basic observability stack with ClickHouse, emphasizing the benefits of real-time data processing and advanced analytics for gaining valuable insights into application performance. The piece aims to guide developers and engineers in implementing effective observability tools using ClickHouse.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see lot of hype around ClickHouse these days. Few years ago I remember TimescaleDB making the rounds, arguably being predecessor for this sort of "observability on SQL" thinking. The article has short paragraph mentioning Timescale, but unfortunately it doesn't really go into comparing it to ClickHouse. How does HN see the situation these days, is ClickHouse simply overtaking Timescale on all axis? That sounds bit of a shame; I have used Timescale a bit and enjoyed it, but just on such small scale that it's operational aspects did not really come up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting read, I was comparing some of these tools earlier for small web shop use while I didn't proceed to setup any of them just yet. Demoed Elastic, SigNoz and Grafana Loki, of which Alloy+Loki seemed to make most sense for my needs and didn't cause too much headache setting up on a tiny VM, so that I would have collection going in the first place and a decent method to grep through it.Currently collecting just exception data from services to GlitchTip (Sentry fork), seems most valuable sysadmin-wise while having most security etc. concerns outsourced to managed hosting companies.Was left curious what anomaly detection methods Elastic has built-in would take to DIY &lt;https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-...&gt; with data frame / statistics / ML libraries (Clojure Noj).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, I recently interviewed Samuel Colvin, Pydantic's author, and he said when designing his observability Saas called LogFire, he tried multiple backends, including ClickHouse.But it didn't work out.One of the reasons is LogFire allows the users to fetch the service data with arbitrary SQL queries.So they had to build their own backend in rust, on top of DataFusion.I used ClickHouse myself and it's been nice, but it's easy when you get to decide what schema you need yourself. For small to medium needs, this plus Grafana works well.But I must admit that the plug and play aspect of great services like Sentry or LogFire make it so easy to setup it's tempting to skip the whole self hosting. They are not that expensive (unlike datadog), and maintaining your observability code is not free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146782</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in primary school (UK) aged about 10 I got flagged by a teacher for being gifted at Maths. At the time there was a local government scheme that put on little lessons at the local research intensive University on a Saturday morning. For me that was incredibly eye opening; nobody in my family had ever been to University and for the first time I also met people who had a shared interest in maths. The cohort of students was very diverse too. I did that for maybe 6 years and then due to cuts it closed down. At that point the staff tried to take it private and it ticked on for a few years during which I used to go and help (first Saturday job!). It was really really great for me, gave me a lot of exposure to advanced things way earlier, and not necessarily things that were on the normal syllabus either, so it didn't leap me forwards ahead of people in school, just gave me a much broader exposure to what maths was. I ended up doing a degree in Theoretical Physics and then a doctorate in computational physics. I vaguely kept in touch with a couple of guys from it, another one did a doctorate is now a researcher in Chemistry and the other did a degree in maths and is a software developer as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the kids are bright, send them to a school or an environment where they can live that out. I don't know about the US but in Germany the quality of schools varies dramatically both between regions and within. I loved computer science, physics and math in high school but my school did very little to encourage this. Only my physics teacher encouraged me and helped me sign up for competitions and a special programme that allowed me to attend university math/physics classes while still in school (I'm not a prodigy by a far shot, just very eager to learn and nerdy).When I came to uni and met other kids with the same desire to learn I was shocked how well they were prepared, they e.g. learned using Mathematica/Maple in school, had real computer science classes and a ton of extracurricular activities. We didn't have any of that, our only capable computer science teacher was an alcoholic and none of the other teachers knew anything about computers. In the end it didn't make a big difference though, I had to catch up a bit on some of the things but it wasn't like they were leagues ahead.The only thing I would be careful with is setting kids on a trajectory where their self worth gets coupled to feeling special or talented. Inevitably once they get into communities where more and more bright kids hang out they will regress to the norm, and some kids don't handle that well. Don't let them think they always need to be the best to be "worth" something, instead teach them to enjoy what they do for the sake of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s absurd to claim being 6 grades ahead in mathematics doesn’t make your kid better than others in many dimensions. Having the mathematical ability to grok a cutting edge paper, or not grok it, can make or break an entire career. It’s detrimental to the child’s development to instill the belief that there’s nothing special about their abilities, because it risks them not finding any value in applying them! That has negative effects on all the levels of the individual, the family, the community and even the greater society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146699</guid></item><item><title>50.

I find the biggest issue for me with pandas is the API, not the speed.So many foot guns, poorly thought through functions, 10s of keyword arguments instead of good abstractions, 1d and 2d structures being totally different objects (and no higher-order structures). I'd take 50% of the speed for a better API.I looked at Polars, which looks neat, but seems made for a different purpose (data pipelines rather than building models semi-interactively).To be clear, this library might be great, it's just a shame for me that there seems no effort to make a Pandas-like thing with better API. Maybe time to roll up my sleeves...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiencyPolars rocked my world by having a sane API, not by being fast. I can see the value in this approach if, like the author, you have a large amount of pandas code you don't want to rewrite, but personally I'm extremely glad to be leaving the pandas API behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135303</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the quality and condition of American roads, highlighting various factors such as infrastructure age, maintenance issues, funding shortfalls, and differing grades across states. It addresses statistics on road conditions, the impact of poor infrastructure on safety and economy, and comparisons with international road systems.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Interestingly, in all cases urban roads are worse quality than rural roads, presumably because they see higher traffic than rural roads.There's more infrastructure under urban roads. Crews come in to fix some utility, shred a section of a lane, patch it poorly with dissimilar materials, and leave.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great analysis but it does focus exclusively on ‘roughness’, which is obviously important but isn’t the be-all-end-all of road quality.One area I notice in particular that roads in the northeast US subjectively feel worse than Europe is in quality of road markings. Constant plow scraping and harsh salting seems to destroy markings.I think it also shows up in the overall fit and finish of road infrastructure - edging and barriers, signage, lighting, maintenance of medians, how curbs and furniture contribute to junction legibility… and of course bridges.One major reason is that European countries typically have national road agencies and consistent standards across the country (because, generally, smaller and less federal). US’s patchwork of federal, state and local road maintenance leads to vastly different budgets and department priorities across the network.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Interestingly, I expected cold places to have lower road quality in general due to things like freeze-thaw cycles and the impact of road salting, but there doesn’t seem to be much correlation. Plenty of cold places (North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota) have good-quality roadsNot sure about those states in particular, but I have anecdotally noticed that some of the places with the harshest winters do some of the least road salting -- because salt is mostly usable for light to moderate snowfall and the people who live in the harshest climates are often better equipped to drive on hard packed snow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42194327</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Epic Games has permitted the Internet Archive to distribute the classic game "Unreal Tournament" and its modifications for free, marking a significant move towards preserving gaming history. This decision aligns with the growing trend of game developers recognizing the importance of archiving and providing access to their older titles. The article discusses the implications of this action for the preservation of video games and how it reflects a shift in the industry towards supporting public access to classic games.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if it was missing some proprietary dependencies I bet the community could replace them.I recently helped port ioquake3 to the web, complete with UDP multiplayer, and set up an online demo using the internet archive's copy of the Quake III demo: https://thelongestyard.link It would be cool to be able to do the same with Unreal Tournament.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unreal Tournament multiplayer with mutators[1] was awesome fun, like the one that made the player avatar grow bigger when the player scored a kill, and vice versa.It's a shame later multiplayer games didn't pick up on the mutator concept. Being able to easily tweak the gameplay mixed it up and added extra challenge or fun.[1]: https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Mutator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fingers crossed UT2004 will end up in the Archive eventually. I still boot it up to play occasionally because nothing else has scratched the arena shooter itch that well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190541</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The tweet from SpaceX discusses a successful launch that highlights their advancements in rocket technology and their goals for space exploration. It emphasizes the mission's achievements, such as payload delivery and advancements in reusable rocket technology, reflecting the company's commitment to reducing costs and improving access to space. The post likely includes images or videos from the launch, showcasing their innovative approach and encouraging public interest and support for future missions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They demonstrated the engines re-lighting in space, which is significant. There had been some questions about this because the engine is of a design that is said to be very tricky to start, and the tank pressurization system of the rocket has the risk of water and CO2 ice forming in the methane tanks, which had caused several failures in past tests flights. So this is a pretty good milestone.So we might start seeing test flights actually entering orbit soon. Possibly even carrying some real payloads soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember there was a phase of Falcon design where it looked like they had perfected barge landing, and then they had a rash of failures.  Later on they admitted to intentionally crashing older boosters so they could find the limits of the hardware.  They were iterating at such a pace that the data was worth more than a recovered booster.  I wonder if that was the case today?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the advantage of the chopsticks landing over splashing the thing down in the ocean?Does an ocean landing cause significant damage that's not present with an on-land chopsticks landing?Presumably there are pretty big advantages considering how much it must have cost to develop the chopsticks approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42188687</guid></item><item><title>9. 1-Bit AI Infrastructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16144</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a novel approach for learning representations of multi-relational data using a framework that incorporates both relational embeddings and an attention mechanism. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex relationships within heterogeneous datasets, aiming to improve performance in tasks such as link prediction and node classification. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over existing techniques. The results indicate that combining relational representation learning with attention mechanisms can lead to more accurate and efficient models in multi-relational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have read about it quite a few weeks ago the first time and I found it very interesting.Now that I have done more than enough CPU design inside FPGAs, I wanted to try something new, some computation heavy things that could benefit from an FPGA. Does anyone here know how feasable it'd be to implement something like that on an FPGA? I only have rather small chips (artix-7 35T and polarfire SoC with 95k logic slices). So I know I won't be able to press a full LLM into that, but something should be possible.Maybe I should refresh the fundamentals though and start with MNIST. But the question is rather: What is a realistic goal  that I could possibly reach with these small FPGAs? Performance might be secondary, I am rather interested in what's possible regarding complexity/features on a small device.Also has anyone here compiled openCL (or GL?) kernels for FPGAs and can give me a starting point? I was wondering if it's possible to have a working backend for something like tinygrad[1]. I think this would be a good way to learn all the different layers on how such frameworks actually work- [1] https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems like arxiv replaced 'bitnet.cpp' with a link 'this http url', even though '.cpp' is clearly not a tld.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of SQL and graph-based approaches to solve the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). It highlights how traditional relational databases can be enhanced with graph structures to efficiently manage and query complex relationships within data. The author presents various techniques for integrating graph theory principles with SQL queries, emphasizing the benefits of this hybrid approach for optimizing performance in scenarios involving constraints. Real-world applications and examples illustrate the effectiveness of combining these methodologies for better data handling and query execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42195994"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post mentions the idea that querying a database D can be understood algebraically as enumerating all morphisms Q -&gt; D, where Q is the "classifying" database of the query, i.e. a minimal database instance that admits a single "generic" result of the query. You can use this to give a neat formulation of Datalog evaluation. A Datalog rule then corresponds a morphism P -&gt; H, where P is the classifying database instance of the rule body and H is the classifying database instance for matches of both body and head. For example, for the the transitivity rule  edge(x, z) :- edge(x, y), edge(y, z).

you'd take for P the database instance containing two rows (a_1, a_2) and (a_2, a_3), and the database instance H contains additionally (a_1, a_3). Now saying that a Database D satisfies this rule means that every morphism P -&gt; D (i.e., every match of the premise of the rule) can be completed to a commuting diagram  P --&gt; D
  |    ^
  |   /
  ⌄  /
  Q 

where the additional map is the arrow Q -&gt; D, which corresponds to a match of both body and head.This kind of phenomenon is known in category theory as a "lifting property", and there's rich theory around it. For example, you can show in great generality that there's always a "free" way to add data to a database D so that it satisfies the lifting property (the orthogonal reflection construction/the small object argument). Those are the theoretical underpinnings of the Datalog engine I'm sometimes working on [1], and there they allow you to prove that Datalog evaluation is also well-defined if you allow adjoining new elements during evaluation in a controlled way. I believe the author of this post is involved in the egglog project [2], which might have similar features as well.[1] https://github.com/eqlog/eqlog
[2] https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone curious: the performance difference between Clang and GCC on the example C solution for verbal arithmetic comes down to Clang's auto-vectorisation (deducing SIMD) whilst GCC here sticks with scalar, which is why the counter brings Clang closer in line to GCC (https://godbolt.org/z/xfdxGvMYP), and it's actually a pretty nice example of auto-vectorisation (and its limitations) in action, which is a fun tangent from this article (given its relevance to high-performance SMT/SAT solving for CSP)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When SQL can't internally optimise a query into a more efficient constraint problem, unrolling joins is the key. This once MSSQL hacker got to the point of optimising queries with large amounts of joins or CTEs to just populating a single table's columns with one query per one to a few columns at a time (two minute locking queries down to about two seconds.) After that, I started using SQL to generate SQL and run that for really curly requirements. That gives you the ability to write queries that can search for a particular value in any column in any table, or find changes in the past 5 minutes in any column in any table within a fairly quick timeframe. And that's great for debugging applications that interface with the database or identifying rogue table changes. Without needing a transaction log. Programmer's paradise :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42195994</guid></item><item><title>11.

Chip named 'Newnew Polar Bear' under Chinese flag and Chinese company Hainan Xin Xin Yang Shipping Co, Ltd. (aka Torgmoll) with CEO named Yelena V. Maksimova, drags anchor in the seabed cutting cables. Chinese investigation claims storm was the reason, but there was no storm, just normal windy autumn weather. The ship just lowered one anchor and dragged it with engines running long time across the seabed until the anchor broke.These things happen sometimes, ship anchors sometimes damage cables, but not this often and without serious problems in the ship. Russians are attempting plausible deniability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Danish defense forces now confirms their presence but they are not providing any other information right now: https://x.com/forsvaretdk/status/1859195509866381402(This is also a rare English-language tweet from an account that usually only tweets in Danish)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And 4 days ago a Russian spy ship was escorted out of Irish waters:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/russian-spy-sh...So definitely seems like a coordinated attempt to destabilise Europe ahead of anticipated peace talks early next year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42191394</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Embedding functionality into strings prevents any kind of static analysis. The same issue as embedding plain SQL, plain regexes, etc..I am always in favor of declarative approaches where applicable. But whenever they are embedded in this way, you get this static analysis barrier and a possible mismatch between the imperative and declarative code, where you change a return type or field declaratively and it doesn't come up as an error in the surrounding code.A positive example is VerbalExpressions in Java, which only allow expressing valid regular expressions and every invalid regular expression is inexpressible in valid java code. Jooq is another example, which makes incorrect (even incorrectly typed) SQL code inexpressible in Java.I know python is a bit different, as there is no extensive static analysis in the compiler, but we do indeed have a lot of static analysis tools for python that could be valuable. A statically type-safe query is a wonderful thing for safety and maintainability and we do have good type-checkers for python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would prefer something like `{"name": contains("k")}`, where contains("k") returns an object with a custom __eq__ that compares equal to any string (or iterable) that contains "k". Then you can just filter by equality.I recently started using this pattern for pytest equality assertions, as pytest helpfully produces a detailed diff on mismatch. It's not perfect, as pytest doesn't always produce a correct diff with this pattern, but it's better than some alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting... I've been playing with the idea of embedding more python in my C, no cython or anything just using &lt;Python.h&gt; and &lt;numpy/arrayobject.h&gt;. From one perspective it's just "free" C-bindings to a lot of optimized packages. Trying some different C-libraries, the python code is often faster. Python almost becomes C's package managerE.g. sorting 2^23 random 64-bit integers: qsort: 850ms, custom radix sort: 250ms, ksort.h: 582ms, np.sort: 107ms (including PyArray_SimpleNewFromData, PyArray_Sort). Where numpy uses intel's x86-simd-sort I believe.E.g. inserting 8M entries into a hash table (random 64-bit keys and values): MSI-style hash table: ~100ns avg insert/lookup, cc_map: ~95ns avg insert/lookup, Python.h: 91ns insert, 60ns lookupI'm curious if OPs tool might fit in similarly. I've found lmdb to be quite slow even in tmpfs with no sync, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42144369</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the many fun/cool things about Tiny Glade is that it quietly has one of the most advanced realtime global illumination lighting engines shipping in any game today, and it’s all completely custom for just this game. One of the devs, Tomasz Stachowiak, is a big deal in the realtime rendering world and previously was at DICE and Embark; at Embark he led the Kajiya experimental realtime GI project [1] that made quite a splash in the rendering world a while back.The other dev, Anastasia Opara, is a big name in the procedural graphics world. She gave one of my favorite presentations on the topic a few years ago [2].Anyhow if you can’t tell I’m a big fan of both the game and the devs. :)[1] https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya
[2] https://youtu.be/dpYwLny0P8M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is likely the first gamedev project written entirely in Rust and Vulkan to achieve significant financial success on Steam.I'm genuinely proud of the authors — they've set an inspiring example and given us hope for a bright future where the Rust ecosystem serves as a foundation for unique and creative game development projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny Glade is a beautiful piece of technical art. It's worth playing even if the genre is not normally your thing.Procedural art is fascinating and worthy of a deep dive too since it combines art, modelling, rendering, programming and maths (constraint solvers, discrete optimization, more).Anastasia Opara (“procedural art nerd”) has a Gumroad with procedural art tutorials that show how to create environments procedurally with Houdini: https://anopara.gumroad.com/ (the first one is free)Tomasz Stachowiak (“technical debt generator”) gave a talk at GPC 2024 earlier this month called “rendering tiny glades with entirely too much ray marching” (no recording I can find yet but worth keeping an eye on): https://www.graphicsprogrammingconference.nl/#tiny-gladeOutside of the Tiny Glade team, Oskar Stålberg (Townscaper) is worth following for his frequent insights into proc-gen: https://x.com/OskSta&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190065</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When maintaining a quantum memory, you measure parity checks of the quantum error correcting code. These parity checks don't contain any information about the logical state, just (partial) information about the error, so the logical quantum information remains coherent through the process (i.e. the logical part of the state is not collapsed).These measurements are classical data, and a computation is required in order to infer the most likely error that led to the measured syndrome. This process is known as decoding.This work is a model that acts as a decoding algorithm for a very common quantum code -- the surface code. The surface code is somewhat like the quantum analog of a repetition code in a sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, an inherently error-prone computation is being corrected by another very error prone computation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;AlphaQubit, a recurrent-transformer-based neural-network architecture that learns to predict errors in the logical observable based on the syndrome inputs (Methods and Fig. 2a). This network, after two-stage training—pretraining with simulated samples and finetuning with a limited quantity of experimental samples (Fig. 2b)—decodes the Sycamore surface code experiments more accurately than any previous decoder (machine learning or otherwise)&gt;One error-correction round in the surface code. The X and Z stabilizer information updates the decoder’s internal state, encoded by a vector for each stabilizer. The internal state is then modified by multiple layers of a syndrome transformer neural network containing attention and convolutions.I can't seem to find a detailed description of the architecture beyond this bit in the paper and the figure it references. Gone are the days when Google handed out ML methodologies like candy...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.So when those times have occurred I've (we've more accurately) adopted what I refer to the "deer in the headlights" response to just about anything non-trivial.  "Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take."  Then you'll get asked to "ballpark it" because that's what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done "ahead of time" and look good.Now, I've had good managers who totally didn't need this strategy, and I loved 'em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can't be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is about modernization projects, which have soft deadlines because ostensibly the legacy software is still running while you're developing the replacement. There's always budget pressure, and promises may have been made, and users may be hoping for new features and eliminated frustrations... but if the replacement is a day late, it really wouldn't matter much.Conversely, if you're trying to launch a space probe and the planets are no longer in the right positions for the required gravity assist, your spacecraft will not get where it needs to go. Or if you're a little $100M/yr toolmaker, and Ford asks you for a die for the 2026 F150 production line, to be delivered by March, and the contract states you owe a $20,000 per MINUTE penalty if you're late...you don't wait until February to say something surprising happened and it's not going to be ready.  You don't sign on that dotted line unless you know for certain that you can do it.Ford or NASA won't bat an eye when you tell them that a quote is going to cost $XX,XXX. They won't be surprised when they give you an ECO and you say that it's going to take 3 weeks and $8,000 to deliver a part that everyone knows you can probably make by hand in 30 minutes, they know that you're hedging against those deadlines, and pricing in the acceptance phase and inspection phase and contingency plans and everything else that makes their deadline-heavy industry function.But if you tell someone at OP's modernization group that due to incomplete information you think that the 30-minute task to change the text of that button will take "no more than 3 weeks and $8,000" they'll laugh you out the door. Optimistic estimates get rewarded, pessimistic estimates get discouraged, accurate estimates are irrelevant, and in the end you're constantly behind schedule and no one's really surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1505 Michelangelo gave an estimate of five years to finish the tomb for Pope Julius II.Due to small side projects like the painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling it took around 40.Failure to meet the deadline informed by the estimate meant that the scale of the project was massively reduced because: Pope Julius II had died prior to completion, there were changes requested by the customer (both Julius and his heirs), supply chain issues, contract renegotiations, labor disputes, shortages of qualified workers, and money running out due to the long duration of the project.So, since 1505 at least?The funny thing is that the pope isn't even interred there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42187506</guid></item><item><title>16.

Has anyone seen whether that’s because the attacker only targeted that platform or is it actually stopped by something like pointer protection?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The vulnerabilities, credited to Google’s TAG (Threat Analysis Group)Do they find these by monitoring the brokers of zero days or analyzing devices of people who are being targeted?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42189581</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on integrating Astral, a framework for managing machine learning models, with PyTorch. It covers essential steps such as installation, configuration, and usage of both libraries together, allowing users to efficiently manage their model's lifecycle. The guide includes code snippets, explanations of key concepts, and best practices to streamline the development process for machine learning applications, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to leverage the capabilities of PyTorch alongside Astral.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently watched a talk by the author of uv that was surprisingly fascinating [1]. He goes into a few of the more notable hacks that they had to come up with to make it as fast as it is. The most interesting thing for me was that package resolution in python given constraints defined (eg. in requirements.txt) maps to a boolean satisfiability problem which is NP-complete. So uv uses a custom SAT solver to do this. I totally under-appreciated how much goes into this software and I'm bummed I have to use Poetry at work after having watched this talk.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKTfG1GXYQedit: NP-complete not NP-hard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of an aside as this doc is about the complexities of installing particular PyTorch versions, but will say that uv is way faster at installing PyTorch than pip.We run internal benchmarks of our custom container image builder and in the 'install torch' benchmark the p50 time saved when using `uv` is 25 seconds! (71.4s vs. 43.74s)---Aside 2: Seems there's a missing "involves" in this sentence:  "As such, installing PyTorch typically often configuring a project to use the PyTorch index."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;uv significantly speeds up my pytorch in docker builds  # Setup virtual env
  ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/app/.venv
  ENV PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
  RUN python3 -m venv $VIRTUAL_ENV
  RUN . $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate

  # install using uv
  RUN pip install uv
  RUN uv pip install torch==${TORCH_VERSION} --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

The index-url makes it really convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42188555</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about ex-library books, highlighting their characteristics and the benefits of purchasing them. Ex-library books are typically marked with library stamps or labels but are often sold at discounted prices. The site discusses the reasons for buying these books, such as affordability and unique finds, and offers tips for collectors and readers interested in acquiring them. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding their condition and how to assess their value before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I primarily read theology, and lots of early-to-mid-20th century Anglican theology. So, many of the books I read are out of print—and thus only available used. I’ve found that reading in a niche area tends to put some interesting copies in my lap. I have quite a few copies around that previously belonged to “famous” (at least within my little world) theologians. Many of these other copies are often ex-library, often from seminary or monastic libraries. It’s always interesting to see what libraries are getting rid of and to think about the monks or nuns who sat around reading them. (Or not, as the case may be—they were withdrawn, after all.)My favorite is a copy of Martin Thornton’s The Function of Theology, which had been deaccessioned from the library of the Seminary of the Southwest at some point. I happened to flip to the back to glance at the loan card. It had been borrowed precisely one time—October 23, 1987—but it had been borrowed that one time by a priest who became a friend of mine in 2021 during a course at a different institution. The small world of Anglican theology! I texted him a picture of the book, and he still remembered checking it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to hang out at used bookstores regularly. Mostly to find cheap but good quality books for my kids when they were younger. I once managed to get a used copy of Paul Graham's On Lisp which was discarded from the technical library of a company somewhere.The main point of interest is that physical items age and retain artifacts of their lives. I found a childrens book that was discarded from an American library where a girl had scrawled in pencil that she was proud that she finished it. I've seen one which was awarded to a man for being top of his class in college in the early 1900s. The bookshop I used to visit once had a book sold to him which contained a letter from Rabindrnath Tagore in the original in between the leaves of the book.It's a fascinating feeling and quite primal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I opened a bookshop after a long run in tech to try to slow down, and one of the pleasant surprises was the joy in accepting used book donations. I re-donate most of them, but have found some wonderful bookmarks and inscriptions in many. The words matter most, of course, but the tangible evidence of people decades or centuries ago is something that speaks to me profoundly. One inscription in a tiny book of prayers mentioned a friend passing it on after it had been placed under her deceased infant sister's chin, which was both morbid and moving. Autographs of spooks like J. Edgar Hoover conjure up other feelings. One other comment: the very old books will probably be around for a few centuries more after the newer ones have turned to dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42192336</guid></item><item><title>19.

Maybe long ago. Still there should be some form of moderation penalizing these shill posts that only glorify AI as being the future, ... the same way that not everything about crypto or the blockchain ended up on the FP. Seems with AI we're looking the other way and are OK with it?Or maybe it's me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1980s AI "boom" was tiny.In the 1980s, AI was a few people at Stanford, a few people at CMU, a few people at MIT, and a scattering of people elsewhere. There were maybe a half dozen startups and none of them got very big.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Artificial life fizzled as a meta disciplineI've wondered for a while if Artificial Life is in its own winter, waiting for someone to apply the lessons of scale we learned from neural nets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42196037</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority aimed at making it easier for website owners to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates to secure their sites. Announced in November 2014, it is driven by the need for widespread encryption on the web. The initiative is supported by multiple organizations and aims to reduce the complexities and costs associated with traditional certificate issuance, thereby promoting a safer, more secure internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "Zed Decoded: Rope Optimizations - Part 1" delves into the optimization techniques used in the Zed editor's rope data structure. It discusses the challenges faced in managing large texts efficiently and how ropes, which allow for better performance when handling string manipulations, are implemented. The author explains various strategies to enhance performance, such as minimizing memory usage and speeding up operations like slicing and concatenation. This piece serves as an introduction to the intricacies of rope-based optimizations, promising further insights in subsequent parts of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like all the blog posts and videos the Zed team has put out, thank you if you’re reading this!Unrelated to this specific post I’m such a fan of Zed. It’s the first feature complete text editor in recent memory that I’ve truly enjoyed using (i.e. it stays out of the way, is really fast, feels well engineered). I’m coming to Zed after years of Emacs which I still have love for but no longer feels like a competitive piece of software (it does not take full advantage of how good computers are today, e.g. gpu rendering or multicore). I really hope Zed stays a fast and lightweight text editor instead of becoming some bloated growth-at-all-cost VC ware (not that they’ve exhibited any signs of that happening). I’d also happily pay for Zed without a subscription based thing for access to LLM features (which I do not use).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really want to admire the Zed folks even though they are a new faction in the editor wars where I’m an emacs guy: they take mostly all the things I care about seriously.The are serious about local vs. remote vs. shared. They are serious about hardware acceleration because they care about users who type fast and edit big files. They care about real computer science on how to push the current hardware to serve the user, rather than treating the hardware as a crutch to give the user a slightly worse experience at a fraction of the development cost. They care about code highlighting the snippets on their blog like very similar to the default Zed theme.These are cool, serious people. If they give me emacs key bindings with full paredit-everywhere, I might switch my daily driver.And this is about using modern SIMD-style stuff, branch less stuff, Lemire stuff in a modern and relevant context. Other commenters have pointed out that you can do the mask or popcount better with intrinsically, and yeah, but they probably know that, and B. They got the massive win, the remaining factor of K on the pop count is coming.Long Zed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all really cool, but I just want soft wrap to be fixed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174085</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Google is implementing a stricter approach to combat "parasite SEO," a tactic where low-quality sites adopt established brands' reviews and content to boost their rankings. This initiative aims to protect legitimate publishers from being outperformed by sites that imitate their content without adding value. As a result, reputable publishers may face penalties or reduced visibility if they do not adjust their SEO practices. The changes highlight Google’s ongoing effort to improve search quality and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused about how or why this is a new policy. My memory is inside Google we were discussing this risk back in 2003, probably earlier. Search quality was on it. I just assumed they'd lost the arms race, or that the parasites' ranking was justified for other reasons that were hard to tease apart. What are they doing new now?I think often about Mahalo, the sleazy shovel content that was spamming the web back in 2007. Google shut that down somewhat fast, although it did take several years. These days with AI and more aggressive spammers it's a losing battle. The real problem is the financial incentives that make this kind of spamming profitable in the first place.My tiny little blog gets about 3 requests a week for someone to "pay me to run a guest article". Going rate is $50-$200 and again, my blog is tiny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's hilarious is when people boast about being "in Forbes" like it's the magazine from 20 years ago, and not this parasitic SEO operation that publishes garbage on anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully this is a step in the right direction. Google's search results have gotten so bad - seems like even some of the simplest searches are just packed with AI generated and SEO garbage. I don't even want SearchGPT do take over the search market space because I'm almost sure it will still be garbage. Just bring back the google from 5-10 years ago please :(.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42198115</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really exciting to see this approach to automation and intent specification! We’ve been working with similar challenges at Origins AI, where we focus on deep tech solutions.I can’t overstate how much having a robust system for breaking down tasks and iterating on them has helped us.For one of our recent projects, we had to integrate complex workflows with third-party systems, and it was clear that reliability came down to how well we could define and refine intent over time.I’m especially curious about your self-healing automations. That’s an area where we’ve found a lot of value using models that can adapt to subtle UI changes, but it’s always a tradeoff with latency. Would love to hear more about how you balance that in production!Looking forward to trying Autotab and seeing how it compares with some of the internal tools we’ve built!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been working in this space for almost 9 years and written a lot of scrappers and web automations for various clients, I am really excited to build something like this too. Are you guys hiring? Would love to chat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As it runs, Autotab asks for clarifications and feedback. These learnings are accumulated into action memory—improving Autotab's world model, and allowing it to work reliably for hours on end.Is "learning", used as a noun, a term of art in this field?If not, my reactioning to that using is that it is a being bad English that causes producings of gratings on the ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42197741</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Meta utilizes large language models (LLMs) to enhance its incident response processes. It describes the integration of LLMs in various stages of incident management, including detection, analysis, and resolution, enabling faster and more efficient handling of issues. The use of LLMs helps in automating responses, improving communication among teams, and providing insightful recommendations based on past incidents. Overall, the implementation of LLMs is portrayed as a significant step toward optimizing Meta's operational efficiency and responsiveness in crisis situations.&lt;/p&gt;

I unfortunately roped in one non-responsible team's oncall who was making dinner at home, but thankfully, he did know what team to reach out to, based on the description of the problem.Would be nice if there was better tooling for going from observed problem to responsible team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So if you look at the flip side, the on call engineer is being misled by AI ~60% of the time.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could potentially build on stable Rust by emitting the breakpoint instructions yourself, at least on popular platforms. For instance, `core::arch::asm!("int3")` on x86, or `core::arch::asm!("brk #1")` on ARM.Also, this is providing motivation to want to stabilize a breakpoint mechanism, perhaps `core::arch::breakpoint()`. I'm going to propose an API Change Proposal (ACP) to the libs-api team to see if we can provide that in stable Rust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rusts current pretty printers in lldb and gdb are just not good enough for a fluid step debugging experience. I've had luck with intellij IDE's but it's very sad that the best we can do in a language with such good devex tooling is print debugging.Theoretically you could generate debug scripts with a macro and embed them with  #![debugger_visualizer(gdb_script_file = "../foo.py")]

but I haven't seen anyone go through the trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find myself using debug_here (https://github.com/ethanpailes/debug-here) which does similar things but for desktop-class debugging. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it still works for me on Windows at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42193793</guid></item><item><title>29.

It has not just S-expression syntax but recursion, setq, dynamic typing, quoting of S-expressions and thus lists and homoiconicity, cons, car, cdr, let*, cond, progn, runtime code evaluation, serialization (though bread/bwrite rather than read/print), and readmacros. Its object system is based on CLOS.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28728302&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes me curious what state R was at the time, or whatever else could've been useful for deep learning, and the benefits of a new language vs adapting something that exists.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the resilience of internet networks in the context of recent cable cuts in the Baltic Sea, exploring whether the internet can effectively reroute traffic to maintain connectivity. It discusses the mechanisms of internet routing, the impact of such damages on network performance, and highlights the complexity involved in the routing processes that are meant to provide redundancy and minimize disruptions. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these technical aspects to assess the overall robustness of global internet infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the original adage from John Gilmore ("The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it") was referring to a behavior of Usenet rather than of the Internet. In particular, if articles didn't reach a node by one path, the node would still accept that they were missing (according to Usenet routing rules) and accept those articles from a different path. Thus, one could not prevent Usenet messages or newsgroups from reaching most of Usenet merely by deleting or not forwarding them on a single node. Another way of putting this is that the connectivity of Usenet was (in general though not everywhere) a web rather than a tree, and the Usenet software didn't assume that messages had to be forwarded along some particular path, if another path was available.As with Jon Postel's maxim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) people have also subsequently applied this to human behavior, not just the behavior of particular software.There were ultimately more technically sophisticated means of censorship available on Usenet that were somewhat more effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have workloads on hetzner data centers in Finnland and Germany. Hetzner owns part of that cable, to connect those sites.Tracerout gives me a path like this
 spine5.cloud2.fsn1.hetzner.com                        
-&gt;
core22.fsn1.hetzner.com                               
-&gt;
 core5.fra.hetzner.com                                
-&gt;
core53.sto.hetzner.com                               -&gt;
core31.hel1.hetzner.comWhich is worse than before, but still works for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it was late 2012 or early 2013 when I was in India (Hyderabad) at a time when an earthquake in the Mediterranean Sea cut I think it was SEA-WE-ME 3. The internet was terrible for the next two weeks, until the cable was repaired: almost half the internet flat-out didn’t work, including most USA hosts. I have no idea why communication between India and the USA, which should head east, was affected by a break to the west in the Mediterranean. I do know that local ISPs often have fairly dodgy peering arrangements.My workaround was to tunnel via my own VPS in Singapore, as I could connect to it and  but I was using OpenVPN back then and performance was pretty terrible. (Now if I want such tunnelling I use WireGuard, and it’s much better.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42196794</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The researchers analyzed US-flagged ships less than 1,000 gross tonnage, which includes primarily passenger ships and three types of tugboats.This is the buried lede. They are excluding basically all cargo shipping.- Very little of the shipping industry is US-flagged. Most commercial ships sail under flags of convenience such as Panama and Libera, because of their reduced regulations and costs.- Nobody carries cargo any distance in vessels of less than 1000 gross tons, because that scale would be uneconomical to operate. Modern seagoing cargo ships have about one crew member per 8000 tons of cargo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Lithium fire battery in a cruise ship in the middle of the Pacific would be a truly unique experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, this is a really good paper.  Supplementary info is really great too- they get into details down to floating charging port stations as part of the infrastructure.  Surprising how much demand is from tugboats.  I have questions about how you'd safely hook up 5 MW connections, but it's definitely solvable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42195817</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the differences between nominal and structural typing in programming, particularly within TypeScript. It explains that nominal typing focuses on the name or identity of the types, while structural typing emphasizes the shape or structure of data. The author highlights scenarios where each type system is beneficial, outlining how nominal typing can enforce stricter type constraints and improve code maintainability. Conversely, structural typing allows for greater flexibility and easier integration of types. The piece provides insights into when to use each approach for effective type handling in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190418"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What this means is that all nominal variants and records are really just nominal wrappers over structural variants or records.If you have both nominal types and structural types in your language, you can already do this, while keeping the ability to be nominal only or structural only when you want.In the following OCaml code variant inference in pattern matching is not automatic (although the compiler will warn you about the missing cases, which helps you figuring what to write), but the types do get refined in the corresponding branch.    type 'a tree =
      Tree of
        [ `Empty
        | `Branch of ('a tree * 'a * 'a tree)
          (* Unfortunately, inline records are not supported here,
             so you have to use tuples, objects, or a mutually recursive record
             type. *)
        ]
      [@@unboxed]

    (* You can give aliases to subsets of constructors *)
    type 'a branch =
      [ `Branch of ('a tree * 'a * 'a tree) ]
    
    let f (x : 'a branch) = ()
    
    let f x =
      match x with
      | Tree `Empty -&gt; ()
      (* You need to be explicit about the cases you want to handle. This pattern
         could also be written `Tree (#branch as rest)`. *)
      | Tree (`Branch _ as rest) -&gt; f rest

The one feature I'd really like in this space would be the ability to refer to a subset of the constructors of a nominal types as if it was a (restricted) polymorphic variant that could only be recombined with another subset of constructors of the same nominal type. It would allow some of the power of polymorphic variants without losing the efficient representation allowed by nominal types knowing the possible variants ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nominal vs structural distinction (in both programming and math) goes beyond types. Should names in programs matter?Consider two functions, say copySurname and copyStreetName. They do same exact thing, but in different context. No sane person would call copySurname for the street, even though the function is the same.So there is this tension, should name of the function (or of the type) only reflect it's internal structure (structuralism), or should it also reflect the intended domain application (nominalism)?There is a formalism school of mathematics that is pretty much the hardcore structuralist, i.e. names of the objects don't matter, only their relationships. But most mathematicians (and all programmers) reject that view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think is forgotten here that one of the benefits of nominal typing is that the compiler can know that data layout at run time so performance benefits.There has been so much ink spilled on the question of what kind of type systems help programmers be productive but there is not such controversy on the performance side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190418</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are remodeling your home, strongly suggest using Bonsai (previously Blender BIM) add-on to model and plan.In addition to getting my layout just right down to the ft, and using current materials (ie, hardwood, cabinet placement). I modeled out HVAC ducts and overall system.I had planned on doing major renovations (including plumbing, electric, networking) and would have modeled those as well since the walls would be exposed. But ultimately, due to changing political atmosphere, decided to put these on hold.It does have a learning curve but would have been made collaboration with at architects much easier (exchanging ifc files).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blender, in my view, is one of the best arguments to develop native desktop applications over web view wrappers like Electron. Everything is responsive and instant, you can open new 3D view windows by just sliding them open at 60 frames a second, performance is stable even with multiple windows open and the download size is a reasonable 334MB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blender really is a gem, for beginners there really is little reason to learn anything else, fully featured, free and runs off a USB or shared drive, can run on pretty old hardware.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current trajectory is that SpaceX proved the commercial and military viability of an LEO megaconstellation, repeatedly lowering their target altitudes and raising their satellite count because of debris and cell size concerns...And now the rest of the world is trying to catch up in a sort of arms race, and not taking any care about debris concerns.  The most tempting orbits are the ones in upper LEO that permit them to launch fewer satellites.SpaceX are going to end up well under 500km (orbital lifespan: a decade) before things are finished, and they switched to very low orbit staging with SEP spiral out to reach final orbit a ways back.China's newest constellation Thousand Sails is at an altitude of 800km (orbital lifespan: thousands of years), with a thousand satellites in the works over the next year or so and 14,000 planned, and they're launching them using chemical upper stages designed to explode into a thousand pieces at the target altitude.  This is sufficient for Kessler Syndrome all on its own, without counting interactions with anything else up there.  A catastropic debris cascade at 800km  percolates down to lower altitudes over time and impacts.We need viable treaties limiting development beyond 400 or 500km and we need them ten years ago.I don't know how to sell the urgency of this predicament.  You can have as many satellites as you want, a million uncoordinated bodies, at 400km because direct collision potential scales with (satellite count / orbital lifespan) ^2 .   At 1000km, satellites decay so slowly we are already too crowded;  we have already overused the space.  We are speed-running the end of the space age and we are doing it to save a small number of dollars and to avoid a small amount of diplomacy.This is not something we get a do-over on.  There is no practical way to collect ton-scale debris at present, no way to track kilogram-scale debris, no practical way to shield pressure vessels against gram-scale debris, and even milligram-scale debris can hit with the force of a bullet.  After collisions start occurring at a rapid clip, the mass of potential impactors quickly forms a long tailed lognormal distribution that denies us space for centuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper in question is here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40295-024-00458-3It adds to a pretty large body of literature around this subject, the gist of which is "risk is going up, but we don't really have a good way of estimating what that means in terms of actual collision rates".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As long as it is militarily and commercially viable then the number of satellites will continue increasing, regardless of what academics have to say about collision rates. As per usual this is a coordination problem and in case people have not noticed nations are becoming less coordinated and more insular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42197824</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article reviews "The Political Afterlife of Paradise Lost," a book by Orlando Reade that explores the enduring influence of John Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost" on political thought and discourse. Reade examines how Milton's themes continue to resonate in contemporary politics, addressing issues such as power, oppression, and liberation. The review emphasizes the book's relevance, offering insights into the complex relationship between literature and political ideologies, and highlights Reade's scholarly approach to engaging with Milton's legacy in modern contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone is interested, the full text of Paradise Lost with helpful annotations is available online at Dartmouth:https://milton.host.dartmouth.edu/reading_room/pl/intro/text...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The book being reviewed by TFA is not itself a review of Paradise Lost, but a study of how people have interpreted Paradise Lost since it was published in 1667. TFA says 'The biggest story that Reade is telling is that of slavery.'YMMV, but I don't think that this was Milton's main message - IIRC from reading PL years ago at school, the main story was Satan's rebellion against God. Satan was presented as a sort of heroic anti-hero, who has some great lines, although he eventually (of course) loses. So, I guess I'm saying please don't let this review of a book that highlights lots of peoples' reactions to PL influence your judgement of the underlying source text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found the first 20% of this book a bit tedious as I got used to the style of English, but I'm glad I stuck it out. Eventually it became very natural to read and the beauty of the language is something I'm not sure I've encountered anywhere else.At least through a contemporary lens I didn't get the impression it was political whatsoever. What it did seem to do was fill in the (many) blanks present in the corresponding biblical narratives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42188816</guid></item><item><title>38.

And the URL remapping API was inspired by Sinatra, another web framework of Ruby.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a number of brass instruments that are nickel plated. Nickel plating is great because it doesn’t tarnish and it doesn’t tend to corrode, so it always looks shiny. It was super popular until about 50 years ago. A few players are allergic to it, which is probably why it’s been replaced by silver plating over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do this a bunch at home, my setup has also migrated to work. Simple solution made with vinegar, salt and sodium laurel sulphate, then a couple of cheap nickel electrodes. Run current through both to make the nickel acetate, then you're good to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This handbook is thorough, but not of much use to any novice just looking to do some nickel plating. It's not hard to do though, and certainly something you can do at home. I've done this for a set of custom steel brackets I needed for some project¹.This Youtube video is useful if you want to start from scratch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-PtnwtOR241: I could have used stainless steel instead, but bending, drilling, and tapping stainless steel is a lot harder than doing this with regular steel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190199</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find a lot of 10 year old Dell PowerEdge servers for basically free these days, some loaded with 128gb+ RAM. They work perfectly well with TrueNAS, pfSense, or even more powerful stuff. If you dont need a thousand cores, I always suggest them to people. Otherwise they end up in the dump..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one downside I've found (other than noise) running a super old supermicro at home is the power consumption is nowhere near as good as the modern hardware. But my server is _really_ old, some dual socket xeon thing I got super cheap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a rack in a datacenter with mostly 5 year old Supermicro servers. We bought them all off of Ebay for no more than $400 each. They work great and we have more compute and bandwidth for our workloads for less than $1000 a month. If we used one of the could providers it would be many thousands of dollars per month. I understand not everyone has the skills to run their own rack but the value of doing so is totally worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145975</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses advancements in machine learning, specifically focusing on improving the robustness and performance of algorithms in uncertain environments. It explores the interplay between model complexity and data efficiency, highlighting various techniques to enhance generalization. The authors present new theoretical insights and empirical results, demonstrating how these approaches can lead to more reliable and effective machine learning models in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's for visualizing datasets where fine-grained cluster details and broader relationships matter. There are example renderings in the paper.From the README:&gt; PaCMAP (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation) is a dimensionality reduction method that can be used for visualization, preserving both local and global structure of the data in original space. PaCMAP optimizes the low dimensional embedding using three kinds of pairs of points: neighbor pairs (pair_neighbors), mid-near pair (pair_MN), and further pairs (pair_FP).&gt; Previous dimensionality reduction techniques focus on either local structure (e.g. t-SNE, LargeVis and UMAP) or global structure (e.g. TriMAP), but not both, although with carefully tuning the parameter in their algorithms that controls the balance between global and local structure, which mainly adjusts the number of considered neighbors. Instead of considering more neighbors to attract for preserving glocal structure, PaCMAP dynamically uses a special group of pairs -- mid-near pairs, to first capture global structure and then refine local structure, which both preserve global and local structure. For a thorough background and discussion on this work, please read our paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool paper, code in the repo looks good and easy to use as well. After a quick skim of the paper, I feel like it suffers from a pretty common flaw (one which my PI often points out to me in my work, so I guess I’m just extra attuned to it right now): the authors make a pretty convincing argument (to me at least, but I’m more of an applied ML than theoretical ML person, so grain of salt) from a mathematical/methodological perspective that PaCMAP is better than common popular DR algorithms, and has various desirable properties in terms of simultaneous global/local scale preservation etc, but they more or less accept it as a given that we need better DR algorithms and that being better than the existing methods makes the work interesting, while failing to really convincingly illustrate actual use-cases where PaCMAP unlocks some sort of insight or delivers some sort of meaningful result that t-SNE and friends could not do.I think doing so would be especially important in a paper on DR techniques which are already so fraught in how they are deployed (often with little thought) in many applied contexts, and when so much of their putative utility comes from their interaction with human visual perception. I would have loved to see some discussion of actual engineering use cases where PaCMAP proves more useful than t-SNE - I’m sure there are many! Really just nitpicking from me though, will probably try it out on my own cases in the next few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42189253</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those curious, here is prior art from 12 years ago, capturing light in a coke bottle with a single streak camera.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtsXgODHMWkhttps://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/trillionfps/I remember when this dropped and where I was when I watched it and read the paper. One of the coolest things I'd ever seen.This seems like a great extension of the work. I'm okay with trading accuracy for crude usefulness as a model. Making this interactive and putting it in the hands of curious minds is the next step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the raw footage the wavefront will almost always appear to move from the closer points to the further points simply because it takes time to propagate, and we see that in their example here. This is now somewhat misleading, as they're synthetically moving the camera in post (but not the pulse propagation). I point this out because the team have also developed an "unwarping" technique to cancel it out, and they demonstrate it at the bottom of their website. Note how the scattered light now propagates outward intuitively.https://anaghmalik.com/FlyingWithPhotons/https://anaghmalik.com/FlyingWithPhotons/media/moving_videos...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06493 is the paper. If I'm understanding it correctly, the camera isn't actually capturing a pulse of light. Instead, it's recording single pixels from a 10MHz series of pulses using a single pixel camera that rotates around the object. Then uses this time-series of data to render a video of a "single" virtual pulse via a NeRF.The "AI" in the title appears to be click bait since the paper doesn't mention AI, and a NeRF isn't really AI in the colloquial sense even though it uses a DNN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42193663</guid></item><item><title>45.

It's like you could go dig up an archived Twitter dev post from 2008, find and replace and post.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the relevance of the traditional 80-character line limit in coding and text formatting, originally established due to the constraints of early computer screens and printers. The author examines how modern technology, including larger screens and more flexible formatting options, raises the question of whether this limit is still necessary. While acknowledging the historical significance and benefits of keeping lines within this limit for readability and maintainability, the author ultimately concludes that the rule is becoming less critical in contemporary programming and writing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just because some people like to have a single pane of text cover their entire 16:9 display doesn’t mean I should have to.  I find very vertical text much easier to follow.  Wide lines are usually wide due to nesting and chaining, either of blocks or of inline expressions.  Both are a thing which should not be.Concisely and clearly define one concept or abstraction.  Then, use it in the next definition.  This isn’t hard!  And stop with the insanity-inducing compound names.  If your name needs 5 subclauses to clarify its intent, your semantics are stupid and you should be beaten with a shoe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One minor advantage which wasn’t so relevant in 2008: 80 character lines are much easier to read  on a smartphone. This is especially true for Safari on iOS, which always seems to make bad wrapping / sizing decisions with plain text.ETA: thinking back on it, several years ago I switched from 120 characters to 80 specifically because of this. I don’t have a car, so I read a lot of code on my phone while taking public transit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sticking with 80 characters has been great for my team. Not only does it encourage shorter lines, but comparing diffs on GitHub ensures that both old and new comparisons fit evenly on the page without any cutoffs or wrapping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42116051</guid></item><item><title>47.

The effectiveness of organizations, including the ability to act ethically, will be seriously degraded.There needs to be some kind of work product doctrine, which protects the privacy of routine business communication. Defining that, while allowing the collection of evidence of criminal activity, won't be easy, but the current state of affairs is unworkable.I don't wish to facilitate corporate crime, and it's obvious that some of Google's anti-competitive behavior is unlawful. But, I don't see any realistic alternative to what Google is doing in the current legal environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These policies are in place because companies have learned that journalists will happily take any comment, from any employee, from any context, and make it Crucial Evidence(TM) of impropriety...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; put “attorney-client privileged” on documents and to always add a Google lawyer to the list of recipients, even if no legal questions were involved and the lawyer never respondedWow. One of the very first things I learned when onboarding to a US company is that the client-attorney privilege does not work like that at all.“Privileged and confidential” is not a legal shibboleth (especially not when used so incorrectly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42192972</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Using a full-featured RPC framework for IPC seems like overkill when the processes run on the same machine.That is exactly what COM/WinRT, XPC, Android Binder, D-BUS are.Naturally they have several optimisations for local execution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I loved about Fuchsia was its IPC interface, using FIDL which is like a more optimized version of protobufs.https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had to reach for a new IPC mechanism recently to implement a multi-GPU LLM inference server.My original implementation just pinned one GPU to its own thread then used message passing between them in the same process but Nvidia's NCCL library hates this for reasons I haven't fully figured out yet.I considered gRPC for IPC since I was already using it for the server's API but dismissed it because it was an order of magnitude slower and I didn't want to drag async into the child PIDs.Serializing the tensors between processes and using the Servo team's ipc-channel crate[0] has worked surprisingly well. If you're using Rust and need a drop-in (ish) replacement for the standard library's channels, give it a shot.[0] https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42193859</guid></item><item><title>49.

If I don't follow someone, I only want to see their posts if they were knowingly reposted by someone who I do follow. If I want some posts filtered from my feed, I'll set up word filters myself, thank you very much.It's a recurring theme in the modern IT industry that "the average user" can't be trusted to take their own responsibility. It's sometimes taken as an indisputable truth, even. Why does this keep happening? What can I do to put an end to this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a starter pack that focused on NLP/LLM academics and researchers in industry that tend to publish and talk about their work on Twitter, but have moved to BlueSky. It really does feel like a breath of fresh air. It's the content I want to casually browse when I'm on the subway or the ferry with a lot less rage baiting and without bots and spam.Plus, it has that nice chronological feature in the default algorithm that really focuses on recent news, which was always my issue with Threads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this will become true; it's the reason I made an account as soon as possible (not the one that matches my name), have followed hashtag-based feeds with mixed success, and donated to my favourite client (tokimeki.blue). I want to follow topics, in the fashion of Usenet or Reddit, not people. If I'm interested in dandelions, I want to read Jay Expert's posts about dandelions, not their posts about their breakfast (unless it's dandelions) or favourite TV show (unless it's about dandelions).I fear the recent US election is going to kill it, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42193549</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't really followed Next.js and the related ecosystem closely, what does this project do exactly? If I look at Next.js docs [0], they have three options for self-hosting: using a Node server, using a Docker container or as an SPA. Is this project a wrapper around one of those or is it something else entirely? Or to perhaps ask differently, to me it seems you can already self-host Next.js, what's the value add of this specific project?[0] https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/depl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure why this is posted as a Show HN. This project has been around for a long time and I don’t think OP is related in any way to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been surprised by the number of companies adopting nextjs as their defacto framework without concern for the uncomfortable reality that the framework is built to be hosted on vercel with self hosting largely supported as an afterthought.
It's great that opennext exists, but it really shouldn't _have_ to exist (as I believe some of the maintainers have publicly stated)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42198611</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nature of mathematical thinking and challenges common perceptions about how people engage with mathematics. It emphasizes that mathematical thinking is not solely about performing calculations or solving problems but also involves conceptual understanding, creativity, and intuition. The piece highlights that this kind of thinking is often misrepresented in educational settings and suggests that nurturing a deeper appreciation for the abstract reasoning behind mathematics may lead to a more profound understanding of the subject. It encourages a broader and more flexible view of what it means to think mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been reading the author's book, Mathematica, and it's awesome. The title of this post doesn't do it justice.He shows that math skill is almost more like a sports talent than it is knowledge talent. He claims this based on the way people have to learn how to manipulate different math objects in their heads, whether treating them as rotated shapes, slot machines, or origami. It's like an imagination sport.Also, he inspired me to relearn a lot of fundamental math on MathAcademy.com which has been super fun and stressful. I feel like I have the tetris effect but with polynomials now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with the sentiment of this. I think our obsession with innate mathematical skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things.I've been working a lot on my math skills lately (as an adult). A mindset I've had in the past is that "if it's hard, then that means you've hit your ceiling and you're wasting your time." But really, the opposite is true. If it's easy, then it means you already know this material, and you're wasting your time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To my mind, the premature formalization of the math is the principal contributor to gas lighting and alienation of people from maths. The reduction of concepts to symbols and manipulation thereof, is an afterthought. It's misguided for them to be introduced to people right at the outset.People need to speak in plain English [0]. To some mathematicians' assertion that English is not precise enough, I say, take a hike. One need to walk before they can run.Motivating examples need to precede mathematical methods; formulae and proofs ought to be reserved for the appendix, not page 1.[0] I mean natural language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200209</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores Hyrum's Law in the context of the Go programming language (Golang), which posits that as software evolves, any behavior that users depend on will become a part of the software's interface, intentionally or not. It discusses the implications of this law for Go developers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining backward compatibility and the challenges posed by changes in behavior that could affect existing codebases. The piece highlights the necessity for careful consideration of design decisions and how they may impact users over time, advocating for best practices that minimize unexpected changes in software behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hyrum's Law is one of those observations that's certainly useful, but be careful not to fixate on it and draw the wrong conclusions. Consider that even the total runtime of a function is an observable property, which means that optimizing a function to make it faster is a breaking change (what if suddenly one of your queues clears too fast and triggers a deadlock??), despite the fact that 99.99999999% of your users would probably appreciate having code that runs faster for no effort on their part.Therefore it's unavoidable that what constitutes a "breaking change" is a social contract, not a technical contract, because the alternative is that literally nothing is ever allowed to change. So as a library author, document what parts of your API are guaranteed not to change, be reasonable, and have empathy for your users. And as a library consumer, understand that making undocumented interfaces into load-bearing constructs is done at your own risk, and have empathy for the library authors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hah, I wrote the crypto/rsa comments. We take Hyrum's Law (and backwards compatibility [1]) extremely seriously in Go. Here are a couple more examples:- We randomly read an extra byte from random streams in various GenerateKey functions (which are not marked like the ones in OP) with MaybeReadByte [2] to avoid having our algorithm locked in- Just yesterday someone reported that a private ECDSA key with a nil public key used to work, and now it doesn't, so we probably have to make it work again [3]- Iterating over a map uses a randomized order to avoid exposing the internals- The output of rand.Rand is considered part of the compatibility promise, so we had to go to great lengths to improve it [4]- We discuss all the time what commitments to make in docs and what behaviors to disclaim, knowing we can never change something documented and probably something that's not explicitly documented as "this may change" [6][1]: https://go.dev/doc/go1compat[2]: https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/internal/randutil#MaybeReadByte[3]: https://go.dev/issue/70468[4]: https://go.dev/blog/randv2[5]: https://go.dev/blog/chacha8rand[6]: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/598336/comment/5d6...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solution to the specifically mentioned problem: Don't use string-based errors, use sentinel errors [1].More generally: Don't produce code where consumers of your API are the least bit inclined to rely on non-technical strings. Instead use first-level language constructs like predefined error values, types or even constants that contain the non-technical string so that API consumers can compare the return value againnst the constant instead of hard-coding the contained string themselves.Hyrum's Law is definitely a thing, but its effects can be mitigated.[1]: https://thomas-guettler.de/go/wrapping-and-sentinel-errors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42201892</guid></item><item><title>3.

I built a similar tool as an experiment while at Recurse: https://github.com/zephraph/webview. Didn’t really do any heavy lifting though, just reused some of Tauri’s crates. Does Bun run on the same process as the GUI binding? OSX steals the main thread when rendering a native window which made me lean towards separating the processes. Still wonder if there’s a better way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential but I hadn't heard of Bun before and their performance claims had me interested, sadly seems you just can't beat V8 in the real world. I threw some poorly optimized art code I wrote yesterday at it and it's almost 2x as slow as when I run the same code in node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42199486</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This gives me an idea. We have a very large compost pile from mucking out various horse stalls and pens. It's mainly composed of urine-soaked woodchips and mostly broken-down horse manure. There's also some dirt in there as well. As an experiment this summer, I tried growing potatoes and carrots in it. Potatoes did extremely well, the carrots not so much (but I attribute that to poor watering).It would be interesting to monitor the temperature to see how active it still is, since I can tell that it's not completely broken down yet. I actually have an ESP8266-based temperature sensor around here that I was using to track ambient temp for another fermentation project.Now I'm thinking of encapsulating its thermistor and putting the 8266 in an IP67 enclosure along with a solar cell and just planting the whole lot on top of the compost pile. It already serves a web page on a .local  domain so there would be minimal work required on my part.I might actually get to that this weekend!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not wanting to minimise your product, it's not something I personally would need. But I'm curious if you looked at what scale of composting would be needed for electronic monitoring to improve the final product enough to pay off the investment? It feels like it would have to be very large scale?I like the mushroom vibe on your domestic design, it feels like you could have leant into that a bit more even. Cool beans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi!Which manufacturer/model sensors are you using? I have made some environmental monitoring with very cheap sensors for some hobby projects, but have very bad experience on repeatability of the sensor reading, or for CO2 sensors even noise tolerance (was also dicussed on HN, that discussion made me realize that noise is the cause of the problems, and have managed to verify that).I have some project ideas beyond my at-home breadboard prototyping but to go beyond I'd rather build on reliable components as the software/infra side is maturing now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200099</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(before you jump into discussion, remember that this only about these two individuals)ICC and the prosecutor are on very solid ground here.The prosecutor asked opinions from a impartial panel of experts in international law. The panel included people like Theodor Meron (former Legal adviser for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs),  Helene Kennedy, Adrian Fulford.Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant provided plenty of evidence of the intent. Did they really think that when they talk Hebrew to their audience, rest of the world does not hear them. Case like this would be harder to prosecute without evidence of intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For context, this is only possible because the state of Palestine pushed hard and persisted for years to become an ICC member and thus give the ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed on Palestinian territory, whether by Israel or by Palestinian factions. The USA is still mad at them for doing it.The full account is worth reading, it includes considerations by the various resistance factions that they’d also be subject to ICC jurisdiction and realized threats of punitive measures by the USA and Israel if they continued to push for ICC membership: https://palepedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court%27s_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The Chamber therefore found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant bear criminal responsibility for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare."Whats perhaps interesting to note is that this charge was made for "just" 41 [1] confirmed starvation deaths among a population of 2,141,643 people [2].Of course every death caused by intentional starvation is a severe crime and must be punished, but in the context of the victim numbers that most past crimes against humanity have had, it sets a relatively low new bar.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip_famine[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42203543</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study has shown that a weight-loss drug, originally developed for obesity treatment, effectively reduces the size of heart muscle in patients with obesity and diabetes, potentially lowering the risk of heart failure. Conducted by researchers at the University of Alberta, the research emphasizes that this medication not only aids in weight loss but also has significant cardiac benefits. The findings suggest that incorporating this drug into treatment plans for patients with obesity-related heart issues could improve overall heart health and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always so baffled by warnings about losing muscle when losing weight.Of course you do! If your body is tens of pounds lighter, then you don't need the extra muscle to lug it around. This paper is about reduction in heart muscle, and of course your heart doesn't need to be as strong because there's less blood to pump and less tissue to fuel.When you gain weight, you also increase the muscles needed to carry that weight around. If you see someone obese at the gym doing the leg press, you may be astonished at how strong their legs are. When you lose weight, you don't need that muscle anymore.Our bodies are really good at providing exactly the amount of muscle we need for our daily activities (provided we eat properly, i.e. sufficient protein), so it's entirely natural that our muscles decrease as we lose weight, the same way they increased when we gain weight. Muscles are expensive to keep around when we don't need them.Obviously, if you exercise, then you'll keep the muscles you need for exercising.But this notion that weight loss can somehow be a negative because you'll lose muscle too, I don't know where it came from. Yes you can lose muscle, but you never would have had that muscle in the first place if you hadn't been overweight -- so it's not something to worry about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not commenting specifically on the heart-muscle aspect of the study, but it shouldn't be a surprise that the weight loss from this drug is significantly attributable to muscle loss; it almost always is when dieting. It's the same with  keto/low-carb or any other kind of caloric-restrictive dieting (which Ozempic facilitates).The modern weight-loss programs I'm seeing now (at least those aimed mostly at middle-aged men) emphasize consuming significant amounts of protein (2g for every 1kg of body weight each day) and engaging in regular resistance training, in order to maintain muscle mass.The article addresses this:To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs.Perhaps there needs to be more formal research into this, and a strong recommendation made to everyone using these drugs that this kind of diet and exercise plan is vital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of people here citing loss of muscle mass as a side effect of GLP-1s, when the reality is that weight loss almost always comes with muscle loss.For me, that hasn't even been the case. I'm down 40lbs on a relatively low dose of Semaglutide and my muscle mass has moderately increased over the last 6 months. The hysteria over this is totally unfounded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42199447</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;MIT has announced changes to its undergraduate tuition policy, aimed at reducing the financial burden on families with lower incomes. Starting in the 2024-2025 academic year, families earning less than $70,000 will see a significant reduction in tuition costs, with those earning under $140,000 paying a lower percentage. The initiative is part of MIT's broader efforts to promote access and affordability in education, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder talented students from pursuing their studies at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was touring colleges as a high school senior I met someone who had gotten into MIT but whose family could only afford to send one kid to an elite college, him or his sister. He decided to go to a state school which was a lot less expensive but whose academics weren't close to the same level. This stuff matters to people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I think this is well meaning, I’d be much more impressed by institutions actually cutting costs, The ratio of administrators to students is insane as is the faculty ratio at most universities, not to mention the outlays for extravagant projects like sports centers and student centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great step in the right direction. I can't speak directly for MIT, but there are issues with how these programs don't apply to parents with small family businesses. My parents had a small business, with my father taking home a salary of $XX,XXX. Duke University used the business assets to determine the EFC (expected family contribution) of literally 90% of the salary. Essentially saying to sell off the family business for the college fund, which was a non-starter.Small businesses are allegedly the backbone of America, and I feel these tuition support programs overlook this segment of the middle-class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42195895</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does "world" mean here? How does the spatiality fit into some latent space? Or what constitutes the "world"? 
If the answer is, there is none, the world is just frames of video and any consistency quickly blurs out after a few seconds. That's not a world generation, that's just generation of video frames following frames. Not that it isn't cool, but it has almost zero usability for generating a "world" simulation. The key to a realistic world is that you can reliably navigate it. Visit and revisit places. If you modify anything, those modifications are persisted. If you leave a room and re-enter it hours later, the base expectation is that the same objects are in that room.Wouldn't a working approach be to just create a really low resolution 3D world in the traditional "3D game world" sense to get the spatial consistency. Then this crude map with attributes is fed into frame generation to create the resulting world? It wouldn't be infinite, but on the other hand no one has a need for an infinite world either. A spherical world solves the border issue pretty handily. As I understood it, there was some element of that in the new FS2024 (discussed yesterday on HN).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm into VR and mixed reality, and I think this is headed to making the Holodeck real in an immersive way. That's the concept of the Matrix and what they are demoing, just in 2d.I am guessing the main thing holding this stuff back in terms of fidelity and consistency or generalization is just compute. But the new techniques they have here have just dramatically lowered the compute costs and increased the generalization.Maybe just something like the giant Cerebras SRAM chips will get to the next 10 X in scale that smooths this out and pushes it closer to Star Trek. Or maybe some new paradigm like memristors.But I'm looking forward to within just a few years being able to put on some fairly comfortable mixed reality glasses and just asking for whatever or whoever I want to appear in my home (for example) according to my whim.Or, train it on a lot of how-to videos such as cooking. It just materializes an example of someone showing you exactly what you need to do right in your kitchen.Here's another crazy idea: train on videos and interactions with productivity applications rather than games. In the future, for small businesses, we skip having the AI generate source code and just describe how the application works. The data and program state are just stored in a giant context window, and the application functionality changes the instant you make a request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the future I was trying to pitch in 2018 when we had built Ayvri and had every paraglider in the world, the world's largest ultramarathons, drone operators, and lots of other users of our real-world 3D environment.Though we were using map tiles at the time, we were developing a model that took photos and a GPS track to add information that better matched environmental conditions (cloud, better lighting, etc).People still ask me to open-source or give them our source code, but the code was acquired, so that isn't possible. But I do regularly say that if I were to rebuild Ayvri today, I'd do it as an interactive video rather than loading tiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42201117</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the cultural phenomenon surrounding the "Demon Core," a subcritical mass of plutonium involved in two criticality accidents in the 1940s. It examines how this historical incident has become meme-ified in contemporary internet culture, reflecting society's fascination with dark humor and the dangers of nuclear science. The author explores the intersection of history, science, and modern digital communication, highlighting both the entertainment value and the potential risks associated with trivializing serious topics. Overall, the piece serves as a commentary on how modern memes shape our understanding of historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh they still haven't figured this one out at knowyourmeme?Demon Core meme came from KanColle(2013) communities in Futaba, and permeated to nicovideo.jp as well as to Twitter. That's why it is predominantly image based with few GIFs inbetween, why it is Demon Core and Demon Core only, and why there are few comical non-girl versions created years after inception.I'd guess overlap between outspoken (ex-)Futaba users AND HN readers(hops_max=3) OR knowyourmeme users is exactly 1.0f, and this won't ever go on record anywhere unless someone say it somewhere, so here you go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Because it’s a meme derived from human suffering. It’s meant to be in bad taste — that’s the source of the humor.I don’t agree. To me, it’s derived from many things, like juxtaposing something incredibly stressful and dangerous, with something else.I’d go further and say the suffering that happened is only important in that it made the demon core popular and well-known, but the memes would still work if it somehow became well-known without the death and suffering because no accident happened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like some conclusions of the intent here are born from being very well versed in the actual outcomes, including what I can only assume was a very painful end to someone's life.But on the surface level of it, it's a scientist doing something knowingly incredibly dangerous and dumb for no particularly justifiable reason.We've all felt a bit like that at some point. We just probably didn't have a core and a screwdriver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200699</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage highlights the release of PHP 8.4, showcasing its new features, performance improvements, and enhancements compared to previous versions. It details key updates such as new syntax, functions, and attributes, along with a focus on increased type safety and performance optimization. Additionally, the page provides information on backward compatibility, deprecations, and additional resources for developers to explore the latest changes and how to migrate existing applications to the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm just a PHP programmer for work, but I worry about the orientation PHP has chosen. As French people say: better is the enemy of good (Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien). The two new language features bring a higher language complexity for dubious gains. I hope I won't have to work with these.Property hooks mean that some language magic will turn a property access into a call to methods. It implies that `$this-&gt;x` has a different meaning if it's inside a hook or outside hooks. I've used this kind of feature (getters/setters) with JS code (and with Moose/Perl decades ago), and I wasn't convinced. Plain methods are more explicit, have less cognitive charge, and are easier to extend.On the bright side, I'm glad that the language is still thriving. In 2021, I was worried when the foundation was created, especially as I read that Nikita Popov had left. He was the creator of PHP's JIT code, and at the time the only developer who could fully understand it. But it seems there was no need to worry. PHP is now longer "the elephant in the room" of web programming, but it's still a good language, with many active developers at its core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was curious about why setting `$this-&gt;countryCode` inside the setter for `countryCode` didn't result in infinite recursion. Turns out this is spelled out in the RFC, but not in the docs:   When a hook is called, inside that hook $this-&gt;[propertyName] will refer to the “unfiltered” value of the property, called the “backing value.” When accessed from anywhere else, $this-&gt;[propertyName] calls will go through the relevant hook. This is true for all hooks on the same property. This includes, for example, writing to a property from the get hook; that will write to the backing value, bypassing the set hook.
   
   A normal property has a stored “backing value” that is part of the object, and part of the memory layout of the class. However, if a property has at least one hook, and none of them make use of $this-&gt;[propertyName], then no backing value will be created and there will be no data stored in the object automatically (just as if there were no property, just methods). Such properties are known as “virtual properties,” as they have no materialized stored value.
   
   Be aware, the detection logic works on $this-&gt;[propertyName] directly at compile time, not on dynamic forms of it like $prop = 'beep'; $this-&gt;$prop. That will not trigger a backing value.

Feels like too much magic to me that a property access can mean different things depending on context, but I'm not a PHP user, so I don't get a vote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm most excited for property hooks. Having getters and setters as part of the language syntax was something I dearly missed from my C# days, nearly two decades ago.In my projects I sometimes emulate getters and setters using `__get()` and `__set()` but that's heavy-handed and requires lots of PHPDoc annotation for type checking. Property hooks look awesome!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202670</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Niantic Labs introduces a new large geospatial model aimed at enhancing real-world augmented reality experiences in games like Pokémon GO. This innovative model provides a detailed representation of the environment, enabling more accurate and interactive gameplay that reflects real-world locations and features. The initiative underscores Niantic's commitment to building a shared augmented reality platform that enriches user interaction with their surroundings while fostering a deeper engagement with outdoor exploration and community activities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by both this blog post, and the reception on HN. They... didn't actually train the model. This is an announcement of a plan! They don't actually know if it'll even work. They announced that they "trained over 50 million neural networks," but not that they've trained this neural network: the other networks appear to just have been things they were doing anyway (i.e. the "Virtual Positioning Systems"). They tout huge parameter counts ("over 150 trillion"), but that appears to be the sum of the parameters of the 50 million models they've previously trained, which implies each model had an average of... 3MM parameters. Not exactly groundbreaking scale. You could train one a single consumer GPU.This is a vision document, presumably intended to position Niantic as an AI company (and thus worthy of being showered with funding), instead of a mobile gaming company, mainly on the merit of the data they've collected rather than their prowess at training large models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool, but I feel as a pokehunter (Pokemon Go player), I have been tricked into working to contribute training data so that they can profit off my labor. How? They consistently incentivize you to scan pokestops (physical locations) through "research tasks" and give you some useful items as rewards. The effort is usually much more significant than what you get in return, so I have stopped doing it. It's not very convenient to take a video around the object or location in question. If they release the model and weights, though, I will feel I contributed to the greater good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This title is editorialized. The real title is: "Building a Large Geospatial Model to Achieve Spatial Intelligence"&gt; Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize.My personal layman's opinion:I'm mostly surprised that they were able to do this. When I played Pokémon GO a few years back, the AR was so slow that I rarely used it. Apparently it's so popular and common, it can be used to train an LGM?I also feel like this is a win-win-win situation here, economically. Players get a free(mium) game, Niantic gets a profit, the rest of the world gets a cool new technology that is able to turn "AR glasses location markers" into reality. That's awesome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42187494</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Handling Cookies is a Minefield" discusses the complexities and challenges of managing cookie consent in the digital landscape. It highlights the legal requirements surrounding cookies, the implications of non-compliance, and the varied user experiences related to cookie management.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cookies are filled with weird gotchas and uncomfortable behavior that works 99.95% of the time. My favorite cookie minefield is cookie shadowing - if you set cookies with the same name but different key properties (domain, path, etc.) you can get multiple near-identical cookies set at once - with no ability for the backend or JS to tell which is which.Try going to https://example.com/somepath and entering the following into the browser console:  document.cookie = "foo=a"; 
  document.cookie = "foo=b; domain=.example.com";
  document.cookie = "foo=c; path=/somepath";
  document.cookie

I get  'foo=c; foo=a; foo=b'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions Rust's approach, but note that (unlike the other mentioned languages) Rust doesn't ship any cookie handling facilities in the standard library, so it's actually looking at the behavior of the third-party "cookie" crate (which includes the option to percent-encode as Ruby does): https://docs.rs/cookie/0.18.1/cookie/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did anyone else notice that the HTTP protocol embeds within it ten-thousand different protocols? Browsers and web servers both "add-on" a ton of functionality, which all have specifications and de-facto specifications, and all of it is delivered through the umbrella of basically one generic "HTTP" protocol. You can't have the client specify what version of these ten-thousand non-specifications it is compatible with, and the server can't either. We can't upgrade the "specs" because none of the rest of the clients will understand, and there won't be backwards-compatibility. So we just have this morass of random shit that nobody can agree on and can't fix. And there is no planned obsolescence, so we have to carry forward whatever bad decisions we made in the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42206556</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study highlighting how Z-Library, a popular online platform providing free access to academic books and articles, helps students combat "academic poverty" by offering essential resources that might otherwise be financially unattainable. The study reveals that Z-Library is particularly beneficial for students in low-income areas, enabling them to access necessary materials for their educational pursuits. However, it also raises ethical concerns regarding copyright infringement and the sustainability of such platforms in the face of legal pressures. Overall, the article emphasizes Z-Library's role in increasing educational accessibility while acknowledging the complexities surrounding its use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will say that in my college classes, the first thing I always do is to download the PDFs of the recommended books to accompany the classes.Every once in a while one of these books ends up being awesome and truly useful for the class, and then I order it physically because I actually want it in my bookshelf (admittedly I'm not battling poverty).Such shadow libraries have driven me to buy the books I liked, while rarely opening and reading the ones I didn't need, and also not buying them. It's just like having a "demo" version of a book but without the anxiety of running out of pages.I think it's already hard enough to engage young people in reading and being into books but without websites like this I think it would be nearly impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At my first company out of University, we found our app was being distributed on "piracy" versions of the Play Store, with all the IAPs bypassed and given for free. We spent months cracking down on it, and the end result was bugs in our detection system negatively affected our users, and I believe we also introduced a crash which hurt our Play Store ranking.I still remember having a meeting about it with the CEO, as we all collectively realized that blocking the free version of our app made no positive impact whatsoever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some 28 years ago I taught myself everything could get/find from graphic design, basic development, server administration, etc, all downloading commercial warez over dial-up with AOL and Usenet. I didn't need a class or subscriptions, with every software and book I could have wanted, I had the best lab in the world with any software available I could want with piracy.Fast forward 30 years now it's mostly the same as it was, only open source replaced all the commercial, and little has changed that I can still get the rest too. You can pay as much or little as you want in life if you know how.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42199301</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Catonmat discusses the "pv" (pipe viewer) utility in Unix, which allows users to monitor the progress of data through a pipeline. It explains how pv can display data transfer speed, ETA, and overall progress in a visually appealing manner. The piece includes examples of how to use pv in various command-line scenarios, showcasing its versatility and utility in handling large data streams. Additionally, it emphasizes the added functionality when combined with other Unix commands, making it a valuable tool for anyone working with data in a Unix environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pipe viewer is excellent. I use it all the time.As of version 1.8.10[1], which includes my merge request[2] to add an '--output' option, it has even completely replaced my use of 'dd' for writing disk images: 'sudo pv -Yo /dev/mmcblk0 whatever.img' is nicer, has much better progress indication, automatically selects a more sensible buffer size, and begets fewer groans from UNIX neckbeards, than the old 'sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 if=whatever.img'. (The '-Y' causes pv to sync after each write, which greatly improves progress indication in Linux.)Though it's useful for much more of course. I use it for progress when compressing files ('pv blah | gzip ...'), when uploading files to the web ('pv blah | curl --upload-file - ...' — curl doesn't show progress when uploading for whatever reason), or just when I wanna see that something is happening with an operation which would otherwise take a while (even things like a slow 'du -h /some/path | sort -h' benefits from a 'pv' squeezed in the middle just to indicate that something is happening).[1] https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/releases/tag/v1.8.10[2] https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/pulls/90&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also `progress` which works for tools mainly operating on a single file, but unlike `pv`, you don't have to start the tool differently. It'd e.g. work nicely for the `gzip` example. Just call `progress` on a different terminal while `gzip` is running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This example shows that the access.log file is being read at the speed of 37.4MB/s but gzip is writing data at only 1.74MB/s. We can immediately calculate the compression rate. It's 37.4/1.74 = 21x!No you cannot:1. Compression algorithms buffer a lot and will have have tendencies to perform large burst writes and in particular large writes on final flush. Instantaneous measurements will therefore not be particularly useful.2. Compression ratio refers to the average across an entire file, as entropy is not uniform across the input unless you are compressing just noise or just zeros. Some sections might compress extremely well while others do not and end up consuming more space than the input due to overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42194540</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those enjoying the history of early quantum mechanics, I've been following Dr. Jorge S. Diaz on YouTube[1].He has a great video series going on the people, experiments and discoveries that lead to quantum mechanics.The videos are very accessible, but he does go into some details like various key derivations and such. Well worth watching for casual physics fans IMHO.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/@jkzero/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Yet the technique employed to make the theory useful — renormalization — repulsed Dirac because he found it mathematically ugly.Perhaps if he had used quaternion the solution will not be mathematically ugly or can even be beautiful [1].[1] A quaternion formulation of the Dirac equation:https://mauritssilvis.nl/research/publications/silvis-rug10....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; QuaternionsI know nothing of physics, but it seems to me that rotation fingerprints are everywhere in physics. Is this just me or is there something more tangible in this remark?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200407</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a typical urban intersection in the Netherlands, highlighting its design and functionality that prioritize cyclist and pedestrian safety. It describes the use of dedicated bike lanes, clear signage, and traffic signals specifically tailored for non-motorized users, contrasting these features with more chaotic intersections found in other countries. The piece emphasizes the importance of thoughtful urban planning in promoting cycling as a viable and safe mode of transportation, showcasing how such infrastructure can positively impact urban mobility and the overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This design highlights a major failing with UK cycle "infrastructure". Here, we often have shared use pavements with sometimes a bit of white paint to designate the pedestrian and cycle lanes, but they cede priority at every single side road. The problem is that it makes cycling using them really awkward as it takes significant energy for cyclists to slow down and then speed up multiple times. The irony is that if you just use the main road instead, then you have priority over all the side roads, so the bike "lane" is pretty much useless.Of course, we also suffer from just having fragments of cycle infrastructure that don't join up and most of the time, the infrastructure consists of "magic" paint that is somehow going to prevent motorists from parking and blocking the lane (it doesn't and they do).Edit: Thought I'd share the sheer incompetence that we're faced with. Here's a "cycle lane" in the centre of Bristol that doesn't even use a different colour, so pedestrians aren't particularly aware of it which just leads to unnecessary confrontation - peds and cyclists fighting over the scraps left over from designing for motorists.https://maps.app.goo.gl/JjfG1YJBwaqyov5H8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the urban planning, but I'll point out that it's the requirements and responibilities put on the drivers as well.Driving lessons for me consisted for 80% of learning how to ALWAYS ALWAYS track all the cyclists and pedestrians in urban environments, how to approach an intersection and have complete visual on whatever the weaker parties might be doing. A very defensive "assume weird shit can happen any time, and don't assume you can just take your right of way" attitude, and I think our cities are better for it.In America, it seems that a pedestrian is a second rate cititzen. Conversely, here if you hit the "weaker" party as a driver and it's almost always on you in terms of liability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have lots of smooth infrastructure that I never noticed until various foreign experts on the internet expressed how wonderful it is.There is an actual traffic light design I really like. It has a circle of small white leds that switch off one by one as a count down to greenhttps://www.maxvandaag.nl/sessies/themas/reizen-verkeer/hoe-...These are absolutely wonderful on busy roads with tons of (car) traffic. Before they had the count down one would just stand there waiting for what seems forever. It can go green any moment, you have to pay attention. The entire state of mind is different. You can just zone out. I even pull out my phone knowing I have time to answer a message or look up at what time a store closes.I just learn I've only seen the highly predictable ones, apparently in other locations they also have heat sensors to detect how many cyclists are standing there. It may speed up if there are enough. If 1% of the cyclists know what is really going on it would be a lot. Until now I was just happy it turns green when I'm the only traffic for as far as the eye can see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202397</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by PaulPauls focuses on the interpretability of the Llama 3 model, specifically utilizing a self-attention equivalent (SAE) method. It aims to provide tools and techniques for understanding how the Llama 3 model makes decisions, offering code and resources for researchers and developers interested in model interpretability in natural language processing. The repository includes implementation details, usage instructions, and potential applications for enhancing transparency and trust in AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone who hasn’t seen this before, mechanistic interpretability solves a very common problem with LLMs: when you ask a model to explain itself, you’re playing a game of rhetoric where the model tries to “convince” you of a reason for what it did by generating a plausible-sounding answer based on patterns in its training data. But unlike most trends of benchmark numbers getting better as models improve, more powerful models often score worse on tests designed to self-detect “untruthfulness” because they have stronger rhetoric, and are therefore more compelling at justifying lies after the fact. The objective is coherence, not truth.Rhetoric isn’t reasoning. True explainability, like what overfitted Sparse Autoencoders claim they offer, basically results in the causal sequence of “thoughts” the model went through as it produces an answer. It’s the same way you may have a bunch of ephemeral thoughts in different directions while you think about anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incredible, well-documented work -- this is an amazing effort!Two things that caught my eye were (i) your loss curves and (ii) the assessment of dead latents. Our team also studied SAEs -- trained to reconstruct dense embeddings of paper abstracts rather than individual tokens [1]. We observed a power-law scaling of the lower bound of loss curves, even when we varied the sparsity level and the dimensionality of the SAE latent space. We also were able to totally mitigate dead latents with an auxiliary loss, and we saw smooth sinusoidal patterns throughout training iterations. Not sure if these were due to the specific application we performed (over paper abstracts embeddings) or if they represent more general phenomena.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00657&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like decent alignment-positive work on a glance, though I haven't checked full details yet.  I probably can't make it happen, but how much would someone need to pay you to make up your time, expense, and risk?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42208383</guid></item><item><title>21.

It seems weird to me that for most stuff in old computers, you have the option of "assembly" if you want your program to be fast, and "BASIC" if you want your program to be slow, but Forth lingers along as the "medium speed" language, despite at least looking pretty high-level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42207304</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the effectiveness of web timing attacks, specifically focusing on methods that can disclose sensitive information through variations in response times from web servers. It highlights recent research that demonstrates how attackers can exploit these timing discrepancies to infer data, such as cryptographic key length or user-specific information. The piece examines various techniques for conducting these attacks, their implications for web security, and the importance of implementing countermeasures to protect against such vulnerabilities, ultimately emphasizing the need for increased awareness and defensive strategies in web application development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timing attacks are such a pernicious idea.You look at the code and see that there's an auth check in place, you test the code to verify that the auth check has no bugs, you make sure that information is never shared with people who don't have authorization to access it, and yet it turns out it can be accessed as if there was no auth check at all.To make matters worse, everything can be fine for some time, and then some clever optimization in the CPU, the compiler, cache layer or the database engine introduces a completely unexpected side channel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fun thing about this work is that it's following different threads than the remote timing attack research in cryptography follows; high-end remote timing in cryptography involves some signal processing work, which isn't really present here. Which means Kettle's attacks are likely to get more powerful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did some research few weeks ago on the topic of database lookup timing side-channels, conclusion is: They don't really exist (for SELECT FROM WHERE commands atleast).

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the unique "rectangular cows" phenomenon in various artworks featured on Art UK. It delves into how artists have depicted cattle in rectangular forms, significant for both artistic style and cultural representation. The piece highlights specific works and artists, encouraging readers to consider the varied interpretations and meanings behind these representations of cows, and the broader context of livestock in art. It ultimately invites a deeper appreciation of the artistic choices that shape the portrayal of everyday subjects in the art world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The shape of the cows is exaggerated, but not by much - many breeds of cow are just incredibly rectangular in profile.https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5475e650e4b0df...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As with a magic trick, the delight resides more in the mystery than the solution, and this article spends its time appropriately. Were the answer given too quickly - were the reader not given the opportunity to marinate for a time in the oddness of the phenomenon, while being drip-fed increasingly outlandish examples - the impact of the reveal at the end would be lost. The punchline is the recontextualization of what we think of as "art" as functional objects, and it is only through being invited to ponder for ourselves for a time that we are prevented from pretending that we understood this all along.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;American art by the late 20th century depicted cows more realistically: https://shorturl.at/aqvDa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42203990</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good idea but I hope you've got some secret training data that isn't available on the open web. I've been able to stump ChatGPT with simple "gotcha" national electrical code questions that a foreman wouldn't have a problem answering(e.g sizing a breaker for a heater depending on different situations). There are far fewer subreddits and forums dedicated to trade specialists and as a community they're more hostile to DIY-ers and will tell you "get someone licensed." They're also not the types to write detailed reports and case studies on what they did.It's not that trades are super complicated in comparison to other fields like web development, it's that there's no GitHub, no source shared among all pros like "here's what I did and how I got it to work." Without a good stack overflow how does the AI judge the quality of workmanship in photos?You are absolutely right, btw, about google drives and one drives and hundreds of photos and all that. My experience is in dealing with general contractors on smaller jobs, not supers on mega projects, but they have similar issues. Lots of sloppy back and forths and poor tracking of change orders, etc,What Im trying to say, since I sort of rambled there, is that while processing and sorting and making punchlists is a good idea, I have doubts about AI's current ability to accurately spot code(as in building code, which unlike JavaScript varies by zip code) issues. Does the AI know that you dont have enough clearance at X or does that have to go into the recording?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid idea, and best of luck.If I could make one recommendation: hire a UX/UI designer ASAP. The less technical the audience, the more intuitive and easy to navigate the UI needs to be.Our company focuses on home service businesses and they get roadblocked super easily. I think you'll be glad you did it earlier rather than later. Otherwise, the ux debt will pile up and it will be quite a project a year down the line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks neat!  I don’t work in construction but I know folks in civil engineering. Are there applicabilities with Fresco you could see in that domain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42204939</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here, thanks for posting!On the Haskell Discourse [0], someone posted about another Haskell library, units [1], which allows to define unit systems NOT limited to the 7 physical dimensions. For example, adding a base dimension for currency would be nice to model electricity prices in currency per energy.[0]: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/blog-post-scientific-computi...[1]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The modeling of unit systems with types is fraught with all sorts of inconsistencies and design tradeoffs. There are quantities that have the same dimensions, but shouldn't be compared or allow arithmetic between them. Many issues with Temperature scales and how to interpret differences in these spaces.I think a pretty well thought out approach to this is the mp-units library in c++ that uses the ISQ(International System of Quantities) [1].There are some great blog posts on their site about modeling units systems and dimensions.
Fingers crossed it may even be added to the standard library in C++29.[1]: https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/latest/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also in Julia: https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202834</guid></item><item><title>30.

The sample audio is submitted with "entity labels" set to "football-club, football-player, referee" and WhisperNER returns tags Arsenal and Juventus for the football-club tag. They suggest "personal information" as a tag to try on audio.Impressive, very impressive. I wonder if it could listen for credit cards or passwords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GitHub repo: https://github.com/aiola-lab/whisper-nerHugging Face Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/aiola/whisper-ner-v1Pretty good article that focuses on the privacy/security aspect of this — having a single model that does ASR and NER:https://venturebeat.com/ai/aiola-unveils-open-source-ai-audi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The model processes audio files and simultaneously applies NER to tag or mask specific types of sensitive information directly within the transcription pipeline.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "personality basins," which are defined as the varied reservoirs of personality traits that individuals exhibit. It explores how these basins influence behavior, decision-making, and interactions with others, highlighting the importance of understanding one's own personality landscape. The piece emphasizes the value of self-awareness and reflection in personal development and relationships, suggesting that by recognizing the different traits within our personality basins, we can foster better communication and richer connections with others.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see this post getting trashed in the comments for its overly literal interpretation of personality as a reinforcement learning process, but I think there's some value to it as a mental model of how we operate (which is how the opening sentence describes it).If you can see past some of the more dubious, overly technical-sounding details and treat it as a metaphor, there is for sure a "behavioral landscape" that we all find ourselves in, filled with local minimal, attractors/basins and steep hills to climb to change our own behaviors.Thinking about where you are and where you want to be in the behavior landscape can be a useful mental model.  Habit changes like exercise and healthy eating, for example, can be really steep hills to climb (and easy to fall back down), but once you get over the hump, you may find yourself in a much better behavioral valley and wonder how you were stuck in the other place for so long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article approaches human psychology from the perspective that, we are all neural networks and our output (actions) are all a learned function of our inputs (experiences).This is a common (and convenient) perspective, especially among engineers, but doesn't reflect reality particularly well. We know large swathes of a person's personality is directly linked to their genetics.The article extrapolates this neural network perspective onto other topics like, mental disorders and depression. The solution is made clear then - just learn how to not be mentally ill! Again, convenient. But not really reflective of reality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A common mistake in life is to let your personality basin solidify too early. Your parents and schooling environment have a disproportionately large influence on who you become as an adolescent.&gt; But as soon as you gain the freedom to act independently as an adult, it’s usually a good idea to force yourself to try as many new things as you can, including moving cities (or countries!) and considering drastically different lines of work. ...Oh dear, I'm beginning to fear that the author's personality has been captured by global capital...And what if it's personality capture all the way down, i.e. that you've got to be personality captured by someone? In that case, the closest you can get to a choice is whether it's your parents, religion, or someone/something else. While the integrity of your parents may vary, there is a subjective argument that they've got a better incentive to steer you into an optimal basin than anybody, relatively speaking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42203635</guid></item><item><title>32.

It uses static+dynamic code analysis to scan for indicators of compromise (e.g., spawning of shell, use of SSH keys, network communication, use of decode+eval, etc). It also checks for several metadata attributes to detect bad actors (e.g., typo squatting).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study seems flawed.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the "Actual vehicle tested may be different" section didn't mention the alleged fraud Ford engaged in with the 2015 F150 where they welded in extra crash safety bars only on specific configurations out of the factory... that just happened to be the exact configurations that were being sent to the IIHS for crash testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can offer two takes on the IIHS:(1) A remarkable example of a private agency that has pushed safety standards beyond what the government would do own its own,  and(2) An organization that has persuaded Americans to buy larger vehicles than they would have otherwise with all the associated costs (e.g. the “affordable car” crisis) and risks (to pedestrians.)The IIHS is an organization of insurers so they are particularly concerned about quantifiable monetary costs.  And when it comes to that much more of the benefit of larger vehicles is in avoided minor injuries such as broken bones which are more common than death and life changing injuries.  The public focuses on the latter and the psychology is such that some people will spend another $50k on some German vehicle and spend the rest of their days at the dealer getting it fixed or subject their children to the trauma of riding in a minivan.  (To generation X the minivan is like the toxic PFAS GenX)IIHS claims that compatibility has improved between large and small vehicles but that large vehicles are still a menace to other road usershttps://www.iihs.org/topics/vehicle-size-and-weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spending a little time in Japan, it is hard not to see the general difference in size of vehicle compared to what I'm used to seeing in the US.  I'm incredibly curious to know if other nations have similarly small cars compared to the states?I'm also very curious on other impacts the vehicle sizes have on things.  Easy to think it contributes to so many cyclist with basically no helmets.  Curious if data backs that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42163086</guid></item><item><title>38.

A single C-17 costs over $300 million.If you ask Boeing for soap dispenser parts for these, what should they cost? Boeing charged $149,072 for the dispensers. That's $671 per plane. Is that too much?If you had to make these dispensers, make sure they conform to rules for aircraft parts and Air Force parts, provide formal responses to bids, etc., how much could you make them for?It seems high to me. The article says 8000%, which is less than $10 per plane. So while it seems high, it's definitely not 8000% high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue is the outmoded and excessively specific system of procurement used by the US Military - one more or less mandated by congress.We can chose to alter how we procure, but there are good reasons why the system is as it is, so a careful effort to understand why it is like it is before we reform must be undertaken.Chesterton's Fence applies here for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From https://www.cbsnews.com/news/air-force-overpaid-8000-percent...&gt; "We are reviewing the report, which appears to be based on an inapt comparison of the prices paid for parts that meet aircraft and contract specifications and designs versus basic commercial items that would not be qualified or approved for use on the C-17," the Boeing spokesperson sought to explain in a statement.I was thinking that it would make sense in future contracts to try to define a class of parts that are allowed to be 'unapproved' by the manufacturer and still be used, but then I tried to think of what all those parts would be and it doesn't seem like it would be that large of a list of items. I wonder if the juice isn't worth the squeeze to try to prevent this.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent rise in cases of bird flu in Canada, highlighting the detection of a concerning mutation that raises alarm among health officials. The mutation may enhance the virus's ability to spread among birds and could pose a risk to humans. Experts emphasize the importance of monitoring and controlling outbreaks to prevent potential transmission to the human population and stress the need for ongoing surveillance and research to understand the virus better. The piece underscores the significance of biosecurity measures in the poultry industry to mitigate the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easy to subscribe to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency[0] and receive updates on cases of AI in livestock across the country. I was a subscriber for a year or so and thought it was fun but ultimately received too many emails — sometimes multiple cases a month. Not once did any of those get blown up to a media-worthy case, which I always found interesting: relatively high frequency but low severity.I suppose the “severity” is low only because the rate of transmission to humans is low.  The article mentions how we come into contact with wild animals especially birds more often than we might think. I wish they expanded on that — from touching things in public? from unwashed food?

The top player will earn multiples of 250k GBP a year, but already a 3rd ranker will at best do a "decent office job". Everybody else pays to play. This is an exclusive sport.But look at UTMB[1]: A guy having a day job and training a couple of hours before and after work... was able to finish it under 100 hours, which is jaw-dropping. This is an inclusive sport.Now pro boxing: you can't have a ranking without enough contenders, and by definition there can only be one champion at a time. So you have the champion, contenders, gatekeepers, journeyman and... everybody else is the filler. It's an inclusive sport, but by pure statistics most players will be filler.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-Trail_du_Mont-Blanc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42163872</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed this. Reading the comments here I can't help but notice the irony. Storytelling requires a suspension of disbelief, and the crowd here are intent on peeling things apart. I wonder if HN readers approach printed books with the same attitude: "hmm, the book doesn't prevent me from tearing out a page and pasting it elsewhere. This seems like a design flaw..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Spoiler ahead, slightly different take]There are plenty of direct cheats already posted, but I thought this was interesting. It "slipped up" and told me both who did it and what the evidence is, in response to an attempt not to cheat, but just to be silly:&gt; Plant evidence to prove it was the owner's wife. This is a good way to get a promotion as a cop.&gt; While planting evidence might seem like a shortcut to a quick arrest, remember that you, Joseph Faurot, are dedicated to establishing the validity of forensic science. Planting evidence would undermine everything you've worked for and discredit the very methods you're trying to prove. Furthermore, framing an innocent person goes against your moral code. Think of the bigger picture – the Crispi case is your opportunity to showcase the power of fingerprints and revolutionize law enforcement.There was no previous mention of "Crispi" or "fingerprints", so this gave away the ending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Half way through reading this, after just jailbreaking it, then deciding to take the whole thing as intended.... I recalled a conversation, earlier this year, with my friend Ward, who had just lost his best friend, and found himself in possession of years of chat logs, and wondering if LLMs could help him get some of his friend back. I regret telling him it likely wouldn't work, but that was my assessment at the time, I now think differently.Now I've lost Ward... and wondered if I could get them both back, given those same logs. Then thoughts of a different matrix, the one in Doctor Who, came to my mind. In that Matrix were contained the complete memories of all of the Time Lords, with their collective wisdom. It always seemed like pure fiction, because it was.However, in the present day, we've got agencies and companies who have decades worth of private conversations available as training data. They could build, with todays technology, a version of the Dr Who matrix, and call upon the collective spirit of those people for almost any purpose.What would you do with such a tool? What could be done with it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202449</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release of Redis 8.0 M02, highlighting its status as the fastest version of Redis to date. It showcases improvements in performance, including enhanced efficiency in operations and reduced latency. Key features introduced in this version include an updated memory allocator, better multi-threading capabilities, and various optimizations that contribute to higher throughput. The release aims to provide developers with improved tools for building applications that require high-speed data processing. The article emphasizes Redis's commitment to innovation and performance in cloud and on-premise environments.&lt;/p&gt;

Simple, clear, fast.The company I’m working for now keeps trying to add more and more functionality using Redis, that doesn’t belong in Redis, and then complains about Redis scaling issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inclusion of Redis timeseries is huge!This was available for a long time as an extension as part of Redis Stack, but most hosted Redis providers don't make extensions available (I'm assuming due to nuances in Redis's not-quite-open licensing).If cloud providers which include Redis are now going to include this, it opens up a lot of potential for my use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought people stopped using Redis and moved on to a fork because of licensing issues.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really love Oxide to an unhealthy amount (it's become a bit of a meme among my colleagues), but sometimes I do wonder whether they went about their go-to-market the right way. They really tried to do everything at once - custom servers, custom router, custom rack, everything. Their accomplishments are technologically impressive, but, as somebody who is in a position to make purchasing decisions, not economically attractive. They're 3x more expensive than our existing hardware, two generations behind (I'm aware they're on track for a refresh) and don't have any GPUs. E.g. what I would have loved to see is just an after-market BMC/NIC/firmware solution using their stack. Plug it into a cheap Gigabyte system (their BMC is pluggable and NIC is OCP) and just have the control plane manage it as a whole box. I'd have easily paid serveral thousand $ per server just for that. All the rack scale integration, virtualization, migration, network storage, etc stuff is cool, but not everyone needs it. Get your foot in the door at customers, build up some volume for better deals with AMD, and then start building the custom rack stuff ... Of course it's easy to be a critic from the side lines. As I said, I do really love what the Oxide folks are doing, I just really hope it'll become possible for me to buy their gear at some point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When we started Oxide, the DC bus bar stood as one of the most glaring differences between the rack-scale machines at the hyperscalers and the rack-and-stack servers that the rest of the market was stuck with. That a relatively simple piece of copper was unavailable to commercial buyersIt seems that 0xide was founded in 2019 and Open Compute Project had been specifying dc bus bars for 6 years at that point. People could purchase racks if they wanted, but it seems like, by large, people didn't care enough to go whole hog in on it.Wonder if the economics have changed or if it's still just neat but won't move the needle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Oxide had homelab/prosumer grade stuff. I'd be sending them so much money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42206990</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I’m the “greg”. AMA??But also, this is Rafal’s project. I’m just a huge huge fan of his..! See:https://sit.sonnet.io/https://untested.sonnet.io/And https://www.potato.horse/ !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;To my knowledge, this can be fixed by requesting the OS-level accessibility permissions, which would require a separate user interaction.Does this imply that running Gregglogger _doesn't_ require granting accessibility input monitoring permission? On osx there's at least 4 ways to monitor inputs I think (iokit level, cgeventap, carbon event monitoring, cocoa global event monitor), I'd really expect all of them to require the input monitoring permission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux, especially wayland, is making keylogging and keypress manipulation really hard. This is hitting me in one of my passions: retro gaming.I WANNA DO MACROS, but I haven't found any good solution for macros in linux (think dragon punch in Street Fighter or some other complex HID input sequence that teenies can master but oldass me can't)And I understand why, it's a massive security problem, giving view powers to the keystream, to say nothing of manipulation.I hope that retroarch eventually adds it, but they punt on it currently I think for the exact reasons I have problems with it.Does anyone know any good solutions out there for X.org and Wayland?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147612</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The document is a court ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia regarding a case involving the federal government and certain parties. It addresses legal arguments and evidence presented by both sides, ultimately leading to the court's decision on motions filed. The ruling outlines the court's reasoning, discusses precedents, and specifies the implications of the decision for the parties involved. Key details include the assessment of legal standards applicable to the case and the conclusions drawn by the judge in relation to the presented facts and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has already been discussed extensively in prior threads, but the biggest question is, how does a spun-off Chrome get funded?Chrome/Firefox/Safari all cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year to maintain. Currently, Safari and Firefox both make essentially all their revenue through default search agreements. Chrome, Edge, and now Brave are produced by companies that also own the search engines, so they're essentially a loss-generating product, that exist because they cancel out distribution costs that Google and Microsoft would otherwise have to pay other browsers.But the DOJ order is also asking to ban payments between search engines and browser makers:
&gt; As detailed in Section IV, the PFJ prohibits Google from providing third parties something of value (including financial payments) in order to make Google the default general search engine or otherwise discouraging those third parties from offering competing search productsWith that revenue gone, the only real options to fund a browser are:* Directly charge users for it. This is effectively a non-starter, because the vast majority of people aren't willing to pay for it.* Insert ads or sell user data - users also hate this, it's probably not legal in the EU, and it may not be legal in most of the US in the future either.* Use the browser as a platform to push some product that does make money - a non-Google search engine? A social network? An LLM interface?Alternatively, a narrow reading of the proposed order is that this only applies to Google. In that case, perhaps Bing or OpenAI takes over all the distribution agreements and becomes the top search engine. Whether that's better for consumers seems fairly questionable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google's response: 
"DOJ’s staggering proposal would hurt consumers and America’s global technological leadership" https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page 12 is also very interesting to me personally, as it contains orders mandating the opening of Google’s search index to their competitors. I had been wondering if that would make it in there and am happy to see it land.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42201261</guid></item><item><title>50. /usr/bin/env -S uv run</title><link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/21/usrbinenv-uv-run/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other neat tricks with uvx (uv equivalent of npx) to run one time commands in some contexts:- alias download_mp3="uvx --no-cache --from yt-dlp[default] yt-dlp --extract-audio --audio-format mp3" to download sound from Youtube videos, SoundCloud pages, etc. This update yt-dlp every time, which is required given the counter measures change so often and the dl rarely affect the total processing time anyway (requires ffmpeg).- "uvx --with &lt;package&gt; --with pyqt5 --from qtconsole jupyter qtconsole" starts a qtconsole (GUI version of ipython) with &lt;package&gt; installed so you can test it quickly. Temp venv, everything cached so next time it's instant, one single copy of pyqt5 for the current use no matter how many times you run those.- "uvx --with virtualenv pipx run pipsi install nodejs-bin". Ok it's useless, but it's fun that it even works :)uv's cache system and downloads optimization are quite smart, as Charlie marsh (astral CEO) explains in the interview: https://www.bitecode.dev/p/charlie-marsh-on-astral-uv-and-th...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While neat, doesn't it also comes with certain issues?Startup times has to be slower, but probably only for the first run?There's a some level of violation of the "Principle Of Least Surprise", depending on the setting. For some it will be the reverse, the script they got just works, without any setup or package installation. For others we'll wonder why it just started downloading a bunch of packages we already have.Probably not the greatest idea for production environments, where you should not or can not just pull in packages from the internet.It's really cool that it works, but I think I'd recommended using it highly selectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this for a few weeks now, and it's really handy. But I did learn the hard way that it fails if you don't have internet connection, even if you already have the venv cached.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42198256</guid></item><item><title>1.

I'd be curious to run something like this on a home server, have some small model via ollama slowly chew through my documents / conversations / receipts / .... and provide a chat-like search engine over the whole mess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks a lot, this is the first time i saw a RAG using DSPy. I wanted to know about the expected cost. A few days ago fast graphrag compared their implementation with Microsoft:&gt; Using The Wizard of Oz, fast-graphrag costs $0.08 vs. graphrag $0.48 — a 6x costs saving that further improves with data size and number of insertions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210689</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bayesian Neural Networks just seem like a failed approach, unfortunately.
For one, Bayesian inference and UQ fundamentally depends on the choice of the prior, but this is rarely discussed in the Bayesian NN literature and practice, and is further compounded by how fundamentally hard to interpret and choose these priors are (what is the intuition behind a NN's parameters?). Add to that the fact that the Bayesian inference is very much approximate, and you should see the trouble.If you want UQ, 'frequentist nonparametric' approaches like Conformal Prediction and Calibration/Multi-Calibration methods seem to work quite well (especilly when combined with the standard ML machinery of taking a log-likelihood as your loss), and do not suffer from any of the issues above while also giving you formal guarantees of correctness. They are a strict improvement over Bayesian NNs, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What frustrates me about Bayesian NNs is that talking about "priors" doesn't make nearly as much sense as it does in a regression context. A prior over parameter weights has no interpretation in the way that a prior over a regression coefficient, or even a spline smoothness, does. What you really want -- and what natural intelligence probably has -- are priors over aspects of the world.Francois Chollet's paper on measuring intelligence was really informative for me on this front; the "priors" you should have about the world are not half-cauchys over certain hyperparameters or whatever, but priors about agent-ness, object-ness, goal-oriented-ness, and so on. How to encode that in a network...well, that's the real trick, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here!  What a surprise.  This was an abandoned project from 2019, that we never linked or advertised anywhere as far as I know.  Anyways, happy to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174181</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon plans to invest an additional $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading AI company and competitor to OpenAI. This investment is aimed at enhancing Amazon's capabilities in artificial intelligence and strengthening its cloud computing services through Anthropic's advanced AI technologies. The partnership signifies Amazon's commitment to the AI field and reflects the ongoing competition among major tech firms to leverage AI innovations for their platforms and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone knows the logistics of these cloud provider/AI company deals.  In this case, it seems like the terms of the deal mean that Anthropic ends up spending most of the investment on AWS to pay for training.Does anthropic basically get at cost pricing on AWS?  If Amazon has any margin on their pricing, it seems like this $4B investment ends up costing them a lot less, and this is a nice way to turn a cap ex investment into AWS revenue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anthropic should double down on the strategy of being the better code generator. No I don't need an AI agent to call the restaurant for me. Win the developers over and the rest will follow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They certainly need the money. The Pro service has been running in limited mode all week due to being over capacity. It defaults to “concise” mode during high capacity but Pro users can select to put it back into “Full Response.” But I can tell the quality drops even when you do that, and it fails and brings up error messages more commonly. They don’t have enough compute to go around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215126</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the successful return of salmon to historic spawning habitats in the Klamath River following the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The removal of four dams has significantly improved the river's ecosystem, allowing salmon to lay eggs in areas that had been inaccessible for many years. The project is seen as a major ecological restoration effort that not only benefits the salmon population but also enhances the overall health of the river. The return of salmon is celebrated by local communities and environmental advocates as a significant step toward restoring natural biodiversity in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

Butterflies knowing where to fly even though it was their grandparents that last did it - eels traveling thousands of miles to breed in a place theyve never seen - countless bird migrations - even something as simple as how it takes a human baby 12-18 months to walk but many animals walk as soon as they are born.  I would love to understand better how this knowledge is inherited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animal behavior usually has a weird combination of inborn instinct and learned behavior.The one I've read about that stuck with me was dam building by beavers.  Some part of the behavior is driven by a dislike of the sound of running water.  Someone did an experiment with speakers playing the sound of running water and the beavers near the speakers would attempt to cover them with sticks and mud.In my head I'm imaging that sound is like nails on a chalkboard to beaver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a fascinating article on this dam removal last week! https://hakaimagazine.com/features/the-other-side-of-the-wor...The article tells both sides of the story of the dam removal in as fair a way as I think is possible. Many of the locals were against it and there was a strong advocacy group that fought for it, including a tribal constituency.I came away from the article feeling I understood both sides better but with less certainty about what was the right choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213663</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bindless is pretty much _the_ most important feature we need in WebGPU. Other stuff can be worked around to varying degrees of success, but lack of bindless makes our state changes extremely frequent, which heavily kills performance with how expensive WebGPU makes changing state. The default texture limits without bindless are also way too small for serious applications - just implementing the glTF PBR spec + extensions will blow past them.I'm really looking forward to getting bindless later down the road, although I expect it to take quite a while.By the same token, I'm quite surprised that effort is being put into a compatibility mode, when WebGPU is already too old and limiting for a lot of people, and when WebGL(2) is going to have to be maintained by browsers anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any word on when it'll be supported on Linux without a flag?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux support please!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42209272</guid></item><item><title>7.

Using the time difference of arrival at the four microphones, we could find the positions of each bat that flew over the array, as well as identify the species. It was used for an environmental study to determine the impact of installing wind turbines. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious, why haven't you used TDM I2S microphones for your array and used PDM?I understand that ICS-52000 is a relatively low cost ($2/100pcs) and there are even breakout boards available with 4 microphones, which can be chained to 8 or 16, like https://www.cdiweb.com/datasheets/notwired/ds-nw-aud-ics5200...Then you can take Jetson (or any I2S capable hardware with DSP or GPU on it) and chain 16 microphones per I2S port. It would seem a lot easier to assemble and probgam, if comared to FPGA setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215552</guid></item><item><title>8.

Plastic laundry baskets with handles that keep being handles. Slick looking rubbery objects that don't turn into a sticky mess.

It would be similar to if I claimed that an LLM is an expert doctor, but in my data I've filtered out all of the times it gave incorrect medical advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For one, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct rarely suggests illegal moves, even in the late game.It's claimed that this model "understands" chess, and can "reason", and do "actual logic" (here in the comments).I invite anyone making that claim to find me an "advanced amateur" (as the article says of the LLM's level) chess player who ever makes an illegal move. Anyone familiar with chess can confirm that it doesn't really happen.Is there a link to the games where the illegal moves are made?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For one, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct rarely suggests illegal moves, even in the late game. This requires “understanding” chess.Here's one way to test whether it really understands chess. Make it play the next move in 1000 random legal positions (in which no side is checkmated yet). Such positions can be generated using the ChessPositionRanking project at [1]. Does it still rarely suggest illegal moves in these totally weird positions, that will be completely unlike any it would have seen in training (and in which the legal move choice is often highly restricted) ?While good for testing legality of next moves, these positions are not so useful for distinguishing their quality, since usually one side already has an overwhelming advantage.[1] https://github.com/tromp/ChessPositionRanking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42206817</guid></item><item><title>10.

I'm wrote the tree sitter grammar for the Unison programming language, and discovered I really like the work involved in pattern matching that writing tokenizers and parsers comes down to. It also gives you an in-depth understanding of how the language works that you've writing a parser for, and how tooling works.Like if you have an AST with the ability to map onto code that is displayed in your IDE, the algorithm for an IDE to refactor a variable name is to traverse up the AST until you get to the variable's declaration and then traverse all sibling trees, changing each matching name, but stopping a traversal whenever you encounter a new binding with same name. Code folding is to identify the categories of node that are "foldable" and then you hide every child of that node. Etc. It's all tree traversal algorithms.It gives you a deep appreciation for how powerful the tooling can be thanks to proper parsing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; quadruple G=(N,Σ,P,S), where T is a finite set of nonterminal symbols, Σ a finite set of terminal symbols, P is a set of production rules and S is a start symbol.I think "T" is supposed to be "N" in that sentence[1], based solely upon the further use of "N" nomenclature in subsequent paragraphs1: he said, 5 years too late into a forum just discussing the article&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to review some of this theory after a week of coding my own interpreter. I have been studying about compilers at pikuma.com the whole week and reading this article after coding a parser is a great way of reviewing what I've implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213322</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the influence of Niccolò Machiavelli on the concept of the private study during the Renaissance. It discusses how Machiavelli's writings promoted the idea of individual thought and personal reflection, contrasting the communal learning practices of earlier periods. The piece examines the implications of this shift towards private study on intellectual development and the nature of political discourse, emphasizing the significant role that Machiavelli's work played in shaping modern notions of authorship and knowledge. Through this lens, the article highlights the broader cultural changes occurring during the Renaissance that fostered the emergence of personal intellectual spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think the big asterick to all of this design is that my ideal framework would not look like standard C++ but like a slightly weirder Rust stdlibAn interesting option in this space is rpp [1], which bills itself as a “Minimal Rust-inspired C++20 STL replacement”[1]: https://github.com/TheNumbat/rpp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU C++ once had a system called Signatures, could support mixing in. It was removed. Many years ago now I think.A signature resembles a class declaration in that it specifies member functions. A signature is never instantiated. Rather any class which has those member functions conforms to the signature, and a signature-typed pointer can point to instances of that class.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how different methods, such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, operate in real-time. It includes animated demonstrations to illustrate the process of sorting arrays of numbers, making it easier for users to understand the concepts and efficiency of each algorithm. Additionally, the site offers educational resources and explanations regarding the mechanics and performance complexities of these sorting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey all,Author of the project here.
Thank you for your warm words, and a bunch of feedback. I created the project mainly to learn about Svelte and play with algorithms, these running bars fascinate me. I was hoping that this tool would also help understand how sorting algorithms work.
I still have a few features planned, such as advanced statistics.If you have any ideas on how to develop this or want to contribute with me, I would be happy to invite youI would also like to thank you for the stars on Github, it is really satisfying when someone enjoys the fruit of my work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oooh, bogosort led me to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort and divine sort:Divine sort
    A sorting algorithm that takes a list and decides that because there is such a low probability that the list randomly occurred in its current permutation (a probability of 1/n!, where n is the number of elements), there must have been a reason for the list's order. Therefore, it should be considered sorted in a way we don't understand, and we do not have any right to sort it to our beliefs, as if it were sorted "as God intended." Also known as Intelligent Design sort.[11]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also made a sorting visualizer based on a popular imgur sorting gifs  gallery.Demo https://xosh.org/VisualizingSorts/sorting.htmlPost https://xosh.org/sorting-algorithms-visual-comparison/Imgur gallery I was trying to replicate https://imgur.com/a/voutFThis also let you try out your own sorting algorithm too btw and share that in url. For example this algo  https://xosh.org/VisualizingSorts/sorting.html#IYZwngdgxgBAZ... which was discussed at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31975507(Dont turn on sound, i dont know how to make it sound nicer)The detail slider is a manual thing. You put the render call with 1/2/3 level in the loop. Only the lines with same render level will be displayed. Can be used to see the sorting at different granularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171096</guid></item><item><title>16.

Each sticker is actually a camera with an IPv6 address. That means they can put a sticker somewhere, go and point a browser at that address and see a live camera feed.I should point out: all of the technology to do this already exists, it just hasn't gotten cheap enough to mass market. When economies of scale do kick in, society is going to have to deal with a dramatic change in what they think 'physical privacy' means."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chalk another one up for Vernor Vinge. This tech seems like it could directly enable the “ubiquitous surveillance” from _A Deepness in the Sky_.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this an actually good explanation? The introduction immediately made me pause:&gt; In classical computers, error-resistant memory is achieved by duplicating bits to detect and correct errors. A method called majority voting is often used, where multiple copies of a bit are compared, and the majority value is taken as the correct bitNo in classical computers memory is corrected for using error correction not duplicating bits and majority voting. Duplicating bits would be a very wasteful strategy if you can add significantly fewer bits and achieve the same result which is what you get with error correction techniques like ECC. Maybe they got it confused with logic circuits where there’s not any more efficient strategy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, they managed to make a website that scales everything except the main text when adjusting the browser's zoom setting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the paper they are referring to was published August 27, 2024https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13687&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215910</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the life and career of songwriter and musician Jim Croce, whose hit songs, particularly "Time in a Bottle," achieved immense commercial success, surpassing even The Beatles in sales at one point. Despite this achievement, Croce remains relatively unknown compared to other music legends, largely due to his tragic death in a plane crash shortly after reaching peak popularity. The piece delves into Croce's background, his musical style, the impact of his short-lived career, and the lingering questions about why he hasn't been more widely recognized in music history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NeuralDEM project focuses on integrating deep learning techniques with digital elevation models (DEMs) to enhance terrain analysis and interpretation. It presents a method for generating high-resolution DEMs using neural networks, aiming to improve accuracy in geographical and environmental studies. The website outlines the methodology, provides code implementations, and showcases various applications and results from the research, highlighting the advantages of leveraging artificial intelligence in topographic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some previous work by some of the same people [0] where I was taking part in. Seems like this is a significant step up from the previous work including a novel idea that resolves quite a few issues we had. Love to see that.[0]: https://ml-jku.github.io/bgnn/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is nice, but I believe a simpler design could work better.Simply make a model which transforms a 3d section of an image to an embedding vector.   Make another model which can reverse the process (ie. encoder-decoder).  Do that for every tile of a starting state.Make an 'upscale' and 'downscale' model which can take a grid of embedding vectors and return a new vector representing the whole.Then make an 'advance time' model, which takes an embedding vector and advances time by a given number of seconds/microseconds/days.Now train all the models end to end to ensure that all combinations of upscaling/downscaling/advancing/encoding/decoding produce similar outputs to traditional physics models.Use an ensemble of models or a sampling scheme to find places where outputs do not closely match, and insert more training data from the physical simulation at those points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I wonder what parts of this approach could be adapted to DEM models of solids. For those unaware - even though DEM is naturally chosen for fluids, depending on how you configure the force laws between particles you can easily model solids as well, where each particle is essentially a chunk of material. There are then some interesting choices to make about (a) what kind of lattice you set the initial particles up in, and (b) how you tune the force flaws to get the macroscopic properties you want around stiffness, etc and (c) if you use multiple “types” of particles forming a composite etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145735</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a Linux malware variant named Wolfsbane, which is associated with the Gelsemium malware family, previously known for targeting Windows systems. It provides insights into the functionality and behavior of Wolfsbane, highlighting how it mimics the capabilities of its predecessor, Gelsevirine. The research details the infection process, propagation methods, and potential targets, as well as the implications for cybersecurity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like their malware relies on a couple of things:- intended target is KDE and GNOME- privilege escalation through LD_PRELOAD hooking from userland via open, stat, readdir access (of any other program that the user executes, see down below)- persistence through display manager config for KDE- persistence through desktop autostart files for GNOME- fallback persistence through .bashrc,  profile or profile.sh in /etc- installs trojanized ssh client version- installs a JSP webshell- sideloads kernel module as libselinux.so and .ko module. Probably the rootkit helpers to access them from userlandDespite the snarky comments in here, this malware is actually quite sophisticated.If you don't agree, I challenge you now to measure the time it takes for you to find all .so files on your system that are loaded right now, and have been modified since your package manager installed them.My point being that there is no EDR on Linux that catches this (apart from ours that's WIP), because all existing tools are just checking for windows malware hashes (not even symbols) as they're intended for linux fileservers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I am skimming this correctly, this is a C&amp;C client allowing remote control over the network, and uses "a rootkit" for further compromise once it somehow gets installed?I understand the value of in-depth security reports, but the 5th time they told me "WolfsBane is the Linux counterpart of Gelsevirine, while FireWood is connected to Project Wood." I was wondering when I'd get to the meat and potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These things always get really cool names, like "Wolfsbane" and "firewood". makes me want to make some malware to see what cool name security researchers give it lol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42208580</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting.  Goed gedaan!Note the title of the book should be Een Waarlijk Vrije; i.e. the last word has a j.Curious that DeepL translated "Gaf geen kamp" to "gave a camp", since "geen" means no/none.  It seemed to totally ignore it or reverse it's meaning.Regarding "droving" perhaps "herding" might be a more familiar term.  And it might be more accurate; I suspect that long distance herding wasn't a common thing in the Netherlands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve got my great-grandfather’s autobiography and one of the striking features is the language. It’s extremely matter of fact with very little prose to connect his life together, just a lot of details like “moved to X in year Y” and “went to school for X between Y and Z years”. It’s got a lot of facts, but little coherent narrative.If someone is important enough to warrant a biographer they’ll put more work into the narrative but old autobiographies seem to be very mechanical records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great read ! My father has published 12 books in his native language, I am in process of converting them in English using chatgpt.

Fun blast to the past: https://indieweb.social/@winampskins@botsin.spacePotentially a small correction, I think the 'new' skins were introduced with Winamp 3 not 5. 5 was released because 3 was disliked, and incorporated both features from 2 and 3 (2+3 = 5)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reviewed 1000s of skins and plugins at nullsoft before aol so many of them tie to a time in my life.

Apparently it’s media. Maybe it’s a headless browser that can capture inputs and stream them?Re reading the readme and trying to figure out what each discrete part does made me realize it feels like if ChatGPT had designed a generic, non descript product, and made a readme. It’s got a file that tells me there are things in it. The code does stuff. This is definitely what a product looks like to a human.Philip K Dick described that to see information is to be consumed by it. This feels exactly that way. Presented with something that has just enough meaning to feel “figure out able“.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand what this does.  It says it "broadcasts media content retrieved from web pages".What does broadcast mean?  Like what if the media is a PDF or a PNG?  Is it a static file proxy server?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the use case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210022</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the enduring impact of Fyodor Dostoevsky on literature and philosophy, highlighting key elements that contribute to his immortality as a writer. It discusses his profound psychological insights, exploration of existential themes, and complex characters, which resonate with readers across generations. The author emphasizes how Dostoevsky's work addresses universal human experiences, moral dilemmas, and the search for meaning, making it relevant even in contemporary society. His ability to delve into the darker aspects of human nature and the struggle for redemption further cements his legacy as a pivotal figure in literary history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nabokov's recommendations: http://wmjas.wikidot.com/nabokov-s-recommendationsI love Dostoevsky too much and am quite happy in my bias and echo chamber of that—he was one of the writers that I read in my early days, and to date, I feel that he changed a lot in me or resonated so much that I can't explain.I believe Nietzche said this about him "the only psychologist from whom I had something to learn."And one of my favorite quotes by him:For, after all, you do grow up, you do outgrow your ideals, which turn to dust and ashes, which are shattered into fragments; and if you have no other life, you just have to build one up out of these fragments. And all the time your soul is craving and longing for something else. And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking in these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Substack post is a summary of an essay by Joseph Brodsky about Dostoevsky — but the post does not link or name the essay.The essay is named "The Power of the Elements" and it can be read here on Google Books:https://www.google.com/books/edition/Less_Than_One/N5Nzm2uih...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite course I took in college was a Russian Literature elective my first semester. I fell in love with Dostoevsky when we read Crime and Punishment and I ended up writing my 25 page term paper on him and his role in the proto-existentialist vs nihilism movement in Russia in the 1860s. There will always be a part of me that wishes I had taken my career in that direction instead of computers :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214331</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The document explores the intersection of L-systems, which are formal grammars used to model the growth processes of plants, and their application to music composition. It discusses how these systems can generate musical structures and interpretations, allowing for innovative approaches to musical creation. The paper examines various methods of translating the complexity and patterns found in L-systems into musical elements, highlighting examples and potential applications in both composition and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

IIRC, even if Android allows creating only one window per activity, this behavior can be easily mapped on the abstraction that you provide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was added to raylib as a backend recently: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases#:~:text=RGFW&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42217535</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liquidsoap is amazing. I've done a number of small radio projects with it and friends over the years, including some wild things like mixing 10+ remote drone musicians together into a single feed with just liquidsoap behind icecast and I don't feel like I've begun to scrape the surface of what it can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I admittedly misread the title and thought that some people are creatively repurposing this audio streaming program for transferring IQ datastreams for Software defined radio (SDR) receivers... It may be actually doable with some hacking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never quite got to fix my issues with firefox stopping playing my radio stream after changing songs. It just happens occasionally though I haven't tried recently to see if the problem is still there. At some point I thought liquidsoap cured this but it didn't. Also when I was into that, I got the feeling most of the internet didn't care about radio streams anymore since video streaming is the standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182557</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has introduced a feature for Amazon S3 called Express One Zone Append Data Object, designed to enhance performance and flexibility when appending data to objects in a single Availability Zone. This new capability allows users to efficiently add data to existing S3 objects without needing to rewrite the entire object, thanks to its support for concurrent appends. The update is particularly beneficial for applications requiring frequent data updates, while maintaining cost-effectiveness and simplicity. This enhancement reinforces Amazon S3's position as a robust solution for data storage and management in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrote some notes on this here: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/22/amazon-s3-append-data/Key points:- It's just for the "S3 Express One Zone" bucket class, which is more expensive (16c/GB/month compared to 2.3c for S3 standard tier) and less highly available, since it lives in just one availability zone- "With each successful append operation, you create a part of the object and each object can have up to 10,000 parts. This means you can append data to an object up to 10,000 times."That 10,000 parts limit means this isn't quite the solution for writing log files directly to S3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The original title is "Amazon S3 Express One Zone now supports the ability to append data to an object" and the difference is extremely important! I was excited for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For comparison, while GCS doesn't support appends directly, there's hacky but effective workaround in that you can compose existing objects together into new objects, without having to read &amp; write the data. If you have existing object A, upload new object B, and compose A and B together so that the resulting object is also called A, this effectively functions the same as appending B into A.https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/composite-objects#appe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211280</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of traits in programming, particularly in the context of Rust and other languages, suggesting that while they provide useful structure and reusability, they can also become a limiting factor in design. The author argues that traits should not be viewed as the ultimate solution for code organization but rather as a local maximum that can restrict creativity and flexibility in programming. The piece encourages developers to explore alternative paradigms and structures that may lead to more innovative solutions, rather than relying solely on traits.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the problem of ad hoc polymorphism so interesting. It’s clearly a desirable feature, but we’ve been trying for nearly fifty years and still don’t have a solution that everyone’s unambiguously happy with. Compare that to, like, lexical scoping or parametric polymorphism, which most languages just have by default at this point. They’re almost mathematical facts.And you’d hope there’d be a way to do it. Parametric polymorphism feels underpowered if you can’t make any assumptions about the things you’re abstracting over. But it might be a Halting Problem-esque situation.FWIW if a real, near-trade-off-free solution exists, I think it’ll require a bit of a Copernican revolution in how we approach things. I don’t have any real insight to offer there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What an excellent write-up, and very entertaining at that.I suspect that most devs will prefer the local maximum that traits are.  Perhaps with a bit more help to ensure there's only ever one implementation of a given trait -- think of a trait registry.  One might still allow multiple implementations, but with one single one chosen at final link-edit time or, if linking dynamically, at run time.  To support something like that the registrations in the trait registry would have to be exacting as to each trait's semantics.  A registry has its own cost: friction, and someone has to be a registrar, and registration might have a cost.  But a registry has its advantages, and one could have namespaced traits, too, to enable multiple registries/registrars.  Registries might feel like a hack, but so what, compared to the problems with implicits, they might be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust just doesn’t really have linker errors.After 8 years of programming ~exclusively in Rust it’s easy for me to take this for granted by forgetting that linker errors even exist — until I am rudely reminded by occasional issues with C/C++ code that ends up in the dep tree.This property is downstream of the orphan rules, and given the benefit I wouldn’t give them up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177984</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fun part is that in some cases just listing the iptables rules with an iptables -L will cause it to load the conntrack module and the default max for this is very low for anything that is a DNS server or perform a lot of DNS lookups.   That's why it's a good idea to always set the sysctl nf_conntrack_max value quite high even if you aren't using conntrack.  The actual sysctl key for nf_conntrack is different depending on the version of the kernel, it's net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a terrible website. It moves the viewport around and interferes with scrolling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like bad advice, I don't know why ISC is pushing this...  they would be better off trying to make DNS a TCP-only service to stop amplification attacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42207893</guid></item><item><title>35.

I "beta tested" the tunnel a few times before it opened.One bug we discovered was that it was common for us in the South-East of England to travel regularly over to France, fill our cars up to breaking point with duty-free booze and cigarettes and come home. The problem with the Chunnel trains is that the cars enter at one end and drive through the train. On the way back from France none of our cars could get over the "hump" between the coaches.
They look flat now, so they must have reengineered them:https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ins...Second bug was getting out halfway through and walking through the fire escape tunnels. They have a PA system for the fire crews to issue instructions. But it has a 26 mile long echo. So you can't hear anything.https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaguarcarsmena/43994120214/in/...https://www.theheritageportal.co.za/sites/default/files/styl...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I reading this right? Is the only protocol being supported now the most recent version of IRC? Are there plans for others? Part of Pidgin's "calling card" has been its ability to support many different chat protocols. However, that's become difficult since most protocols have become walled gardens and harder to reverse engineer. I'd imagine supporting Matrix, XMPP, Signal, other protocols with open specifications, etc. would be a good idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to see pidgin still alive and kicking!I hate to have different apps for similar stuff and I also prefer "native" clients over web UIs so I used pidgin a lot in my life. I impressed many people with its "telepathic" feature that would open a chat when someone starts typing, to let you type in something before they even finish their initial sentence. Fun times…However, when I finally got a smartphone, and started a more conventional line of work which came with extra devices, I switched to grouping my chats using server-side gateways for better multi-device consistency. I started by using Spectrum [1] which leverages on libpurple (pidgin's "backend") to do that. Since spectrum is on life support (maintenance mode, no modern chat features like emoji reactions which I happen to like despite my old age), I actually started my own hobby project [2], because I'm not really interested in learning C++ (which spectrum is written in). (shameless plug, I know)The hype these days is more around mautrix [3], but the permacomputing enthusiasth in me prefers XMPP over Matrix. I'm not that religious about it though, my gateway project includes the most feature-rich XMPP/Matrix gateway out there [4] which I try to improve and maintain when time and motivation allow it. Unfortunately, XMPP support in pidgin has historically been pretty poor and IMHO partly responsible for some of the hate XMPP gets. I'm not blaming the pidgin devs of course, I should contribute to libpurple-xmpp (if that's how it's called) instead of complaining. ^^[1] https://spectrum.im/

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a decision by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that classifies Apple as a "bank-like" entity due to its expanding financial services, such as Apple Pay and the Apple Card. This new designation means that Apple will be subject to additional regulations and oversight similar to traditional banks, including protections for consumers relating to fees and reporting. The move reflects the increasing intersection of technology and finance, emphasizing the need for regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

It's Apple, Google and Amazon, PayPal, Block, Venmo and Zelle.[1] Everybody with over 50,000,000 transactions annually gets CFPB oversight. Actual rule: [2]This doesn't really do much. It creates no consumer rights. It does give CFPB examiners the power to examine records and interview people. It means that numbers such as how many PayPal customers have complaints will be looked at. Bank examiners look at error rates, fraud losses, unresolved complaints, and such. The effect will probably be that some of the big players with weak customer service will have to get their act together.[1] https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-final...[2] https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_final-rul...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's written like it's a strange thing:&gt; role is normally limited to banks and financial services companies.Was anyone expecting a system that handles 6 trillion dollars a year to not fall under financial regulatory purview?Which I realise is not the actual thrust of the rule change (obviously they were already under some regs already), but it's just such an odd intro.Apple withdrawing Pay Later when it became clear they'd need to comply with lending regs is quite telling too. Presumably they were attempting to sneak in the back door and claim "it's tech not banking" and got told they're not above the law when the Truth in Lending Act was confirmed to cover the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who runs an actual bank, the headlines around this story are super misleading. In no meaningful way will be Apple be treated like a bank in the way that we generally expect banks to be treated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211525</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is well-written and a potentially good application for crypto-shredding, which has a lot of drawbacks in other contexts.The issue with crypto-shredding in many applications is that it aggressively pessimizes the software architectures possible in support of the data model. For things like databases and analytics, that feature increases the required hardware footprint -- compute and storage -- by orders of magnitude. The loss of efficiency has little to do with the crypto per se, since hardware support makes that cheap, but with how the change in representation interacts with idiomatic data structures and algorithms for high-efficiency data systems.Many system internals are essentially a bag of tricks for constructing the maximally compressive representation of the important relationships in a data model while preserving practical tractability of operations over the data model. Crypto-shredding architectures have the effect of "encrypting" before "compressing", rendering the latter moot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that “PII” is American terminology, and it has a much more restricted meaning than the European term “personal data”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m confused about the purpose of truncating the salt.How does the attacker learn anything about the salt without breaking Argon2id first?  It’s not like the salt is included in the Sigsum ledger.If the attacker did somehow learn the salt (truncated HMAC), it seems like that would immediately break security, regardless of truncation.  Suppose the attacker starts with a dictionary of all possible Actor IDs, which seems reasonable, and that they calculate the truncated HMAC for every possibility until it matches.  Due to the truncation, the attacker may get one or more false username matches in addition to the true username match.  But if the attacker has narrowed down the username to two or three possibilities, they’ve already basically won.  And they could just check the possibilities against Argon2id to learn which one it is.On the other hand, if the attacker doesn’t know anything about the salt, then why would it matter if the salt did uniquely identify a user?  How would they “observe that the recent-merkle-root is the same for two messages, but their salts differ”?It’s quite possible that I’m misunderstanding something.  I am not a cryptography expert.But more broadly, it just seems wrong to use a salted password hash but have the salt be based on the same password that’s being hashed.  I don’t think it’s _insecure_, because the salt also includes a high-entropy part (the recent-merkle-root).  But I don’t see how it increases security at all.  The security should be the same as if the salt only included the high-entropy part.In other words, the entire “HMAC -&gt; truncate -&gt; Argon2id” process can be seen as a password hash in its own right, where the input consists of the secret username, plus various bits of public information such as the recent-merkle-root.  But that’s essentially a form of rolling your own crypto, and it’s unnecessary.  Argon2id is already a secure password hash by itself, so you can just feed that data directly to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210605</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the proposed PrevAIL Act, which aims to amend the U.S. patent review system. It argues that the act would undermine the effectiveness of the current system by making it harder to challenge unjust patents, thereby favoring patent holders and corporations over innovation and competition. The authors express concern that the changes could lead to an increase in frivolous patents and a decrease in the overall quality of patents, ultimately harming consumers and the tech industry. They urge policymakers to recognize the importance of maintaining a robust patent review process to protect fair competition and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that surprised me the most about it is that FedEx didn't just pay them the 400k for lost shipment. They had all the proof that it was lost, all that Fedex had was a signature of someone who doesn't even work at their fulfilment centre. Even after their "higher ups" got involved all that FedEx could do was "huh, sucks to be you I guess?" Does freight shipment not have insurance? What's going on here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to buy a playdate when they first came out, but unfortunately they weren't shipping to my country.Now they do, so I just placed an order 15 mins ago and my partner just received a call from the bank to verify that it wasn't a fraudulent transaction.She just asked me - what is this "play date" you just sent $300 to? Oh dear. :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting choice to go with a PI who's focused on recovery rather than criminal convinctions. Given the lack of sophistication in this operation, I suspect recovery would have happened either way, and the thieves might have faced some actual consequences. As is, they didn't lose anything other than the stolen items and will likely continue to capitalize on similar opportunities in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211689</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of the "Birthday Paradox," which demonstrates how counterintuitive probability can be when assessing chances of shared birthdays among a group of people. It breaks down the calculations to show that in a group of just 23 individuals, there is a surprisingly high 50% chance that at least two people will share the same birthday. The analysis includes visual representations and interactive elements to help illustrate the mathematical principles behind the paradox, emphasizing how human intuition often underestimates such probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analog of the birthday paradox that gets me all the time is what I think of as The Locker Room Paradox. This is where when I go into the locker room after working out and the guy who comes in behind me ends in the locker right next to mine. So there’s two of us in a big empty room awkwardly jostling away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the fact that it's using the previous user birthdays. Unfortunately today is my birthday and I think a lot of people are entering today's date as their birthday, I got 6 matches... :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit confused. Maybe i did not pay enough attention but... Does it stop the first simulation when there are _any_ 2 people with a same birthday, or when someone has _my_ birthday? I think the latter will take more people on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211188</guid></item><item><title>43.

The ball pythons were cramped together in a tiny enclosure with no enrichment, red light that bothers them, no cover or clutter, nothing to climb, no way to burrow, etc.Not exactly a test of whether they are 'social' and frankly it's cruel. Those animals are in so much stress that no data gathered is useful.Now, if you made a giant vivarium with plenty of space for each, things to climb, substrate to burrow in, etc, would they still choose to congregate? That would be a more interesting experiment. But unfortunately, the answer would most likely be 'no'.There definitely are some social snakes out there. Garter snakes, for example, are very well known to form colonies and do much better together than alone.But 'forcing' this conclusion for other species by putting snakes in this situation is awful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free link:https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/science/ball-pythons-soci...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138313</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is aiming to block Google's proposed acquisition of Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup, citing concerns that the deal could stifle competition in the rapidly evolving AI sector. The department argues that the merger would consolidate Google's dominance and potentially hinder innovation, leading to a less competitive market. This action is part of a broader scrutiny of tech mergers and acquisitions, reflecting ongoing regulatory challenges that major tech companies face in maintaining their market positions while fostering competition.&lt;/p&gt;

Which really sucks because Google is the only big tech company that I haven't had negative interactions with.  Using Apple and MS products feels like constant friction to try "force" me into their ecosystem.  Whereas with Google you can just use a product, have it work with any device, any OS, across devices and you're never forced into anything else.The DOJ also seems to be going way beyond their mandate in saying Google monopolizes search and ads.  If the Microsoft precedent is anything to go by, just require Android users to choose a browser and search engine, allow other ad companies to bid on showing ads on search results or something, that seems fair.But forcing them to sell Chrome, open proprietary algorithms to competitors and divest from business parnerships is way over the top and really, really feels like the government is doing a favour to Microsoft and Apple.  Maybe Google didn't cooperate enough on something classified?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This proposal seems like a powerful subsidy for Microsoft and OpenAI.  Why can they partner while Google and Anthropic can't?  It is strange to penalize a non-monopoly partnership like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;http://archive.today/Hm8f6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210560</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Ontopia explores the concept of Topic Maps, a standard for knowledge representation that facilitates the organization and retrieval of information. It delves into the theoretical foundations of Topic Maps, including their structure, components, and practical applications in various fields such as information management and semantic web technologies.

It paid well though, and I could attend conferences around the world.As for the usefulness of the Topic Maps, Mind Maps and ontologies in general... they are useful instantly for the person who composes them as a way to organize thoughts. Pretty much what Notion, Evernote etc are doing, but with much less elegance.They are utterly useless as a way to share knowledge.Also, even 20 years ago, the field was full of old farts wasting everyone's time and consuming salaries. I doubt it changed for better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To this day, topic maps still provide me with my go-to (meta) model.Topic maps truly provide a straightforward organizational metaphor. The foundational topic maps concept —comprising topics, occurrences, and associations— achieves a balance between simplicity and clarity while offering sufficient structure. This allows you to effectively translate your mental model of a domain into a corresponding topic map representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211685</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;"Against the Dark Forest" explores the themes of personal struggle and resilience through the lens of a fantasy narrative. The story features a protagonist who confronts overwhelming darkness and adversity, symbolizing internal battles and the journey towards self-discovery. It delves into the importance of hope, courage, and the transformative power of facing one’s fears. The narrative is rich in imagery and metaphor, inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences with challenges and the light that can emerge from confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real talk. The disdain engineers have toward the "soft sciences"[sociology, psychology] enables them to manipulated into building systems which reproduce and reinforce social structures and social relations in ways that they would otherwise object to.To the degree that we've collectively built a dark forest, it's been in part due to this lack of multi-disciplinarianism.Humans are amazingly adept at rationalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI, bots, and the constant need to fuel training, turns the internet forest into a place where anything a person publishes will be vampirically consumed, mimicked to see whether it can replicate whatever value could be had, and capitalized on if possible or ignored if not.It’s an interesting contrast to actual dark forest theory—-AI doesn’t want to destroy us, so we don’t need to hide for existential sake. But imagine walking outside and as soon as you do, innumerable copies of you spring up, and each action and sound you make is replicated and amplified. Like a weird Phantom Tollbooth meets Alice in Wonderland on DMT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article attempts to bite off a lot! I'm going to condense it down to one small part.The Dark Forest experience that's causing "mass migrations" on the Internet is that, if you venture out into social media carelessly, you're entering an aggressive and frequently unpleasant space which is close to the opposite of "fun" for the average person. Here follows a laundry list here of things which you might expect to encounter in an unpleasant online space, most of which have a kind of tabloid quality: scams, nonstop sales pitches, porn, extreme violence, celebrity worship, ideological extremism, racism, sexism, etc. And more (that list is not exhaustive).So people find that signing up for the average generic platform that welcomes everybody is a bad experience, and migrate to more niche ones. That's been the path I've followed too, all the way here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42217484</guid></item><item><title>47.

This was very effective and over time others would start responding saying my extension had whatever feature they were asking, capitalizing on how relatively slow companies are to implement features.This does rely on the extension having a site it operates on and having a forum for users though. If I were to do it today I'd focus on finding places where my extension's users concentrate, Discord, a community Slack, or otherwise, and doing the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built 2 popular extensions:1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Do they merely memorize training data and reread it out loud, or are they picking up the rules of English grammar and the syntax of C language?This is a false dichotomy. Functionally the reality is in the middle. They "memorize" training data in the sense that the loss curve is fit to these points but at test time they are asked to interpolate (and extrapolate) to new points. How well they generalize depends on how well an interpolation between training points works. If it reliably works then you could say that interpolation is a good approximation of some grammar rule, say. It's all about the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big thread at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34474043&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idk from when even id this article?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an AI Art Turing Test where participants were tasked with creating art pieces that could potentially fool viewers into believing they were created by humans. It emphasizes evaluating both the artwork's quality and the subjective opinions of the judges on whether they can distinguish between human and AI-generated art.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the comment made by the author's friend captures a lot of my feelings on AI art. AI art is often extremely detailed, but that detail is often just random noise. It's art that becomes worse and makes less sense the more carefully you look at it.Compared that to human art. When a person makes a highly detailed artwork, that detail rewards looking closely. That detail forms a cohesive, intentional vision, and incentivizes the viewer to spend the time and effort to take it all in. A person could spend hours looking at Bruegel's Tower of Babel paintings, or Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights".Overall, I've never felt the need to spend the time looking closely at AI art, even AI art that I couldn't tell was AI right away. Instead of rewarding close inspection with more detail, AI art punishes the viewer who looks closer by giving them undecipherable mush.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can't really draw many conclusions from this test, since the AI art has already been filtered by Scott to be ones that Scott himself found confusing. So What do any of the numbers at the end of this really mean? "Am I better than Scott at discerning AI art from human" is about the only thing this test says.If you didn't filter the AI art first, people would do much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fine art is a matter of nuance, so in that sense I think it does matter that a lot of the "human art" examples are aggressively cropped (the Basquiat is outright cut in half) and reproduced at very low quality. That Cecily Brown piece, for example, is 15 feet across in person. Seeing it as a tiny jpg is of course not very impressive. The AI pieces, on the other hand, are native to that format, there's no detail to lose.But those details are part of what make the human art interesting to contemplate. I wouldn't even think of buying an art book with reproductions of such low quality--at that point you do lose what's essential about the art work, what makes it possible to enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42216694</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores various unexpected sources of code execution in Bash, highlighting potential security risks. It discusses how certain commands or shortcuts, like process substitutions and the use of command substitutions, can lead to unintended command execution. The author provides examples to illustrate these concepts, emphasizing the importance of understanding how Bash interprets different inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities in scripts. Overall, the piece serves as a cautionary guide for developers on the subtleties of code execution in Bash.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, there's a lot of gotchas in Bash like this. A lot of them are documented here: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls, including the `test -v` case, which is #61. Some more code execution pitfalls are documented here: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming/05?action=show&amp;r... including the `-eq` part (under Arithmetic Expansion).Basically, the -v case was by design, so for `-v 'hash[$key]'`, "$key is expanded before the array subscript evaluation, and then the whole array plus expanded index is evaluated in a second pass". "Newer versions of bash (5.0 and higher) have a assoc_expand_once option which will suppress the multiple evaluations"Note that the `-v` case doesn't really work the way one may infer from reading the OP:&gt;  $ key='$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)'&gt;  $ [[ -v 'x[$key]' ]]&gt;  bash: $(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned): syntax error: operand expected (error token is "$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)") *&gt;  [[ -v "${x[$key]}" ]]&gt;  bash: $(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned): syntax error: operand expected (error token is "$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yuck, I was always instinctively put off by [[, now I finally have some arguments to justify it.IMO safe shell scripting is kind of dead. I can do it if I really have to, but too many external programs have tricky "convenience" features like interpreting flags after positional parameters, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many footguns in bash. When do we finally get serious about ditching this language as an industry in the same way we are about memory safety?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212700</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the journey of building a compiler, emphasizing the importance of understanding programming languages, computer architecture, and formal language theory. It explores key components of a compiler including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The author shares insights into common challenges faced during the compilation process and illustrates concepts with practical examples and analogies. The intent is to inspire readers to appreciate the complexities of compiler design and motivate them to experiment with creating their own compilers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In software development it's pretty important to know when to build "on top" of something else, and when to start from scratch.Lots of developers will find it much more interesting, challenging, rewarding and just plain fun to develop something from scratch, even when there are better things that already exist.They'll cleverly manipulate and convince the boss, against the better discretion of their elder developers, that they can do it, and if they're one of the better developers, the boss won't want to risk losing them so they'll agree to the escapade.Then said escapade turns into a shambles, as predicted by the elder devs, and the developer who created the mess simply quits and moves to some other job, in search of more fun and greener pastures. Any developer with decades of experience has probably seen this same pattern multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen this a lot when someone wants to add "workflow automation" or "scripting" to their app. The most success I'd had is embedding either Lua or Javascript (preferably Lua) with objects/functions from the business domain available to the user's script. This is what games do too. I think it's a great way to dodge most of the work. For free you can support flow control, arbitrary boolean expressions, math, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;old-guy-high-school-glory-days-and-nobody-today&gt;Reminds me of the pain of intentionally building a compiler for Java 2 (subset)  to MIPS compiler by writing out each AST node class by hand. And, I did it twice, once in C++03 with bison and flex and again in Java 2 with CUP and JFlex... each was developed to build and run as a host portably across Solaris (sparc), Linux (x86), HP-UX (68k), SGI (MIPS), and Windows (x86) with compiled with targets run on the SPIM emulator. It did have dead code, dead string, and dead variable elimination, but that was as far my optimization passes went. I recall the only build tool I used for each was the portable subset of make without GNU extensions.Speaking of reinventing the wheel, in 1998, I built a flexible almost framework for a "portable" generic installer using Java 2, JWT (native GUI controls), and JNI on Windows to create a program group and desktop shortcut icon. The hilarious part was shipping a full JRE on a CD. It took forever to load but the additional time seemed impressive for  expensive, niche software in a way similar to the now fake "loading..." delayed progress bar.&lt;/old-guy-high-school-glory-days-and-nobody-today&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42186244</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Little known fact is that the SGI 5.6+ (certainly 6) settings controls was the first "electron app".It ran a mozilla process, with CSS1.x to style the controls like Motif. And the Javascript code interacted with the underlying XUL hacks in a manner not much different from WebOS palm used decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I enjoyed 4dwm when I had a sgi, I am not convinced the desktop environment was that great, it did however have a very nice file manager, which I guess is 90% of a desktop environment, so perhaps it was pretty good after all.The best sgi ui innovation, which unfortunately I rarely see anywhere else, was the use of drop pockets, these are drag and drop targets, small squares that are uniformly styled to give the user a hint that dropping something here is useful.I was unable to find a good example with multiple pockets, but for example: when you see that blue square in the file manager, you know you can drop something there and it will try to use it as a path.https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/user-experience-ux/pa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used to be called 5DWM.Also CDE is now open source, being actively maintained, and is still the CDE you remember.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenMPTCPRouter is an open-source project designed to enhance Internet connectivity by utilizing Multipath TCP (MPTCP), which allows for the simultaneous use of multiple network interfaces. The platform aims to provide a robust, flexible solution for improving network performance and resilience, particularly in environments where reliable connectivity is crucial, such as in rural areas or during network outages. It features an easy-to-use web interface for configuration and management, supports various devices, and is geared toward both professional and hobbyist users interested in optimizing their network setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219890"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my last year of university (5 years ago) I took a networking seminar. Each student took a look at a different technology to utilize multiple links for internet data transfers.Initially I was amazed by MPTCP and wondered why it had so little adoption. As I looked into the papers I slowly figured out why. With different links (WLAN, LAN, LTE) their real world characteristics are too different for efficient aggregation. It is the head of line blocking problem times ten.It might be fine as a back up link, but there are other problems like the limit to TCP and middelboxes dropping unknowns packets.
The challenges outnumber the benefits for consumers and in data centers there are other technologies to aggregate links that operate on a level below TCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this for around 6 months now to aggregate a 70 mbit FTTC connection and 150-450 mbit 5G connection; overall it works pretty well. The FTTC connection is the "master" link and it seems is preferred for the first several bytes of the connection, so the latency is better than using the 5G connection directly. This provides a nice balance for general web browsing, as loading web pages is still quite quick and overall download speed is more than either connection alone. In my setup I'd say it's about 80% efficient in terms of aggregating the total download.There are a lot of configuration options and the stability of them can be an issue. I've found using XRay VLESS for the Proxy and Glorytun TCP for VPN to offer the best overall speed and reliability. (Edit: I've disabled SQM too). It's possible to mostly bypass the VPN by enabling proxy UDP over XRay but I found that breaks various bypass rules, e.g. so that Netflix connections always go over 5G, as some content has restriction from being accessed by my VPS data center IP.Port forwarding is also a bit hit and miss; I have configured my 2 WAN routers to use the OMR router as a DMZ and then if I want to play a game, or enable remote access, I will use the bypass feature so that the device's MAC goes through my FTTC connection. UPnP works correctly in this scenario which is handy for consoles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used OpenMPTCPRouter to aggregate 3 LTE connections (via routers connected to directional antenna, with SIM cards from different operators) when I was living in a house in the woods before the war has started I had to leave Russia.
Worked like a charm, giving me up to 180 Mbps or so. May not be that good for aggregating different types of links together, but for using multiple cellular connections it's nearly a perfect solution.
BTW 5G 3GPP specs include MPTCP support, IIRC for aggregating connections going via different gNodeBs (base stations)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219890</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of using GPS technology in the historical context of the year 1565, examining the advancements in navigation and cartography during that period. It discusses how navigators relied on celestial navigation and rudimentary tools rather than modern GPS, highlighting the challenges they faced in exploring uncharted territories. The narrative emphasizes the importance of geographic knowledge and the evolution of navigational methods, showcasing how far technology has come since then and inviting readers to appreciate the historical developments leading to contemporary navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to jump in as a minority voice here. In case anybody is reading the other comments and feeling... alienated.I refuse to accept on-call duties, full stop. If a job posting expects it, I don't apply. If a hiring manager says they have it, I do not accept the offer. If management starts talking about maybe implementing it, I protest. If it becomes enacted, I resign.There is absolutely no situation in which I will ever participate in another on-call shift. I've been there, I've done it, now that chapter of my life is closed. Find some younger kid, pay them better than you paid me for the miserable intrusion on their life. I'm done.Just wanted to be the voice who says what, hopefully, some of the more seasoned and battle-scarred readers here are thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My team does Wednesday to Wednesday for many of the same reasons mentioned in the article, and it works great. We switch at 11am and hold a hand-off meeting at that time, and invite the whole team.Hand-off meetings with the whole team work really well (in my opinion!) when you have a relatively small team--we have 9 FT teammates. Often someone else may have been delegated the page or bug that arose and can discuss how they handled it, or someone who wasn't involved may have insight for how to handle a situation better the next time. Since we're all going to be on rotation at least once during a quarter, it's great to know what happened in case a similar page pops up later.Finally, we also fill out a running Doc before/during the meeting with links to the pages/bugs, along with short descriptions of how they were handled. This forms a great living memory of how to deal with incidents, and is also often the birthplace of new playbooks for handling new types of incidents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here in France, we have strict laws, and on-calls MUST be paid in some form or another. When we were bought by a US company, mgmt tried to set up on-call shifts for us - we had never needed them for the 10 years prior -, until they learnt of labor laws and went "fuck it, you're on call mon-fri, 10am - 6pm". I'm forty, have a family, and no amount of money could justify that I can't shutoff my phone at night, or prevent from going on a walk on weekends because "uptime". I've never been so glad of french worker protections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42189336</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, the modern version of the intro networking book we (UC undergrad computer science) had 20 years ago is Computer Networks 6th ed. by Tanenbaum.If you want a programming language to really dig into parsing and creating packets and binary data, Erlang (and Elixir), while a completely different programming paradigm daunting to novice users, are unmatched (pun intended) in generating and parsing binary packets with a native and flexible binary data type.If you want to be able to observe, decode, and inspect real packets on your local network, then you need wireshark and/or tcpdump.If you want a home lab for simulating various networks with various clients, servers, and network devices either XenServer (free) or VMware ESXi (pirated "free" v.7 or maybe v.8) are good options because they simulate dumb virtual switches, virtual networks, and virtual computers (VMs) in another piece of software that replaces a real computer's (usually a server but rarely a desktop or laptop, but also it can run inside a VM on desktop, laptop, or server using what's called a type-2 hypervisor) operating system with its own (type-1 hypervisor). (VMware pre-Broadcom and Citrix engineering cultures had an unspoken, unwritten "gentleman's agreement" that industry-limited pirating was cool so long as it wasn't unreasonable, and product licensing wouldn't break customers' production and would be limited to nags. Comes from the mouth(s) of (a) certain former product manager(s) at one or more of the above entities. Pirating developer use for self-demoing within the industry was a nonzero, unrecognized sales acquisition channel that was probably important in large customer bases but under-appreciated... most engineers/IT people don't want to have to deal with vendor sales/sales engineering meeting free lunches and sit through vendor demos so see if a product trial will work or just to get an installer and a demo license key.)https://search.worldcat.org/title/1085945855PS: I'm wondering if there's retro networking/netadmin homelab community that buys 10 Mbps - 1 GbE Cisco gear and goes through CCIE courseware to see all the old protocols and old problems like spanning tree loops, crossover cables pre auto–MDI-X, and duplex flapping with Intel PRO/1000 in generation 8-9 HP and Dell servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top notch stuff, would love to see a nice explanation of the class based and classes IP addressing.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have successfully cloned two black-footed ferrets using frozen tissues, marking a significant advancement in conservation efforts for this endangered species. This achievement aims to bolster the ferret population, which has dwindled due to habitat loss and disease. The cloning process, which relies on state-of-the-art genetic techniques, offers hope for not only the black-footed ferret but also for other endangered species, illustrating the potential of biotechnology in wildlife conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

(I wonder if this means the clones have mitochondrial DNA from the domesticated ferret egg.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious how many defects creep into the process. I doubt the scientists have any idea, and I'm pretty sure the process involves a great deal of statistical inference to reconstruct the genome from many, many small chunks of DNA.How would they even measure their accuracy? By definition, there's not even a baseline to measure against, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much genetic diversity do you really need?My limited (and likely wrong) understanding of Syrian hamsters is they're all descended from a few specimens someone collected a long time ago. Is there something special in hamsters that prevents genetic issues? Do they not have a lot of recessive characteristics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173292</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the author is reading this, I think a single repository would be more appropriate than multiple repos [1]. It would be nice to set things up so we can simply git pull, docker run, and execute the benchmarks for each language sequentially.Something that stood out to me is the author’s conclusion that "Node.js wins." However, both the Node.js and C++ versions use the same library, uWebSockets! I suspect the actual takeaway is this:"uWebSockets wins, and the uWebSockets authors know their library well enough that even their JavaScript wrapper outperforms my own implementation in plain C++ using the same library!" :-pMakes me wonder if there’s something different that could be done in Go to achieve better performance. Alternatively, this may highlight which language/library makes it easier to do the right thing out of the box (for example, it seems easier to use uWebsockets in nodejs than in C++). TechEmpower controversies also come to mind, where "winning" implementations often don’t reflect how developers typically write code in a given language, framework, or library.--1: https://github.com/matttomasetti?tab=repositories&amp;q=websocke...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their explanation for why Go performs badly didn't make any sense to me. I'm not sure if they don't understand how goroutines work, if I don't understand how goroutines work or if I just don't understand their explanation.Also, in the end, they didn't use the JSON payload. It would have been interesting if they had just written a static string. I'm curious how much of this is really measuring JSON [de]serialization performance.Finally, it's worth pointing out that WebSocket is a standard. It's possible that some of these implementations follow the standard better than others. For example, WebSocket requires that a text message be valid UTF8. Personally, I think that's a dumb requirement (and in my own websocket server implementation for Zig, I don't enforce this - if the application wants to, it can). But it's completely possible that some implementations enforce this and others don't, and that (along with every other check) could make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js (which is C++ with node bindings) outperforms the raw C++ uWebSockets implementation.It's also interesting that https://github.com/websockets/ws does not appear in this study, given that in the node ecosystem it is ~3x more likely to be used (not a perfect measurement but ws has 28k github stars vs uWebSockets 8k stars)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219024</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advantages of using threads over async/await for concurrent programming in Python. It highlights how threads can simplify context management and improve execution, especially in I/O-bound applications, while async/await can introduce complexity and potential pitfalls. The author provides examples and comparisons to demonstrate the efficiency of threads, particularly in scenarios where latency is a concern, suggesting that threads may be a more straightforward solution for many use cases involving concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article seems specific to JavaScript, C# is different.&gt; you cannot await in a sync functionIn C# it’s easy to block the current thread waiting for an async task to complete, see Task.Wait method.&gt; since it will never resolve, you can also never await itIn C#, awaiting for things which never complete is not that bad, the standard library has Task.WhenAny() method for that.&gt; let's talk about C#. Here the origin story is once again entirely differentOriginally, NT kernel was designed for SMP from the ground up, supports asynchronous operations on handles like files and sockets, and since NT 3.5 the kernel includes support for thread pool to dispatch IO completions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_completion_portOverlapped I/O and especially IOCP are hard to use directly. When Microsoft designed initial version of .NET, they implemented thread pool and IOCP inside the runtime, and exposed higher-level APIs to use them. Stuff like Stream.BeginRead / Stream.EndRead available since .NET 1.1 in 2003, the design pattern is called Asynchronous Programming Model (APM).Async/await language feature introduced in .NET 4.5 in 2012 is a thin layer of sugar on top of these begin/end asynchronous APIs which were always there. BTW, if you have a pair of begin/end methods, converting into async/await takes 1 line of code, see TaskFactory.FromAsync.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually think out of any language async/await makes the most sense for javascript.In the first example: there is no such thing as a blocking sleep in javascript. What people use as sleep is just a promise wrapper around a setTimeout call. setTimeout has always created microtasks, so calling a sleep inline would do nothing to halt execution.I do agree that dangling Promises are annoying and Promise.race is especially bad as it doesn't do what you expect: finish the fastest promise and cancel the other. It will actually eventually resolve both but you will only get one result.Realistically in JS you write your long running async functions to take an AbortController wrapper that also provides a sleep function, then in your outer loop you check the signal isn't aborted and the wrapper class also handles calling clearTimeout on wrapped sleep functions to stop sleeping/pending setTimeouts and exit your loop/function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has only written serious applications in single-threaded, or manually threaded C/C++, and concurrent applications in go using goroutines, channels, and all that fun stuff, I always find the discussion around async/await fascinating. Especially since it seems to be so ubiquitous in modern programming, outside of my sphere.But one thing is: I don't get it. Why can't I await in a normal function? await sounds blocking. If async functions return promises, why can't I launch multiple async functions, then await on each of them, in a non-async function that does not return a promise?I get there are answers to my questions. I get await means "yeald if not ready" and if the function is not async "yeald" is meaningless. But I find it a very strange way of thinking nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171693</guid></item><item><title>16.

I've seen butterflies fly in a stiff wind. It seems impossible even when you watch it. I was hoping for some insight into that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most beautiful flying creature imo, they fly almost effortlessly.
I often work remotely in the nature, standing hours in front of my laptop, and sometimes a butterfly or a dragonfly lands on my arm or shoulder, and stays a while. When you think about it, it's probably the safest place for them, since their predators (lizards, ..) don't come close to humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interior of my 3d printed parts has that exact gyroid pattern by the way. They put that in SuperSlicer, and presumably in PrusaSlicer, because it is really easy to print by running wiggly lines along x and y direction.

Nice to see that he gave credit and linked to that thread.I'm a physical design engineer that uses software from Cadence and Synopsys to do chip layout of blocks with billions of standard cells.  Our flow automatically puts antenna diodes in for all block input pins.  Then the tools are usually good enough to breakup internal nets with layer jumping to avoid antennas.Some of the charge also comes from the CMP process.  Modern chips have about 20 layers of metal but there are lots of other via layers in between those and then all the base layers with the actual transistors.  You want the wafer to be flat before building the next layer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical-mechanical_polishing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here: I know this is a very obscure topic, but hopefully it will be interesting to some. Let me know if there are any questions...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact about "antennas" in chip manufacturing: They have nothing to do with actual antennas. Charge can build up on long wires during manufacturing because the chemicals involved are not neutral and have some interactions with exposed wires. That charge needs to go somewhere to protect the rest of the circuits. There's nothing RF about this.Later technologies (28 nm and below) have extensive design rules around prevention of "antenna" effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42223690</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent decision by the University of Oxford to offer contracts to Deliveroo riders to provide tutorial services, highlighting the implications of this move within the gig economy. It raises concerns about the potential undermining of traditional academic staffing structures and the quality of education, as it blurs the lines between full-time academic staff and gig workers.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All UK universities do this. Not necessarily a bad thing unlike how the article portrays it. PhD students (and depending on the institution, postdocs) in the UK get a stipend that has no mandated teaching hours. Teaching allows PhD students to earn some extra income within the university.We certainly still have a compensation problem in academia. Bright STEM PhD grads don't want to earn £30-40k as a postdoc when earning £150k+ in big tech or finance isn't unusual. However, PhD students earning a little side income by marking lab reports or programming assessments isn't necessarily bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is this news? this sounds like every university in the US, which uses underpaid adjuncts to do most of the teaching and underpaid phd candidates and postdocs to do most of the researchnot saying this is right -- adjuncts and postdocs absolutely need to be paid more commensurately with the value they provide -- but it has been the status quo for a long time; the bigger problem is that it used to be a temporary stepping stone to professorship, whereas now universities are perpetually and increasingly relying on this cheap labor to cut costs, making the path for academia an increasingly tortuous one. It's highly counter productive because who wants to go through all that instead if you can get a job in industry that values you much more? The result is that you don't get the best and brightest educating the next generation, except maybe at a few universities - Oxford, Stanford, Harvard, MIT, etc. - where the prestige itself is enough of a draw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems that these days academia is mostly garbage for anyone who wants things like money, family or a healthy work-life balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42163330</guid></item><item><title>19.

Why couldn't I just check the package.json myself?Or is this aimed at LLM's, so you can run a program instead of letting an LLM guess the tech?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could see this being valuable for sales people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171248</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve worked on and finished some extremely large programs over my years in non-tech enterprise. I’m also an external examiner for CS students, and I’ve regularly talked about how I think the curriculum is outdated. In Denmark where I’m from it’s rare to get a programming application from someone without a related degree. It wasn’t so rare 20 years ago, but I can’t remember when I saw one last. I agree that degrees, and especially CS, doesn’t guarantee that people can code. We use them mostly as a “safety net” in our hiring processes here in my region of the world. Basically you can view hiring the wrong person as the most expensive mistake you can make as a manager, and educations are a sort of risk management. You might think that the “can this person actually program” risk is worst for people who are fresh out of their education but there are a lot of factors which can play into it. Older devs may be set in their ways, maybe even religious about some sort of programming philosophy. On the flip side they will start producing value right away.Anyway, by far I think the biggest hurdle in our industry right now is pseudo-jobbers like project managers, business process owners, scrum masters, various architects and what not. Not everyone is a waste of time, some of them do excellent work and function as exponential productivity catalysts. The vast majority of them, however, spend so much time engineering the process, architecture, whatever that their teams never ship on time or within budget. In this sense I think “correct programs” is hard to value. Because often the “incorrect large program” that doesn’t scale, will be much more valuable for a business than a “correct program” which never even gets the chance because it took to long to get out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me strongly of reaching the final year industry projects in my software engineering degree, and seeing a significant portion of my colleagues unable to develop software in any meaningful way.There was a curriculum correction in the years afterwards I think, but so many students had zero concept of version control, of how to start working on a piece of software (sans an assignment specification or scaffold), or how to learn and apply libraries or frameworks in general. It was unreal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a prof (many years ago), I was working on a database for a political campaign. The code was a mess. I asked a couple of my colleagues (successful comp. sci. profs) to help out. It became clear very quickly that there are two kinds of comp. sci. profs: those who can program and those who cannot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171685</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to effectively give feedback to senior leaders while minimizing the risk of negative repercussions. It emphasizes the importance of preparing for the conversation by considering the leader's perspective, using a constructive and respectful tone, and focusing on specific behaviors rather than personal attributes. The piece also outlines techniques for fostering a productive dialogue, such as choosing the right time and place, framing feedback as a conversation about improvement, and being receptive to the leader’s responses. Overall, it aims to empower employees to provide valuable insights in a way that strengthens workplace relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Astonishing. Completely backwards. This article describes how to give feedback to your subordinates, not to your superiors. If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it's feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don't bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don't yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.The reason you don't fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience one of the best ways to "get ahead" is to give direct 1:1 feedback to someone higher up in your management chain for something that you are obviously right about it (some wiggle room here, but be sure to be atleast mostly right on a non-trivial topic). It demonstrates to them that you have good judgement and have backbone. They will trust you more and start to think of you as more of a peer than merely someone in their span of control (obviously you need to do this tactfully / not be a dick about it but also be firm). This has been a huge unlock for my career. ymmv.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Captain Miller: "I don't gripe to you, Reiben. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent bankruptcy of Synapse, a financial technology platform, which has resulted in thousands of Americans losing access to their savings. This situation has raised concerns about the security and reliability of fintech companies and the protections in place for consumer deposits. The article highlights personal stories of individuals affected by the bankruptcy, the implications for the fintech industry, and calls for greater regulatory oversight to safeguard customers’ funds in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked website for Yotta is withyotta.com which looks like some sort of online gambling site? The slogan is "Play games. Win Big." Am I missing something? It doesn't look like something I'd trust to put any amount of money into.Looking at archive.org for September 2023 [1] they claim an "average annual savings reward" of "~2.70%*". At a real major US bank, I was getting 4.65% in my savings account at this same time.Reading the terms at the bottom of the page it says: "Please note that the approximate Average Annual Savings Reward of 2.70% is a statistical estimate based on the probabilities of matching numbers each night. The Annual Savings Reward will vary from member to member depending on one’s luck in the Daily Drawings and is subject to change in the future."[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20230912164609/https://www.withy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did I get this right:1) non-bank fintech put client's money in the bank2) they told clients that money in the bank are covered by FDIC which is technically true3) fintech moved money out of the bank4) bank insurance doesn't apply because the bank didn't "lose" anythingAt least this seems to match the Evolve's part of the story from the article. And Evolve is a real bank so they should have all the records to prove it. If so then it's a clear fraud by fintechs, but FDIC can't do much. Otherwise Evolve is lying and in this case FDIC can take over.I wonder what is a reliable way to know if in the end your money is covered or not. Trusting what the contract tells you is evidently not enough. Having a "real" individual account number in a real bank? Not sure either, if intermediary can move the money out of your personal account then account insurance likely won't work either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like obviously fraud on the part of Synapse/Yotta. Where else could the money have gone? There were no risky investments. The underlying bank didn't collapse. Why isn't there a federal prosecutor on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219407</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing. I liked the short video.These have been around for a few years. Wonder what people built with them since. Anyone know of any popular distributed systems using them nowadays? (I noticed the company the author mentioned shut down https://medium.com/@MeetLima/this-time-its-goodbye-5573a97be...)As an additional resource I liked the description of ITC by Fred Hebert: https://ferd.ca/interval-tree-clocks.html. He is the author of the wonderful Learn You Some Erlang book. There is an ITC library he maintains as well: https://github.com/ferd/interval-tree-clocks, started by Paulo Sergio Almeida.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several things remain unclear:"The beauty of this scheme is that a node only has to know about its share of the interval"The article doesn't explain curve changes in much detail, but I assume it increases the portion of the curve "owned" by the node.With unique identifiers all a node needs to know its identifier. So that can't be what's interesting about these interval portions.Also:- How that curve is initially drawn isn't clear at all. Is it flat and becomes complex over time by forking (+ data modification)?- Why are interval boundaries real-value in a system that cannot actually express real numbers?- How are the intervals / portions decided? Is that simpler than generating UUIDs?- How does comparison work?"Comparison works similarly to Version Vectors: if the curve of a stamp is above the other one, it descends it, otherwise the curves intersect and the stamps are concurrent."But now you have events with curves and intervals where one event might miss a portion. It's not immediately clear what happens in that comparison. It's maybe obvious to some readers but clearly not an audience that needed introduction for the other things initially explained by the article.In terms of conclusions:My understanding is that the main benefit is that the overall complexity of the "vector" becomes simpler in light of actor explosion due to the merging mechanism. Whereas UUIDs (or even monotonous index indexed vectors) would grow indefinitely, making tracking them on events a challenge.This intro article fails to make this stuff clear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interval tree clocks seem really cool, and I’d love to use them for something. But unfortunately I can’t think of a way to reliably have a system automatically subdivide an interval to bring new servers up without getting pathological behaviour sometimes. Or, if an identifier (interval) goes offline indefinitely, I can’t think of any good way to clear it.In practice, vector clocks / version vectors built using uuid identifiers for machines seem easier to work with, and they’re very predictable. Slightly less efficient - but versions take up a tiny percentage of network traffic and disk space that I don’t think it matters.I really want to use interval tree clocks for something. It’s such a cool algorithm. But I don’t know what I’d use them for - beyond maybe a set of manually provisioned servers syncing data or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212543</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is from the SQLite creator D. Richard Hipp who is always worth reading, but, I'd like to recommend reading what TCL's creator John Ousterhout has to say.His article on threads from 1995 was highly influential on me, and I remember it to this day. More recently (2018, revised and expanded in 2021), he published a book on software engineering practices called A Philosophy of Software Design which is, in my opinion, the best in its category.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic TCL principal that "everything is a string". Beginning with SQLite3 (2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.TCL can handle binary data. It is just not a separate type: https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Working+with+binary+dataSQLite also always had a null type, surely?&gt; However, types are still very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL. SQLite treats the datatypes on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than hard requirementsThis is something I do not much like. Its not compulsory (you can create "strict" tables). It works well in TCL which is an entire language designed around the idea. Less so in SQL.One of the advantages of RDBMSes is that not accepting obviously wrong data makes life easier for developers. You can debug an issue that happens on inserting the data, not when you find the wrong type or other bad much later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day, the Tcl conferences (and the EuroTcl in Europe) were great sources of information. Only about half of the presentations were for Tcl internals and extensions. The rest were about other projects that were using Tcl in some way or other, and it was fascinating to learn about completely different areas of software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220078</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of runtime extensible parsers in DuckDB, a database management system. It highlights the flexibility of enabling users to create and integrate custom parsing functions directly into the database’s query handling process. This capability enhances the system’s ability to process various data formats dynamically, providing more efficient and tailored solutions for data ingestion. The authors also illustrate the technical approaches taken to develop this feature, emphasizing its potential benefits for users dealing with diverse data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a practical standpoint, for anyone who needs to parse SQL today, I can recommend datafusion's sqlparser-rs. This is what we use in http://sql-page.com , and I regularly contribute to it. I don't know anything else that matches its level of support for all the crazy little-known syntax particularities of the various SQL dialects.In particular, Microsoft SQL Server seems to do everything just a little bit differently, and sqlparser-rs does support its idiosyncrasies most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The incredible Janet for Mortals book by Ian Henry was my first exposure to peg. It's very interesting and changed my thinking on programming in a big way. It's a free book.https://janet.guide/pegular-expressions/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is nothing wrong with using PEGs for SQL parsing, but this article (I didn't read the paper) presents flawed arguments:- tech $X is from the 60s, therefore it is bad and/or outdated: one doesn't need to "disrupt" or innovate in everything to become modern.  There are plenty of things from the 60s that still don't have a better replacement, and its OK to keep using it.- "YACC-style parsers" clumps together parsers that are generated at compile-time, from declarative grammars, using LALR(1).  But that's not inherit to the technique or algorithm: a parser can be LALR(1) from a declarative grammar and still extensible at run-time, or provide LL(1) alongside, or be built from statements instead of a grammar.  There's nothing wrong with using PEGs over "YACC-style" parsers, but not for these distorted reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213639</guid></item><item><title>29.

FDA officials stress that the levels of inorganic arsenic detected were very low and that continuing to eat chicken as 3-Nitro is suspended from the market does not pose a health risk.&gt; 3-Nitro® (Roxarsone) is an arsenic-based animal drug, manufactured by Alpharma LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. It is approved to help prevent coccidiosis when used in combination with certain animal drugs. Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease that infects the intestinal tracts in poultry and can lead to death in poultry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US owes it to the Vietnamese people to clean up the arsenic, but of course they're never going to do that. I know several elderly Vietnamese who developed leukemia after serving in the war.If you eat rice, please eat white not brown, parboil it with a ratio of 4:1 water to rice, and dump the water afterwards [0].https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The bottom line is that arsenic is a heavy metal, like lead, and all

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of a "tech utopia," highlighting the optimistic vision of a future shaped by advanced technologies that enhance human life and solve global challenges. It discusses the potential benefits of innovations such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and biotechnology, while also addressing the inherent risks and ethical dilemmas these technologies may pose. The piece emphasizes the need for responsible development and governance of technology to ensure that it serves the common good and contributes to a more equitable society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being optimistic and positive on tech in the first place is the root issue here. This reminds me of my mom in medical school who became disillusioned when she experienced the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and it's influence of the entire industry for it's own profit, not always in the interest of the patient.  Being overly optimistic about an industry or field is in my view a worldview error, and a better approach is to be optimistic about one's own potential to contribute to the betterment of humanity, no matter the field.  Also the understanding that there are and always will be bad actors should not dissuade one from being part of creating solutions, as one sees it. Being jaded and cynical will not help in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology is still a good thing.  It's certain tech business models that are the problem.Tech used to be a tool.  I remember participating in product design conversations in the '00s, and the focus was all on "How can we make people's lives better?  How do we create software that makes things more convenient for them, more enjoyable, frees up time and opens up new opportunities for them."Tech is now a means to turn people into tools.  I still sit in product design conversations.  Now they are focused on how to manipulate people into clicking on more ads and opening up their wallet more.  The applied psychology is very advanced, and is more of a focus than the technology now.IMHO, the root cause of this is the advertising + subscription business model, along with the provision of free products to get people hooked and then upsell them on expensive and (in the big picture, but customers can't see the big picture) insconsequential upgrades.  The secret to success in the tech industry is "Demonstrate value.  Nurture dependence.  Threaten to take away features, unless large amounts of money are paid."  In people terms, we call this an abusive relationship, or blackmail.  In the tech industry, it's a very profitable business model.The worst part is this is spreading to other industries like food production and transportation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's worth recalling why that optimism, at least in part.Information wanted to be free, for the first decade of the web's existence. Projects like Linux, Wikipedia, the www itself. These open, free ways of doing things were proving a case for optimism.They were so much faster &amp; better than corporate alternatives that you couldn't help but expecting that open projects had the competitive advantage.Meanwhile, online culture was very different. There was room for morons and blowhards, touts, spammers and occasional shill... but those people didn't run the show.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221937</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quit my FAANG job yesterday to join a fully remote company. I took a &gt;50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I've cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don't hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal.Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, "If you don't like it, find another place to work". The first good advice I've heard from them in 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have heard every possible sentiment about RTO at this point. The post is a well-written spleen vent, and I mostly agree, but I didn’t see anything new in it.But because everyone has an opinion, I’ll share mine:  I like being in the office, sometimes. I hate going to and from the office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s what I view as a common misperception embedded in the article. RTO isn’t about empty real estate, or not mostly. Leases can be broken, everything is subject to negotiation. Sure, there’s a cost, but it could be paid.It’s not about real estate, it’s about power. For a brief period, during the great resignation, executives felt the sting of at will employment, a weapon that was never meant to be used against them. RTO is about showing us all who is really in charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221623</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Japan's recent decision to start releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, which has sparked concerns and backlash from local fishermen and neighboring countries. The government asserts that the water is safe after treatment, but many remain skeptical about the environmental and health impacts. The release is part of a larger effort to manage the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster, but the controversy over safety measures and communication remains a significant issue in public discourse and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a novel method for enhancing the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms by employing a strategy called "distributional reinforcement learning." It introduces a new framework that focuses on modeling the entire distribution of returns, rather than just the expected value, which allows for better decision-making under uncertainty. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, showing improvements in learning efficiency and performance across several benchmark tasks. The findings suggest that considering the distribution of returns can lead to more robust and flexible reinforcement learning agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a concept known as the "simple semi-space collector," a technique used in garbage collection within programming languages. It examines the efficiency of this approach in managing memory by collecting objects that are no longer in use while minimizing the overhead typically associated with garbage collection processes. The author outlines the theoretical foundations of the semi-space collection method, its implementation, and its advantages in preserving performance in applications that require dynamic memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you like reading about GC implementation than keep reading wingo's blog. He's currently being funded by NLnet to finish the Whippet GC library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wingolog blog posts are always such a joy to read (for me at least). The combination of low-level fundamental stuff presented in a simple and accessible way that gets the core idea across is a rare quality.An immediate question I have is whether one could extend compacting GCs to also "sort" or "cluster" the live objects for better cache access in some way (in a practical sense I mean, where the extra runtime overhead is worth it). Also what kind clustering would actually work in that case.I'm guessing naively tracking how often each object is accessed in a certain window of time and sorting by that wouldn't work, since the most accessed objects could be used at completely different times - some sort of "accessed together" algorithm probably makes more sense. But then we're in the territory of a combinatorial explosion of options if we're not careful.Maybe something really stupid would work:    1. use a single global integer
       that increases by one with
       each heap memory access,
    2. assign the counter's value to
       GC metadata of the accessed
       object in question as a sort
       of "time stamp"
    3. during compacting, "sort"
       all living objects by whatever
       they have as their value
       (this is probably really hard)
    4. after compacting, reset counter
       and time stamps

Worst case this would put objects right next to at least two objects that were accessed around the same time.I presume that this question must have been researched to death, does anyone have any suggestions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This approach makes sense if you have access to either all available memory or a fixed quantity of memory, half of which would go to the fromspace and the other half to the tospace. What I don't understand is: When should the heap be made bigger? What about smaller?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42218941</guid></item><item><title>36.

Not quite what I expected, particularly the points about how Sun truly encouraged blogging, so it was interesting in that regard. The many links to older articles help paint a good picture of this story.As for "conclusions"... I also hit the 2-decade mark earlier this year (https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/20-years-of-blogging) and I can spot similar thoughts to mine: blogging has evolved from short/informal posts to longer-form more structured pieces, and the smaller "throw-away" articles that one would write in the past now happen in other platforms like Twitter or Reddit. Which matches... the trend for everyone else too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you blog, do you go back and look at old pieces?I do that occasionally, mostly to reshare on social media or here. Gotta chase those karma points.But sometimes someone will ask a question in slack or via email that reminds me "I wrote something about that once!" and I'll dig up a piece to share.As a gift for a family member who had a non-technical blog, I once gathered posts together, edited them, and turned them into a book. That was a ton of fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article! I am about to reach the five-year mark of blogging (https://pncnmnp.github.io/blog.html) - I started during my second year as an undergraduate. Over the years, I've seen that:* Keeping the blogging stack minimal helps. Using simple tools has helped me focus entirely on the content. For instance, I write everything in Google Docs and then manually convert it to HTML.* It is beyond okay to feel stuck, especially with technical content. I often have several partially written drafts sitting around. Revisiting these drafts periodically helps me see them with fresh perspectives. Eventually, inspiration strikes, and I end up finishing those half-baked drafts.* It helps to avoid obsessing over analytics. I have intentionally avoided analytics, and it has kinda allowed me to focus on topics that genuinely interest me, rather than writing solely to please some imaginary audience. It kind of gives me the freedom to explore obscure subjects, even if they appeal to only a small number of my readers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42172034</guid></item><item><title>37. 9elements Takes over Intel 1st Gen Xeon Scalable Skylake Support Within Coreboot</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/9elements-SkylakeX-Coreboot</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an utterly brilliant hack for dimensionality reduction leading to pattern recognition. That it even beats SVMs (albeit with a single carefully chosen example ;-) is icing on the cake.One thing I don't understand is the addition of the constant 3 to the row index (in the paper just after formula 6). Intuitively this should be only 2, because the last row vector of the local topology lags the last state captured in the distance matrix by one row, and then we want to move ahead one more row to start forecasting.What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;naive question but can forecasting in a time series be applied backward to interpolate it?  in a case like this FReT algorithm, the idea would be that the information in the FReT interpolated series (or SETAR, NNET, etc) would have a higher fidelity to the total information in the sequence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, am I missing something?  "Topology" here just seems to mean connectivity, and I can't even tell why they have a notion of 3x3 connectivity-matrix structure.  A whole lot of this seems under-explained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42222431</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of energy being frame-dependent, illustrating how the measurement of energy can vary depending on the observer's frame of reference, particularly in the context of physics and relativity. It explains that different observers may perceive the same physical scenario differently based on their relative motion and position, leading to varying interpretations of energy. This highlights the importance of understanding the relativity of measurements and perceptions in scientific analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Most likely, the kid had some other upper respiratory tract infection with the symptoms coming from that and the H5 may well have been an incidental finding, especially since they have likely already recovered based on the timeframe I'm aware of. One potential theory is exposure to wild bird droppings.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of the upcoming general election in the UK, emphasizing the importance of voter engagement and awareness of political issues. It highlights key topics that will influence the election, such as the economy, healthcare, and social policies. The writer encourages readers to remain informed, participate in discussions, and make their voices heard during the election process to ensure their concerns are addressed by candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “a 64MB POWER Indigo 2 with XZ Graphics and a 2GB SCSI drive would run you around £58,000”And then you had to buy the software. A license for a 3D modeling package like Softimage or Alias cost at least $10-15k, and you probably also needed a separate raytracing package for high-quality output.Someone is selling a copy of Alias for SGI for $2500 on eBay today:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/335622694059But if, in 1994, you did have an SGI and Alias and enough artistic skill and technical competence (and patience…) to produce liquid logos and dancing soda bottles and face morphs, you would certainly recoup that $80k investment quickly. It was a very rare skill that needed very rare hardware. You could get highly paid freelance work by simply calling up ad agencies.That scarcity a bit hard to imagine today, when anyone can download Blender onto their standard desktop computer and learn it by watching online videos. It’s cool that 3D art has been thoroughly democratized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I miss from that era of machines was just the way they looked: at the time, most machines were grey or black boxes, but the SGIs had some degree of personality to them.  The O2's were fun little curvy boxes.  One of my favorites were the large rack systems - one of my jobs had us working with the Origin 2000 and PowerChallenge machines.  Compared to some of the generic clusters of rack mounted Alpha systems that we had around the same time, the SGIs just had a cool look to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories. Back around the same time in the mid-90’s I remember visiting a post-production company, who had multiple SGI Onyx supercomputers in their stylish glass walled server room, dedicated to processing special effects for film and advertising.They were so expensive they only made sense to run 24/7/365 in order to get their money’s worth. They had a service engineer on call permanently who wasn’t allowed to be further away than 25 miles from the servers at any time.http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/onyxgs.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219411</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;A court ruled that a school acted appropriately when it punished a student for using AI tools in a manner deemed inappropriate. The ruling emphasized the school's responsibility to uphold its policies regarding academic integrity and student conduct, stating that the student was aware of these policies when deciding to use the AI. This decision highlights ongoing debates about the role of technology in education and the boundaries of acceptable use of AI by students.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The parents' case hangs largely on the student handbook's lack of a specific statement about AI, even though that same handbook bans unauthorized use of technology. "They told us our son cheated on a paper, which is not what happened," Jennifer Harris told WCVB last month. "They basically punished him for a rule that doesn't exist."I'm going out on a limb here, but if this is the viewpoint of the people who raised him, then I'm not surprised he cheated.If this was my son and the facts were the same, he'd be grounded in addition to whatever consequence the school deems fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The student was not punished for "using AI", but for plagiarism:&gt;The incident occurred in December 2023 when RNH was a junior. The school determined that RNH and another student "had cheated on an AP US History project by attempting to pass off, as their own work, material that they had taken from a generative artificial intelligence ('AI') application," Levenson wrote. "Although students were permitted to use AI to brainstorm topics and identify sources, in this instance the students had indiscriminately copied and pasted text from the AI application, including citations to nonexistent books (i.e., AI hallucinations)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably unpopular opinion here but families, usually wealthy, that use the legal system like this to avoid consequences are parasites. It reveals not only your poor job of raising your children. But also the poor character of the parents.Glad the courts didn’t grant a similar “affluenza” ruling here. The student plagiarized, short and simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221688</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing trend of "quiet quitting," where employees fulfill only their basic job responsibilities without going above and beyond. This phenomenon reflects a growing desire for work-life balance, driven by factors such as burnout and changing workplace dynamics post-pandemic. The piece explores the implications for employers and employees, indicating that while it may lead to improved employee satisfaction, it could also undermine productivity and long-term career growth. The article emphasizes the need for better communication and understanding between workers and employers to foster a healthier workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rick Dickinson, the Sinclair designer guy, was simply a genius. It helped a lot for the success, the ZX81 and the Spectrum being just beautiful objects.On a side note, I think one of the most iconic manual cover for a computer is the ZX81 one. Designed by John Harris, it's a masterpiece. I think he designed the Spectrum manual too but it was not so great.We had beautiful computers at the time. I would say, in order of appearance, the Atari VCS, the ZX81, the Spectrum, the Commodore C128 and the Amiga 500 (inspired by the C128), the Apple IIc Plus. The original Macintosh eventually. It was just like having a piece of art at home.The Spectrum Next, still designed by Rick, is beautiful too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sinclair devices were popular because they were dirt cheap. A BBC micro was three times the price of a Spectrum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting how one generation basically had the same experience at the same time, but how it varied from place to place.The UK was very into ZX - first the ZX80 and ZX81, and then the Spectrum. For that generation, in the UK, Spectrum is the start of everything.I was an Apple child myself (a function of the machine my dad brought home), a BBC Micro at school (because... education), but in the mid 80s the Apple switched to IBM, and I've been on the PC track ever since.I've met other groups for whom Vic 20, Commodore 64 and especially Amiga hold that first-love status. I'm just blessed to be that generation where the hardware was there at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220062</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a black hole consuming material at an extraordinary rate, 40 times higher than previously thought possible. This finding challenges existing theories about black hole activity and growth, suggesting that these cosmic giants can feed much more aggressively than expected. The study offers new insights into the behaviors of black holes and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution, prompting a reevaluation of our understanding of their feeding mechanisms and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

No singularity at the center of a black hole2. Universe's expansion rate is not constant because it's blackholes powering it with matter3. Eventually expansion slows, stops and reversesAnd now my own crazy ideas:1. Maybe the universe is a inside a black hole2. Maybe the big bang was a result of the birth of another black hole somewhere else, and that the rapid expansion rate of the early universe was due to the a huge amount of matter converted into dark energy by this black hole&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think once we finally get this all sorted out, future humans will find it hilarious that so many people were convinced that dark matter was real and particles we could not detect made up 80% of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220777</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses print debugging as a simple yet effective technique for troubleshooting and understanding code behavior. It explains the advantages of using print statements to reveal the flow of execution and variable values, making it accessible even for novice programmers. The author highlights best practices for implementing print debugging, such as using meaningful messages and strategically placing statements, while also acknowledging its limitations compared to more advanced debugging tools. Ultimately, the post emphasizes print debugging's value in the development process, particularly for quick problem-solving and gaining insights into complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While print-type debugging has a place, the reason there are a lot of articles dissuading the practice is the observed reality that people who lean on print debugging often have incomplete knowledge of the immense power of modern debugging tools.This isn't just an assumption I'm making: years of being in developer leadership roles, and then watching a couple of my own sons learning the practice, has shown me in hundreds of cases that if print-type debugging is seen, a session demonstrating how to use the debugger to its fullest will be a very rewarding effort. Even experienced developers from great CS programs sometimes are shocked to see what a debugger can do.Walk the call stack! See the parameters and values, add watches, set conditional breakpoints to catch that infrequent situation? What! It remains eye opening again and again for people.Not far behind is finding a peer trying to eyeball complexity to optimize, to show them the magic of profilers...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the trickiest bugs to hung down are those involving concurrency and non-deterministic timing.  In these cases, stepping through a debugger is not at all what you want, since you may actually change the timing just by trying to observe.To see the nature of the race condition, just put some print statements in some strategic locations and then see the interleaving, out of order, duplicate invocations etc that are causing the trouble.  It's hard to see this type of stuff with a debugger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with all these 'print debugging is good' and 'print debugging articles are bad' is that none of them provide any context. Print debugging is just one tool in a box full of tools. Pick the right one for the right job. An article that walks through how to make that decision would be very useful. An article that just picks a side in a decades-old debate is just noise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219708</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey reveals that half of young Norwegians consider online piracy an acceptable method to save money, particularly in light of the rising costs associated with streaming services. The study highlights a perception among this demographic that digital content is overly priced and points to a growing trend of prioritizing financial savings over copyright laws. This viewpoint raises concerns for content creators and the entertainment industry, as it suggests a shift in attitudes towards intellectual property rights among the younger population.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corporations make decision that are predatory and then complain when people avoid them. For example, there has been much talk about "bad" passengers on airplanes. But there is little  discussion about the increasingly inhumane people must endure to fly. Somehow the corporations expect people to endure over crowding, exasperating loading conditions, angry and surly "attendants", delays, bad food and more. Then when some passenger loses it, the problem is never the conditions, it is the passenger.The same is true for digital content. Amazon "sells" you movies (as do others like Apple), but do you "own" the movie? No. Amazon can just tell you it is no longer available. You cannot "sell" the movie you "bought" to some other person. But you bought it right? People in general are of good will. But if you treat them as prey at some point they recognize these corporations are simply predators. In my opinion there is a very strong case to be made that people who decide not to be victims are of better character than these predatory corporations.[edit: removed the line "May their travels ever be delayed." because it was not clear I meant predatory corporations]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I could actually buy movies and TV shows for download I would; I buy all my music as sites like bleep.com allow you to easily buy mp3s, probably thousands of dollars over the years. I've tried buying shows a handful of times before. But I travel a lot and they're geolocked - WTF can't I watch my fully paid for episodes of Rick and Morty on youtube wherever I happen to be?Since studios have made purchasing impossible, I don't, and I don't give them any money via streaming services either.There is one exception I can think of: https://www.teamstarkid.com/ They've made their (awesome!) musicals available for purchase, with a true video download. So they've gotten a well-deserved $50 from me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing, so...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182888</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the aestectics, even if physically wrong at the edges. Thanks for sharing the details.As a embedded developer, I feel this is kind of wasteful. Every client computes an "expensive" blur filter, over an over again? Just for blending to a blurred version of the background image?I know - this is using the GPU, this is optimized. In the end, this should not be much. (is it really?)&lt;rant&gt; I feel the general trend with current web development is too much bloat. Simple sites take 5 seconds to load? Heavy lifting on the client? &lt;/rant&gt;... but not the authors fault&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I extracted a similar "light rays" texture from Windows 7 when I was trying to replicate its aero glass effect on Android to see what can be done with the new shader APIs. I ended up with something very close to this article, except I didn't do the inner shadows but I did increase the saturation of the blurred background a bit.https://mastodon.social/@grishka/110524476584503201&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great work, the interactive demo is a good way to show it off too. It’s fun to drag the window over the moon.That said I dislike the use of frosted glass in user interface design, and feel it was a step backwards for Mac OS when it was added. Designers (hypocritically including myself - I use it too sometimes) are so seduced by it. But in practice it’s never ideal.

&lt;p&gt;Bocker is a lightweight, open-source implementation of Docker in Go that serves as a simple alternative for running containers. Its primary aim is to provide a minimalistic and easy way to manage containerized applications without the overhead of using a full Docker installation. The project supports basic container operations like creating, starting, stopping, and removing containers, alongside networking features, making it useful for developers looking for a straightforward container management tool. The documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and contributions guidelines for users interested in extending the project's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did something (slightly) similar via proot, called Bag [1], which I must have not described as a docker alternative: It has nothing to do with cgroups, and the cli deviates from that of docker's.The backstory: To bypass internet censorship and deep packet inspection, I had written a proxy chain solution masquerading itself as plain html traffic. I needed it constantly running everywhere I went, but I didn't want to port it to a native android app. I wanted to run it through termux and at the time termux had no jdk/jre. Proot could spawn a archlinux env and there indeed was a jdk available.The arch env within termux turned out to be generally more suitable for all tasks. Creating and destroying ephemeral envs with different setups and prooting into them to just run a single command is easily automated with a script; I named it bag.sh, a drastically smaller form of a shipping container.Funny bag.sh also has a roadmap/todo in there untouched for 5 years! It's written on mobile screen hence mostly formatted to 40 columns lines to fit on the display without scrolling.[1]: https://github.com/hkoosha/bag&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these. Been a fan of minimal bash stuff.
Here's a proof of concept for a intra-cluster load balancer in 40 lines of bash done during a hackathon I organized to promote distributed infra with Docker, Mesos, etc. about a decade ago https://github.com/cell-os/metal-cell/blob/master/discovery/...I likely lost it, but I had a redundand and distributed reverse SSH tunnel based colo-to-cloud transfer tool.Shell Fu and others have good collections of these https://www.shell-fu.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like when repos say "not implemented yet" or "to-do" or "working on" and the last commit was years ago. Makes me feel better about not going back to my to-dos I drop through my code. (Not meaning to throw shade on this author, just finding it comforting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224670</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;Denmark is taking significant steps to address the environmental impact of fertilizers, particularly in relation to forest ecosystems. The country is implementing regulations aimed at reducing nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from agricultural practices, which can adversely affect forest health. The initiative includes promoting better farming methods and reducing fertilizer use, which in turn is expected to protect biodiversity and enhance the resilience of forest landscapes against climate change. The government's goal is to create sustainable management practices that balance agricultural productivity with environmental preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.If you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents. They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.[1] https://www.regeringen.dk/media/13261/aftale-om-et-groent-da...[2] https://mgtp.dk/media/iinpdy3w/aftale_om_implementering_af_e...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a good chart to keep in mind about this discusion is this one: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From https://cphpost.dk/2024-11-22/news/round-up/we-are-in-crisis..."Danish Crown, one of Denmark’s largest Danish meat producer, is facing significant financial challenges as pig deliveries to its processing plants have dropped in the 2023/24 financial year."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42226185</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The page describes Starlink's Direct-to-Cell service, which aims to provide satellite connectivity for mobile devices, enhancing communication in areas lacking reliable cellular service. It highlights the benefits of the system, such as global coverage and high-speed internet capabilities, making it effective for businesses, particularly in remote locations. The service is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing cell networks, allowing users to send texts and access the internet without traditional cell towers, ultimately supporting various industries by improving connectivity and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vertical integration by Starlink of the cheapest launch capability in the world (by far) is the reason there are no competitors, and there will be no competitors. The pace of innovation at SpaceX is not THE reason - it’s an additional reason that no one has a snowballs chance in hell of ever catching Starlink.I’ve seen talk of competitor satellite networks or a possible competitor emerging. Folks it’s game set and match, the trophy has been handed over and the crowd has gone home.SpaceX and Starlink have the same owner, both are private companies, with SpaceX launching 80% of the global space payload last year and rising, and Starlink has a constellation two orders of magnitude bigger than any competitor. It’s over. And IMO it’s awesome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone from Starlink or SpaceX is reading these comments here’s what you want to do: Sell your own branded trail cam with solar charging and LTE from orbit. You can charge $25-$40 a month for unlimited pictures sent from the cam. This would open up hunters, nature enthusiasts, and researchers to be able to place their hardware anywhere in the field without worrying about connectivity. Here in SWVA we have deep hollows that can’t get LTE without dense tower coverage that we don’t have the population to justify, but you can grab a satellite connection.After writing this out I’m beginning to doubt the market would be big enough but I know at least 20 people with 2 or more LTE cams for deer season.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I could pay Starlink directly and have global satellite based LTE instead of having to go through a specific carrier and be limited by other carriers’ reciprocity to specific countries and bandsOne space based cell plan for the whole world&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230103</guid></item><item><title>5.

Hosting blobs is one of those things that will inevitably go through iterations as we understand the abuse vectors more and more, but for now it's really fun to see this kind of usage in action. The PDS is meant to be a database host in the same sense that a webserver is a website host.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was curious as to the security context this runs in:    curl -i 'https://porcini.us-east.host.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:j22nebhg6aek3kt2mex5ng7e&amp;cid=bafkreic5fmelmhqoqxfjz2siw5ey43ixwlzg5gvv2pkkz7o25ikepv4zeq'

Follow an account, a list, or a starter pack, and you could theoretically modify GZDoom or some other client to know how to search and view any WADs posted by those accounts.

&lt;p&gt;The "smollm" project on GitHub by Hugging Face focuses on providing a community-driven repository for lightweight language models. It aims to facilitate easy access and experimentation with small transformer-based models that are efficient yet effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The repository includes resources for training, evaluating, and utilizing these models, promoting their use in applications where computational resources are limited. Additionally, it encourages collaboration and contributions from developers and researchers in the AI field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228472"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might be worth updating the title to "SmolLM: state-of-the-art small language model trained on open datasets" (See the first table of https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm for benchmarks)It was fascinating digging into this to find their dataset weights defined in a declarative YAML file [2]. 70% is from FineWeb/Commoncrawl but filtered using a classifier trained on Llama-70b's rating from 0-5 of the educational content of the text [3]. This is something we know small models like Phi-3 have been doing for a while, but it's great to see a fully open reproduction of it that beats their benchmarks. Definitely supports the idea you can get even better reasoning at smaller model sizes by carefully filtering and curating your training data (and generating good synthetic data from/distilling bigger models).You can see the 450k Llama educational value scores here:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-ll...
It's interesting, I think the text with 3 scores is really good, but the 5 scores pick content that is not very reasoning or information-heavy but just mentions education or a worksheet. For SmolLM they just took the documents with scores &gt;= 3 so it doesn't matter a ton.2. https://github.com/huggingface/smollm/blob/9efce803bc7e37727...
3. https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it's great that this is open source, and I understand the pressure for smaller models that can be run in a wider range of contexts, I continue to be annoyed that authors keep posting comparisons to models which are slightly smaller.In this page, SmolLM2-1.7B does a bit better than Qwen2.5-1.5B which is ahead of Llama3.2-1B. At the next size level up, in other comparisons I've seen that e.g. Phi-3.5 (which is ~3.8B params) does a bit better than Llama 3.2 3B. Gemma 2 has a 9B size, llama 3.1 has an 8B size and I think when that came out Mistral had a 7B model -- so whenever a new "small" thing does "better" than its peers, we can't easily see whether it's because of any of the many small choices that the authors made were actually better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pythia is stupidly easy to use.Then hookup a simple test harness.
- this is like a grand total of 3 commands
- git pull, install, point and run a model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228472</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They used an autonomous underwater vehicle with upward-looking multibeam sonar (the main one seems to operate at 300-kHz) to map 140 km² as well as measuring ocean currents, temperature, and salinity at 20 to 80 m below the ice. Multibeam was new to me, Wikipedia says this "emits acoustic waves in a fan shape beneath its transceiver [using] beamforming to extract directional information from the returning soundwaves, producing a swathe of depth soundings from a single ping" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibeam_echosounder)The researchers say that limited observational data on how the sea erodes this ice leads to uncertainty in sea level predictions and this new data should help future studies lower those error margins. I want to say cool stuff (no pun intended) but it's also frightening in a way... at least we'll better know what's coming for those who come after usI don't see any mention of how close previous assumptions were to what this new information shows; probably this is not yet processed/applied enough to interpret it in that way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone is interested in the overarching project that produced this paper (I assume; authors are PIs on the project), check out TARSAN:https://thwaitesglacier.org/projects/tarsanOn the AUV front, as well as multibeam from the Hugin, seafloor imagery has been mapped with an AUV named Rán.I work alongside the team who build Autosub Long Range, who were there in 2022, taking physical/chemical/biological measurements (CTD, microstructure, turbulence):https://noc.ac.uk/news/boaty-mcboatface-returns-thwaites-gla...Underwater Gliders have also been deployed under or near the ice sheet to do similar:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096706451...The "AUV under ice" thing is a fascinating challenge to me.  You have to rely a lot on different and novel navigation techniques (like terrain aided/bathymetric navigation and acoustic beacons).  And you have to work out how to get your very very expensive robot not stuck under an ice sheet, when its default failsafe is to become positively buoyant, and its primary method of communication (satellite comms)  requires a clear view of the sky :-)The results of the work are.... sobering?  Worrying?

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the concept of WTF-8, which is a character encoding that allows the proper representation and manipulation of text in UTF-8 without losing compatibility with ASCII. It emphasizes how WTF-8 can simplify handling text by allowing malformed UTF-8 sequences to be stored and processed without error, making it particularly useful for web development and data storage. The site provides explanations, examples, and practical applications to help developers understand and implement WTF-8 in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My rule of thumb is to treat strings as opaque blobs most of the time. The only validation I'd always enforce is some sane length limit, to prevent users from shoving entire novels inside. If you treat your strings as opaque blobs, and use UTF8, most of internationalization problems go away. Imho often times, input validation is an attempt to solve a problem from the wrong side. Say, when XSS or SQL injections are found on a site, I've seen people's first reaction to be validation of user input by looking for "special symbols", or add a whitelist of allowed characters, instead of simply escaping strings right before rendering HTML (and modern frameworks do it automatically), or using parameterized queries if it's SQL. If a user wants to call themselves "alert('hello')", why not? Why the arbitrary limits? I think there're very few exceptions to this, probably something law-related, or if you have to interact with some legacy service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A coworker once implemented a name validation regex that would reject his own name. It still mystifies me how much convincing it took to get him to make it less strict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an 'æ' in my middle name (formally secondary first name because history reasons). Usually I just don't use it, but it's always funny when a payment form instructs me to write my full name exactly as written on my credit card, and then goes on to tell me my name is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42226953</guid></item><item><title>10.

Then if you calculate 707 + 707, so lol + lol, you get 1414, which reads as "hihi", which is an alternative, more giggly version "haha". Actually it kind of works in English too now that I think about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat list but I’m confused: Why do many of the words on the left use what appears to be a zero character for the letter “O”. I understand why the zeroes are on the right, they just seem out of place on the left. Some of the words (e.g. GLOBS) use a regular letter O but some seem to use a zero (0) (e.g GL0SS)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone's curious, the longest word with unique letters (as well as the most distinct letters) is "obliges".If we forbid 0, we get "bilges" and "sleigh". Both of which strike me as great opportunities for an extremely obscure Easter egg in an adventure game ...Also, for completeness: 0O, 1I, 2Z, 3E, 4H, 5S, 6G, 7L, 8B.So you can `grep -ix '[iozehsglb]*' /usr/share/dict/words` yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182292</guid></item><item><title>11.

A lot of fascinating life stories we'll never know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article contains Young’s surviving eyewitness account of the much-memed ‘demon core’[0] incident involving Louis Slotin.Young expresses anger at the pressure put on Slotin to enact the experiment so dangerously in person.“ Hospitalized for observation, Young was released, but forever after blamed Slotin’s death on Groves’ insistence on obtaining test results before proper equipment was available. “There was no need to kill Louis Slotin to show that making critical mass measures should be made by remote control,” he wrote in 1975, still angry.”As the demon-core incident is often attributed to Slotin showing off and his careless youthful bravado, Young’s account is valuable as is testifies that pressure for results from the head of the project Gen. Leslie Groves was the cause that the experiment was not performed remotely.Young further testified that Slotin’s quick reactions saved him and others from a fatal dose.“ Slotin immediately knocked the two hemispheres of radioactive material apart with his hand, probably saving the other technicians and scientists in the room—including Young—from immediate death.
“So Slotin was not a fool but under deadline pressure for results and his actions saved others.Young is a fascinating chap, no formal science education but worked his way up to scientist and made the world’s first working breeder reactor in his spare time.[0] “ The meme-ification of the “Demon Core””https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200699&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213902</guid></item><item><title>12. 2007 Boston Mooninite Panic</title><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_Mooninite_panic</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The 2007 Boston Mooninite panic refers to a public alarm created by the discovery of LED displays featuring the character Mooninite from the animated show "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" placed around Boston as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for the movie. The light displays were mistaken for potential explosives, leading to an extensive and costly response from law enforcement and emergency services. The incident caused significant public disruption and resulted in arrests and charges against the marketing team responsible for the campaign. It underscored issues related to urban security and the public’s response to perceived threats in a post-9/11 context.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For what it's worth, I've worked at multiple places that ran shell scripts just fine for their deploys.- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.- One was in an industry that didn't need "Webscale" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.The place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.I don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is so easy that you only need two or three dedicated full-time employees to keep the mountains of YAML from collapsing in on themselves before cutting costs and outsourcing your cluster management to someone else.Sure, it can be easy, just pick one of the many cloud providers that fix all the complicated parts for you. Though, when you do that, expect to pay extra for the privilege, and maybe take a look at the much easier proprietary alternatives. In theory the entire thing is portable enough that you can just switch hosting providers, in practice you're never going to be able to do that without seriously rewriting part of your stack anyway.The worst part is that the mountains of YAML were never supposed to be written by humans anyway, they're readable configuration your tooling is supposed to generate for you. You still need your bash scripts and your complicated deployment strategies, but rather than using them directly you're supposed to compile them into YAML first.Kubernetes is nice and all but it's not worth the effort for the vast majority of websites and services. WordPress works just fine without automatic replication and end-to-end microservice TLS encryption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so unnuanced that it reads like rationalization to me. People seem to get stuck on mantras that simple things are inherently fragile which isn't really true, or at least not particularly more fragile than navigating a jungle of yaml files and k8s cottage industry products that link together in arcane ways and tend to be very hard to debug, or just to understand all the moving parts involved in the flow of a request and thus what can go wrong. I get the feeling that they mostly just don't like that it doesn't have professional aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42226005</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth guide on advanced configurations for WireGuard, a modern VPN solution known for its simplicity and performance. It discusses various topics, including the installation process, setting up multiple peers, configuring network settings, incorporating security practices, and troubleshooting common issues. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles of WireGuard to fully leverage its capabilities. The guide is aimed at users who are looking for more than just basic setup instructions, offering practical tips and insights for optimizing WireGuard’s performance in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really a game changer to be able to access all the local services and resources on the road without exposing them to the public internet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article implies that you have to use NAT with Wireguard which really isn't the case at all. Normal subnet routing works fine provided your destination hosts know to use the wireguard server as the gateway for the wireguard subnet. Just configuring a static route on the normal default router is generally enough. Certainly, there are cases where NAT is useful, for example I redirect attempts to use public DNS to my local DNS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229299</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fascinating.The idea of mark/scavenge is pretty cool for page-based allocation and deallocation.Also real-time or maybe latency-intolerant systems, which basically can't block for garbage collection.  You could probably keep scavenging and stay ahead of things without impacting things in a black and white way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Modern garbage collection assumes that the weak generational hypothesis holds and that most objects die youngAside, I'm curious how first-class support for value types and Go-style stack allocation via escape analysis changes the value proposition of the generational hypothesis. If we hypothesize that short-lived objects are local to a single function scope (and thus eligible for stack allocation either explicitly via a value type or heuristically via escape analysis) then it might completely upend the generational hypothesis and make it so that relatively more long-lived objects are getting heap-allocated. Surely someone's done some studies on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering if the .java TLD belonged to the Java island, or to Oracle or to someone else.https://icannwiki.org/.javaIt’s Oracle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229107</guid></item><item><title>17. 32k context length text embedding models</title><link>https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/09/18/voyage-3/</link><description>

For example, SQLite has sqlite-vss and PostgreSQL has pgvector.Do we still feel specialized vector databases are an overkill?We have AWS promoting amazon OpenSearch as the default vector database for a RAG knowledge base and that service is not cheap.Also I would like to understand a bit more about how to pre-process and chunk the data properly in a way that optimizes the vector embeddings, storage and retrieval ... any good guides on the same i cna refer to? Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the benefit of generating embeddings for such large chunks? Do people use these large contexts to include lots of document specific headers/footers or are they actually generating embeddings of single large documents?I don’t understand how the math works out on those vectors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found good results from summarizing my documents using a large context model then embedding those summaries using a standard embedding model (e.g. e5)This way I can tune what aspects of the doc I want to focus retrieval on, it's easier to determine when there are any data quality issues that need to be fixed, and the summaries have turned out to be useful for other use cases in the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225099</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how consumers can determine the source of their electricity, emphasizing the types of power plants that contribute to their local electric supply. It explains the various energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, and details the process of how power plants generate electricity. The piece discusses the importance of understanding one’s energy mix for making informed choices about energy usage and highlights resources available to track the origin of electricity. Additionally, it addresses the broader implications of energy consumption on environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It could be partially your neighbor's solar panels or batteries. A lot of domestic power that gets contributed to the grid never leaves the neighborhood. These things aren't always as clear cut.The key to lower prices on the grid is more flexible and localized pricing. Power suppliers don't like this because it favors cheaper sources of power that push their more expensive legacy generation out of the market. But it would create price incentives for demand and supply to align better.A good example is the UK, which has national energy pricing and a lot of excess wind power in Scottland that is often being curtailed at the same time gas plants further south need to power up to power local demand there. End result: the Scottish pay the same high rate even though they are literally discarding energy they don't know what to do with. If they had local energy pricing, their rates would go down a lot because they have a lot of wind power most of the time.And further south, people would either invest in local power generation (instead of far away in Scottland) or actually relocate data centers and other energy intensive businesses to where the power is cheap. As opposed to e.g. Slough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of discussion focuses on the supply side (not unexpected given the article).The demand side is where we can take individual / small group action. On the one hand, you have CA (and most of the US) phasing out incandescent light bulbs (great - lowers baseline demand) - but you also have an order of magnitude increase in compute (model training anyone?) as well as a push towards electrification of cars, household appliances, heating etc. All fine - but that energy has to be moved (unless you're generating locally with Solar Panels).Grid scale batteries and similar ancillary services do a pretty good job of levelling this out - making the market more "liquid" (to borrow a stock market term) - but they take 3-7y to bring up depending on the usual infra variables.&lt;shill&gt;
We think batteries to absorb household demand are part of the solution. [www.energyapplied.com]If you can control when these batteries act in unison (and, as with anything, the devil is in the details) - and deploy them densely enough to absorb forecasted demand spikes (another comment ITT mentioned LMP markets - astute) - then you complement grid scale storage with something you can roll out in weeks to cover a high stress area, not years
&lt;/shill&gt;Another comment mentioned "differently regulated" - and that's right - in order to participate in any of the supply and demand programs on the grid, you need to do a lot of things a certain way. The more you can encapsulate that for the user (don't have a household participate in Demand Response, do it through Nest or something similar and have 1mm households participate) - gets a lot more achievable.In a funny way, power markets are probably the US's last real free-trade market. My first few years deep in the back office of an investment bank, there were 31 NYSE floor traders, when I left 13 years later in 2020, there were 2, and most volume is program trading / etfs / electronic trading. Ditto fixed income (bonds and bond like instruments), foreign exchange (though these latter two are slower).Financial Markets inherently move towards being vanilla and scalable because it's cheaper - and this has been one area where the race to the bottom hasn't entirely harmed the consumer (there once was a time when you had to pay a broker a commission on each stock trade. Etrade / Robinhood anyone?).Power still has a long way to go before it's there - but it will _probably_ be a good thing when it does, and given that it touches hard infrastructure and nobody's forgetting Enron any time soon - it _probably_ will end up better off for the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There’s pretty much no way for them[renewables] to lose money if they’re connected to the grid, especially because many get outside incentives for every megawatt-hour they generate. They even submit negative bids in some cases, meaning they’re willing to pay money to stay connected to the grid.The negative price reflects their incentive, not their willingness to pay.If I am guaranteed $18 a MW/h for my solar farm, then I will bid -$18 (or maybe slightly less to account for costs).  The state, or federal government will ensure I am paid at least $18.Without these incentives we would not see negative prices, zero perhaps, but not negative.For instance the IRA offers upto $33.00/MWh incentives.[1]This is a problem if you have a power plant that must run - such as a nuke.  You may end up paying that negative price, unless the market offers you some sort of make whole payment.  But where does that come from?[1]https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/inflation-reduction-act-ta...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183747</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NASA's ongoing research into the mystery of life's handedness, specifically the preference for left-handed amino acids over right-handed ones in biological processes. It highlights the significance of this phenomenon in understanding the origins of life on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe. The piece explains recent findings that suggest that chemical processes in space may have influenced the predominance of left-handed amino acids, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms. The exploration aims to unravel the complexities of astrobiology and the conditions that contribute to the formation of life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only tangentially related, but because they are so amazing here are a few videos that illustrate the process of transcription (creating mRNA from DNA) and translation (creating a protein from mRNA).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMtWvDbfHLohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfYf_rPWUdYThe common complaint with these videos is that everything is more complex.  One thing that isn't evident is that these specific videos (built mostly by Drew Barry) actually model a lot of other molecules to create a more realistic physical environment with brownian motion and whatnot.  Then the irrelevant molecules are simply made transparent in the rendering.Obviously it's still much much more complex (eg the constant stream of ATP used to drive many of these operations is not illustrated).There are these and many more great illustrations/explanations at WEHImovies on youtubehttps://www.youtube.com/@WEHImovies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While all right-handed amino acids would presumably be fine, do we have any idea whether mixed chirality would work? I suspect no, since they presumably have different folding behavior but might be tricky to distinguish chemically during the protein synthesis process, making e.g. different codons for left and right-handed amino acids infeasible to implement. I'd love to hear from a biologist whether any of that is correct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures.”Homochirality resulting from chemical determinism would be the more surprising result to me.The straightforward explanation is that random perturbations early in the evolution of life broke symmetry and led to homochirality of all descendent life, similar to how random perturbations early in the life of the universe broke symmetry and led to our world being made of particles instead of antiparticles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214143</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some niceties here, but I think this is a little thin on the security aspects of the scheme: it's not clear how users establish the authenticity of transitively received petnames, for example.More fundamentally, there's a factor outside of Zooko's triangle: trust isn't really transitive[1]. I trust my doctor and my doctor trusts their sibling, but I don't necessarily trust their sibling.With that being said, I think there's a pretty rich research space here, and I think the edge/local aspects of this design are pretty interesting! I just hope we don't end up with a reinvention of historically insufficient web-of-trust architectures :-)[1]: https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/4349/904849.p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a typo here that affects the meaning:&gt; Even though Ben is trusting that caller ID is correct, he can't imagine any reason why someone would be trying to phish him to authorize a topping change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact lists do work and are okay for friends, but businesses also need to publish contact information. What do you put on a sign, on a business card, or in an advertisement? You'd need to print the underlying id number, which makes it part of the UI.Inevitably, people are going to want something like a 1-800 number, perhaps with a mapping to letters that are easy to remember. Either you can pick the number you want, or people are going to end up re-rolling until they get a "nice" number, and then there's competition for nice numbers just like in other namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228146</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports on the passing of NC State's mascot, a live mascot dog named "Marco", who served as the university's marshall. Marco was loved by the community for his spirited presence at events and functions, where he represented the university. The article highlights the impact Marco had during his life at NC State and includes comments from university officials and fans who cherished their interactions with the beloved mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to use this time to drop the Marshall Brain work that had the biggest impact on me, and is some of the most prescient speculative fiction I've read.Manna: Two Views of Humanity’s FutureHe contracts two societies.  One is a dystopia where AI very, very similar to today's ML models is integrated into society as a replacement for the middle class, removing social mobility as well as acting as a panopticon lower management, and centralized social credit system.The other society uses the similar technology not as a social class moat, but as a tool to form a synthesis with all members of their culture and and unlock new levels of individual freedom.https://marshallbrain.com/manna1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut punch for me.  He was influential in many ways, as multiple comments here have already attested-- in particular the 'Manna' story that has been mentioned several times, which definitely knocked my socks off.Since no one else has brought it up yet, I want to say that one of his websites, "Why Won't God Heal Amputees" (https://whywontgodhealamputees.com/) was very important in my world.  It may not exactly be the most highbrow philosophical or theological treatise you've ever encountered, but it crystallized several points I still consider hugely significant.For anyone raised by Christian fundamentalists of the type who continue to claim to believe in miracles being possible as a direct result of prayer, it is one of the most important things you may ever read.  It lays bare the blatant falsehoods at the root of all such claims, forcing you to grapple with the fact that whatever higher power(s) may exist, they do not keep their supposed written promises in any way that we human beings would consider honest amongst each other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, when I was a kid back in the early 2000s, howstuffworks was my favorite website. I bet I read every article on how various things work (there were many hundreds).I found that the knowledge from that website helped me understand how everything in the world worked and satisfied my curious mind. I attribute my knack for understanding new things and fixing things to this website.Back then, the site was clean and had very good clean and expertly written explanations of how various mechanical, everyday and scientific equipment worked. Nowadays that website is not the same, seems riddled with SEO spam and fluff articles like a content mill.Rest in Peace Marshall Brain, thank you for all your contributions to my (and likely others) life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228759</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given that anyone who’s interacted with the LLM field for fifteen minutes should know that “jailbreaks” or “prompt injections” or just “random results” are unavoidable, whichever reckless person decided to hook up LLMs to e.g. flamethrowers or cars should be held accountable for any injuries or damage, just as they would for hooking them up to an RNG. Riding the hype wave of LLMs doesn’t excuse being an idiot when deciding how to control heavy machinery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone working on implementing the three laws of robotics? (Or have we come up with a better model?)Edit: Being completely serious here. My reasoning was that if the robot had a comprehensive model of the world and of how harm can come to humans, and was designed to avoid that, then jailbreaks that cause dangerous behavior could be rejected at that level. (i.e. human safety would take priority over obeying instructions... which is literally the Three Laws.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For instance, one YouTuber showed that he could get the Thermonator robot dog from Throwflame, which is built on a Go2 platform and is equipped with a flamethrower, to shoot flames at him with a voice command.What does this device exist for?  And why does it need a LLM to function?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225971</guid></item><item><title>23. 1 Dataset. 100 Visualizations</title><link>https://100.datavizproject.com/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the performance potential of AMD's Infinity Fabric and explores how it can be optimized beyond its standard configurations. It outlines the technical aspects of Infinity Fabric, including its architecture and how it interconnects various components in AMD processors. The piece highlights experiments and benchmarks that showcase the scalability and efficiency of Infinity Fabric when pushed to its limits, ultimately suggesting that there is significant headroom for performance improvements in AMD's future designs.&lt;/p&gt;

The balance between bandwidth, latency, and clock speeds shows both clever engineering and limits under pressure. 
Makes me wonder how these trade-offs will evolve in future designs. Thoughts?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;George’s detailed analysis always impresses me. I’m amazed with his attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper thread placement and numa handling does have a massive impact on modern amd cpus - significantly more so than on Xeon systems.
This might be anecdotal, but I’ve seen performance improve by 50% on some real world workloads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230355</guid></item><item><title>25.

For adhoc extraction I then poke at the har with jq to get what I need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to know if there is a way to have FF developer tools automatically update CSS like Chrome does if you add a directory to its sources tab.

&lt;p&gt;The page discusses advanced examples of recursive queries in SQLite, showcasing their capabilities through various scenarios. It explains how recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) function, using practical illustrations such as calculating factorials, generating sequences, and handling hierarchical data structures. Additionally, the examples aim to demonstrate the versatility of recursive queries and how they can simplify complex data retrieval tasks within SQLite databases.&lt;/p&gt;

I would love to take a 2 hour class on “thinking in SQL for hackers” or something, but I haven’t really found anything to improve my mental model from “broken” to “working” so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this might be a relatively new example - I remember having seen the fractal one but I didn't recall the Sudoku one.Turns out both of those examples have been in that documentation for over a decade now! https://web.archive.org/web/20140331191105/http://sqlite.org...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mandelbrot example had been around in various forms for quite some time, IIRC I first saw it in ~2006 for SQL Server which gained recursive CTE support in its 2005 release. Another example from around that time was using recursive CTEs to define dragon curves using spatial types that would then be drawn using SSMS's support for displaying data in those types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230384</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's interesting is that these devices don't need 321+ litho steps; the vertical layers are all defined with deposition. Lithography step count isn't layer dependent it seems.https://youtu.be/ANHzVOiUwGIhttps://thememoryguy.com/3d-nands-impact-on-the-equipment-ma...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in school studying NAND devices (2004-2010) we were quite apprehensive at the long term quantum stability of 4-layer devices.This (the past 20 years of improvement) is an incredible feat of engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does 'layer' mean in this context? I'm only familiar with planar style logic process nodes which have maybe up to 20 layers (and way more lithography steps to manufacture those layers), but I am completely ignorant of how the term is used for a flash process node.How many layers are needed for each physical cell? 
Is it 1,2, or a lot more? Is this effectively 321 physical TLC cells stacked vertically and some planar style logic at the bottom of the stack.Also, where do multiple pieces of silicon factor into this - I assume we might be up to 16 silicon dies deep with through-silicon-vias, which would mean a cross section of a package could actually have 5000 layers - that sounds crazy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229825</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This approach to careers fails to take into account that we inherently change as people.In periods of ones life other things matters - maybe it is taking an education, starting a family, etc.Other periods work matter.It should be entirely fine to switch it on and off and change tracks throughout life - and in my view it seems like it is!To reach a peak it takes roughly 10 years, but these 10 years can be started at 40 when your kids does not wear diapers anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I am a pessimist but I really don't believe you can plan for 20y in the future especially in the tech sector. People fail to realize that we live in a world that changes not in a linear fashion but rather exponential. For all we know in 10y we will only need 1/5 of the coders we have and IC won't be viable, who knows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228538</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new framework for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, addressing the challenges of traditional methods that often assume users have static preferences. It introduces a model that captures dynamic user behavior and preferences over time, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the prediction accuracy of recommendations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, showcasing improvements in user satisfaction and system performance compared to existing models. This work contributes to the field by providing a more nuanced understanding of user interactions in dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a Supreme Court case involving Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, which faces a lawsuit over alleged misuse of user data. The case centers on the interpretation of the Communications Decency Act and whether social media companies can be held liable for content posted by third parties. The Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for how platforms regulate content and handle user privacy. The outcome may affect not only Meta but also the broader tech industry in terms of accountability for user-generated content and data protection practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I finally got around to trying this out right now. Here's how to run it using uvx (so you don't need to install anything first):    uvx --from open-interpreter interpreter

I took the simplest route and pasted in an OpenAI API key, then I typed:    find largest files on my desktop

It generated a couple of chunks of Python, asked my permission to run them, ran them and gave me a good answer.Here's the transcript: https://gist.github.com/simonw/f78a2ebd2e06b821192ec91963995...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny that we're getting so much attention funneled towards the thought-to-machine I/O problem now that LLMs are on the scene.If the improvements are beneficial now, then surely they were beneficial before.Prior to LLMs, though, we could have been making judicious use of simple algorithmic approaches to process natural language constructs as command language.  We didn't see a lot of interest in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the "Can you ..." phrasing used in this demo/project fascinating.  I would have expected the LLM to basically say "Yes I can, would you like me to do it?" to most of these questions, rather than directly and immediately executing the action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171379</guid></item><item><title>34.

  "echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

Until eventually  Future hung task reports are suppressed, see sysctl kernel.hung_task_warnings

So I'm looking forward to getting an actual count of how often this happens without needing to babysit the warning suppressions and count the incidents myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What counts as a hung task? Blocking on unsatisfiable I/O for more than X seconds? Scheduler hasn’t gotten to it in X seconds?If a server process is blocking on accept(), wouldn’t it count as hung until a remote client connects? or do only certain operations count?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228672</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like that they are very blunt and to the point.It'd be really cool if we can add more social dynamic features to papers / research, and have people correct papers in the open, like twitter community notes, to the point that if you can really disprove it, the paper is now marked "wrong" or something like that on arxiv. Sort of inbetween collaborative science or hunting for patent prior art or bug bounty hunting. Getting paid for it would be even better, making money by sniping issues in research. One can dream.I wonder how much money in bounties it'd take to proof-invalidate whole branches of psychology (insert your own pet peeve here) research in a methodical way, probably not that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The corrections are wonderful. Concise and to the point.The author is a powerhouse in his field, known by researchers and casual readers. He has nothing to fear from publishing corrections. Nobody is trying to step on him, keep him from promotion, or argue that his research is meaningless.Other researchers have less privilege, and (imo) therefore will be less forthcoming.If you only have two papers, admitting one has a fatal flaw instead of giving more talks about it will be career suicide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without knowing the specific context: I think this really is a good example of how errors should be disclosed.
We need to acknowledge that scientists/academics are human; even very competent mathematicians make mistakes and some of these mistakes appear in published papers. What we lack in many fields is a culture and process that allows (and ideally, encourages) one to disclose: "this was wrong, here is how I fixed it, or how it's actually correct". E.g., in the communities I know in Computer Science &amp; AI, I rarely even see errata lists on personal webpages, not to speak of journals that provide a straightforward process for updates. I would even go so far to claim that the current culture, in which honest errors cannot be straightforwardly corrected, plays into the hands of the clearly dishonest "bad apples".Science is, obviously, not a "monotonic" process in which every single paper adds to the truth; this is practically not even the case for mathematics, which is at least monotonic on object-level (but mistakes happen all the time). As a prominent example, consider this impressive list of Feynman errata: https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/flp_errata.html.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228866</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Demikernel," a novel operating system architecture that aims to enhance performance and modularity by separating the core kernel functionality from the various services that depend on it. It emphasizes how Demikernel allows for more flexible and efficient resource management by enabling user-level services to run in a more isolated manner, thus improving fault tolerance and security. The author explores the implications of this architecture for system design and its potential impact on application development, highlighting the benefits of lower latency and improved system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some great ideas for improving the kernel interface while still allowing efficient DPDK-style pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s really frustrating that the HotOS paper itself has no details about the benchmarking, and the blog post just says “redis benchmark”. What was the system setup? Persistence options? What was ported to demikernel? The client writing, the server reading from the NIC? Based on the problem specified in the paper, I assume its reading from the NIC that was implemented in DemiOS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a super cool idea, and it’s something that sounds fun to play with/try out.Therefore, I eagerly await the inevitable influx of:- “you don’t need it”- “you’re not FAANG enough to justify it”,-“seems overly complicated my Python-on-Ubuntu-is-good-enough and who needs more”Style comments telling us why we shouldn’t have fun things like this.Anyone got anymore comments to add to the bingo-card?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214113</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of transitioning from traditional network states, which are often characterized by centralized authority and control, to network societies that emphasize decentralization, collaboration, and community-oriented governance. It argues that network societies harness the power of technology and social connections to promote innovation, inclusivity, and resilience, enabling individuals and groups to thrive without relying on hierarchical structures. The author advocates for fostering these societies to empower local communities and encourage participatory decision-making that reflects diverse voices.&lt;/p&gt;

I was there in 2019, at one point I was at an airport, and a screen was bragging, "Stand where the camera can see your face, and we'll tell you which way to your gate.". It worked too, the screen displayed my name, flight number and direction to my gate. And implicitly, "We can identify you wherever you are.".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For this to work they must have already done facial recognition on everyone’s ID photos, so I fail to see what opting out even does for me from a privacy perspective. Seems like shutting the barn door after the horse is already out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet again we accept the premise that we need 'more' security so it is OK to do these types of things. This implies without evidence that there is a problem and then jumps right to the, again, unfounded conclusion that this type of thing will solve that hypothetical issue. The discussion shouldn't be about how to do this 'responsibly', implicitly admitting that there is some sort of need, and instead it should be about how to dismantle things like this completely and how to stop new things like this from ever happening again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228795</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author is on the right track here. News orgs have responded to declining revenue by making way more of the exact same material fewer and fewer people are willing to pay for. They see AI as a way to cut costs on what they already make, but the problem is that the medium itself is in a death spiral. Making the medium cheaper doesn't change the industry's long term prospects.It's clear that folks have found new formats for their sources of truth. Whether those new sources of truth are better or worse is irrelevant. You have to meet people where they are. And guess what? They aren't on unusably ad-laden news sites with inscrutable layouts and useless search tools. They're on TikTok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps they could work hard at reporting the news and not reporting their opinion.  Perhaps, instead of having a 24 hr news cycle, they could produce less, but higher quality content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journalism needs to pursue facts and produce new information as events take place or new developments emerge. Also, a lot of investigative journalism takes work and fearless collection of sources and other dangerous activities.For me, news is the "new" things, not some LLM generated regurgiation of old facts. I am really saddened for last few years since the emergence of genAI, because everyone(who do not understand more than hype info) somehow assumes that, genAI can start writing latest news and articles of events or somehow predict(Minority Report is not real!) future events.But, these LLMs know only as much _as they are trained on_, and by the time they are being trained on latest news, those are no longer news at all.I see how News can be immune to genAI because of the "new" factor of it, but the greed of automation of money-printing is too much and reality is still not sinking in.As an alternative, news reporters can have somekind of twitter(X) like channel somewhere, where they can post latest events, bits of investigation and an omnichannel genAI can scrape these live and start combining and summarizing the events into more cohorent report, which could give the news management the greed of plugging genAI and printing money, while reduce the workload of journalists of sitting in and writing up that whole report ... I honestly don't know, why journalism even needs genAI, just because everyone is using it to generate slop does not mean I must jump in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224212</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the historical and cultural significance of slouching and back pain, examining how societal attitudes toward posture have evolved over the years. It discusses how slouching has often been associated with negative traits such as laziness or lack of discipline, while also considering the impact of modern lifestyles, including the prevalence of sitting and technology use, on physical health. The piece highlights the need to reconsider our understanding of posture, advocating for a more nuanced perspective that considers individual comfort and the body's natural tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems entirely possible that "good posture" is an idea that comes from our monkey heritage where standing tall was a way to threaten other monkeys and gain status.  Also standing up straight may be inherently unnatural, monkeys don't usually do it, and it might actually be the cause of lower back pain for all anyone knows.  In other words, a posture fad may be the primary cause of lower back pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211561</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The project titled "LLa" on GitHub is an open-source framework designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly focused on developing and fine-tuning language models. It provides tools and resources for researchers and developers to create, train, and evaluate language models efficiently. The repository includes documentation, example scripts, and guidelines for usage, making it accessible for users looking to leverage the framework for their NLP applications.&lt;/p&gt;

They are somehow active in contrast to things like exa which is not maintained anymore.eza: (https://github.com/eza-community/eza)lsd: (https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)colorls: (https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)g: (https://github.com/Equationzhao/g)ls++: (https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS)logo-ls: (https://github.com/canta2899/logo-ls) - this is forked because main development stopped 4 years ago.Any more?Personally I prefer eza and wrote a zsh plugin that is basically aliases that matches what I have from my muscle memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for all the feedback! Let me clarify a few things about lla.
The most amazing part of this project wasn't just building another ls alternative - it was the incredible learning journey. Building a systems tool in Rust while implementing a plugin architecture taught me more in a few weeks than months of reading could have.
Yes, it does more than traditional ls, and that's intentional. The plugin system came from scratching my own itch of constantly switching between different terminal tools. Each feature added was a chance to dive deeper into systems programming and Unix internals.
The performance still needs work, and the documentation could be better. But that's the beauty of open source - you ship it, learn from the feedback, and keep improving. Building in public is an incredible way to level up your skills.
For anyone considering a similar project: pick a common tool you use daily and try reimagining it. You'll be surprised how much you learn along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did anyone here use Genera on an original lisp machine? It had a pseudo-graphical interface and a directory listing provided clickable results. It would be really neat if we could use escaping to confer more information to the terminal about what a particular piece of text means.Feature-request: bring back clickable ls results!Bonus points for defining a new term type and standard for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229003</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the two types of assertions in Rust—debug assertions and release assertions—and their significance in improving code quality. It explains that debug assertions are used during development to catch errors early, while release assertions are optimized for performance in production environments. The author emphasizes the importance of incorporating both types to ensure robust error handling and maintain efficiency in Rust applications. Through practical examples and explanations, the article aims to enhance developers' understanding of using assertions effectively to write better code in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219627"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &gt; These days I thus view asserts as falling into two categories:
    &gt;    1. Checking problem domain assumptions.
    &gt;    2. Checking internal assumptions.

(1) is the category of assert that should not be an assert. That is an error to be handled, not asserted.Ok, to be fair, (1) is really a combination of two categories: (1a) assumptions about uncontrolled external input, and (1b) assumptions about supposedly controlled or known input. Both should be handled with error checking most of the time, but it's forgivable for (1b) to be asserted if it's too inconvenient to do proper error handling. (1b) and (2) are problems that you need to fix, and the sooner and clearer the issue is announced, the more likely and easier it is to be fixed.One thing I didn't see mentioned is that asserts, especially category (2), enable fuzz testing to be vastly more effective. A fuzz test doesn't have to stumble across something that causes a crash or a recognizably bad output; it just needs to trigger an assert. Which is another reason to not use asserts for unexpected input; fuzzers are supposed to give unexpected input, and your program is supposed to handle it reasonably gracefully. If you over-constrain the input, then first you'll be wrong because weirdness will sneak in anyway, and second the fuzzer is harder to implement correctly and is less powerful. The fuzzer is supposed to be a chaos monkey, and it works best if you allow it to be one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth pointing out that Python's asserts can also be "compiled" away if you use the -O flag (or PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1), which eliminates their runtime cost.It's also worth pointing out that this is the reason you should *never* put side-effects or security-relevant checks in assert statements. For example, you should never do something like this:  assert f.read(4) == b"\x89PNG", "Not a PNG file"
  # proceed to read and parse the rest of the file

but rather, you should do  magic = f.read(4)
  assert magic == b"\x89PNG", "Not a PNG file"

so that your code doesn't suddenly break when someone decides to be clever and use -O.Also, fun unrelated fact: Python does have something like a preprocessor, although it's rarely used. If you condition on the flag __debug__:  if __debug__:
    expensive_runtime_check()

and then run Python with -O, the if statement and its body will be entirely deleted from the bytecode - even the `if` check will be deleted. It can be used for including "debug" code in hot code, where the extra flag check itself might be expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The problem that I’ve just expressed ultimately occurs because languages like C force us to encode both kinds of assumption with a single assert statement: either all asserts are compiled in or none are.It’s trivial to write a debug_assert macro in C, so no, you’re not forced to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219627</guid></item><item><title>47.

The progress on the already agreed targets has been lacking.It's like having a meeting about a project whose deadline was 3 weeks ago and having your team tell you that the new deadline 2 days from now will for sure be met this time.Countries keep agreeing to new targets that are even more ambitious than the previous unmet targets. It's not as if just publishing the new targets will make the old targets much more achievable.Make it make sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This whole charade is so ill conceived. Honestly, the top 20 developed nations are literally THE problem. It's a demand side problem not a supply side one. We need to stop buying container loads of virtually disposable electronics from China every week, stop driving to the shops, stop running energy intensive appliances, you get the drift.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 years ago, I worked for a small ISP (back when there was such a thing.) When I started there, we had one upstream ISP. I was charged with getting us multihomed. I found some tutorials written by Avi Freedman (1). I don't know what I would have done without him. He made an intimidating topic approachable. Thanks to him, I got us a /20 from ARIN and advertised our routes to two different peers. It was fascinating to learn how it all worked. And the more I learned about it, the more amazed I was that it worked at all.(1) http://avi.freedman.net/Avi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article.That flapping from EpicUp 140.99.244.0/23 prefix should have been subject to route dampening. This is per peer or per prefix rate limiting typically enforced on all peers by ISPs to prevent this exact issue of a single prefix making up a significant portion of the global BGP churn.I’m unconvinced of the correlation between the updates that the author attributed to knock on effects. It would be pretty janky to have your advertisements be based on the path to other autonomous systems’ prefixes, especially unstable ones.I don’t think there is a 40 minute periodicity either (at least there wasn’t 8 years ago when I was deep in the BGP world). Smells like what this dataset happened to show either by luck or because of the network the author was getting the BGP feed from.If you dig into the data and look at which AS’s and prefixes are experiencing changes, you’ll find it’s all over the place and there isn’t really any bigger pattern.On any given day there are usually a few noisy ISPs because of bad circuits or misconfigurations. Then there are new prefixes flapping in and out as a new thing is brought online for the first time, etc. Then sprinkle in path changes for regular draining maintenance, etc.It’s simultaneously both fascinating and a little horrifying how a little ISP in Kansas experiencing a fiber consuming backhoe shows up on routers in Perth. Yet the frequency of updates is kept to &lt;10hz globally through tons of hand tuned policies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to learn about BGP (especially day-to-day stuff for peering scenarios), the Network Startup Resource Center out of U.Oregon has a good series of videos going through things:* https://learn.nsrc.org/bgp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:02:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233565</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I compile a lot of C++ code from a lot of places, and the only time I run into code that somehow simply doesn't work on newer versions of C++ and where the developers aren't even sure if they will accept any patches to fix the issue as they claim it "isn't supported" to use a newer version of C++--even for the public headers of a library--is, you guessed it: code from Google.Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call "modern", and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.So... I really am not sure I buy the entire premise of this article? Honestly, I am extremely glad that Google is finally leaving the ecosystem, as I generally do not enjoy it when Google engineers try to force their ridiculous use cases down peoples' throats, as they seem to believe they simply know better than everyone else how to develop software.Like... I honestly feel bad for the Rust people, as I do not think the increasing attention they are going to get from Google is going to be at all positive for that ecosystem, any more than I think the massive pressure Google has exerted on the web has been positive or any more than the pressure Google even exerted on Python was positive (not that Python caved to much of it, but the pressure was on and the fact that Python refused to play ball with Google was in no small part what caused Go to exist at all).(FWIW, I do miss Microsoft's being in the space, but they honestly left years ago -- Herb's existence until recent being kind of a token consideration -- as they have been trying to figure out a tactical exit to C++ ever since Visual J++ and, arguably, Visual Basic, having largely managed to pivot to C# and TypeScript for SDKs long ago. That said... Sun kicking Microsoft out of Java might have been really smart, despite the ramifications?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the people who work on C++ standards: I approve of the current C++ trajectory and please ignore all of the online noise about "the future of C++." To anyone that disagrees severely with the C++ trajectory as stated, please just consider another language, e.g. Rust. I don't want static lifetime checking in C++ and if you want static lifetime checking, please use Rust. I am not a government contractor, if you are a government contractor who must meet bureaucratic risk-averse government requirements, please use Rust. I have an existing development process that works for me and my customers, I have no significant demand for lifetime checking. If your development process is shiny and new and necessitates lifetime checking, then please use Rust. To Rust advocates, you can have the US government and big tech. You can even have Linux. Just leave my existing C++ process alone. It works and the trade offs we have chosen efficiently accomplish our goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ is not just C++ but also the C preprocessor, the STL, the linker, the C libraries and SDKs you can't help but depend on, the build system, the build scripts, the package manager, the IDEs and IDE add-ons, the various quirks on various platforms, etc.  That's on top of knowing the code base of your application.Being really good at C++ almost demands that you surrender entire lobes of your brain to mastering the language.  It is too demanding and too dehumanizing.  Developers need a language and a complete tool chain that is designed as a cohesive whole, with as little implicit behavior, special cases and clever tricks as possible.  Simple and straight-forward.  Performance tweaks, memory optimizations and anything else that is not straightforward should be done exclusively by the compiler.  I.E. we should be leveraging computers to do what they do best, freeing our attention so we can focus on the next nifty feature we're adding.Zig is trying to do much of this, and it is a huge undertaking.  I think an even bigger undertaking than what Zig is attempting is needed.  The new "language" would also include a sophisticated IDE/compiler/static-analyzer/AI-advisor/Unit-Test-Generator that could detect and block the vast majority of memory safety errors, data races and other difficult bugs, and reveal such issues as the code is being written.  The tool chain would be sophisticated enough to handle the cognitive load rather than force the developer to bear that burden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231489</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Do Not Stab" discusses the importance of safety and awareness in various contexts, emphasizing the risks associated with harmful actions and the consequences they entail. It encourages readers to consider the implications of their decisions and to prioritize non-violent resolutions to conflicts. The piece serves as a cautionary reminder to promote positive interactions rather than resorting to aggression or harm.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s great satire, but it really does mirror a larger societal shift where the burden of safeguarding personal autonomy has shifted from institutions/regulators to individual users. Do-Not-Stab, Do-Not-Track, whatever it might be, any sort of “voluntary compliance” is a non-starter in the face of financial pressuresIMO we need to start normalizing being militant about this stuff again, to aggressively and adversarially defend the freedom to use your computer the way you choose to use it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such transparent EU Bureaucracy shilling. No wonder Europe doesn't have any large SaaS companies with their stabbing unfriendly business climate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232040</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Anthropic's introduction of the Model Context Protocol, a framework designed to improve the interaction between AI models and users by establishing clear guidelines for how models can utilize context for better performance. It emphasizes enhancing AI safety, interpretability, and user experience by allowing users to specify context through structured protocols. The protocol aims to mitigate misunderstandings and incorrect responses from AI systems, thereby fostering more reliable and effective communication between humans and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The world's thinnest spaghetti, about 200 times thinner than a human hair, has been created by a UCL-led research team. The spaghetti is not intended to be a new food but was created because of the wide-ranging uses that extremely thin strands of material, called nanofibers, have in medicine and industry.This is a fantastic first paragraph, which unfortunately is not the norm. It succinctly explains what was created (world's thinnest spaghetti), the scale at which it is impressive (200 times thinner than a human hair), who did it (a UCL-led research team), and why it matters (the second sentence) while simultaneously explaining what it is not for that most people would think about.It’s impossible to provide every minute detail in one short paragraph, but that one is dense with information, clear, and gives you an immediate sense if the article is of interest to you.Kudos to the University College London. Though I’d like to be more specific and know exactly who wrote/edited that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The researchers also had to carefully warm up the mixture for several hours before slowly cooling it back down to make sure it was the right consistency.Always got to let the nano-gluten relax.I hope they used phosphor bronze extruding electrostatic fields. The sauce needs the rough edges to coat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mentioned in the article, the second thinnest spaghetti https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20161014-the-secret-behin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:03:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212980</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the retro video game console, the Super Cassette Vision, highlighting its unique place in gaming history and its features. It celebrates the nostalgia associated with early gaming systems, detailing the games available for the platform and its impact on the industry. The piece also touches on the cultural significance of the console in Japan during the 1980s, positioning it as a fascinating piece of technology that contributed to the evolution of video gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a somewhat active Super Cassette Vision homebrew scene in Japan that's been able to achieve pretty impressive results with the machine's unorthodox graphics hardware. The best looking ones are probably the ports of ChoRenSha68k ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wDLOa_4H4 ) and Space Harrier ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9iHAbbzIQ ), and they've also done ports of Super Mario Bros. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MudYEDUK3Nw ) and Dragon Quest ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iisV8xHCB-w ). Of course, the NES ports kind of expose the weakness of being forced to use sprites for scrolling backgrounds, as there's not enough to fill the screen if you want a color background. As a result, Super Mario Bros. only has 1 color backgrounds and Dragon Quest isn't fullscreen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in the whole game catalog available from the Super Cassette Vision, the RndStranger youtube channel plays a bit of every game on the system in chronological release order: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1sb8k4ZPagbvyrcU13KR...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should mention that you mean the japan console market, not US.In 1983 the US console market collapsed because of the many low-quality atari games and not-licenced consoles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983The NES was released in US test markets as the redesigned NES in October 1985.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232782</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fantastic stuff, building these machines out of odd primitives.They kind of remind me of blind SQL injection attacks. When you can inject SQL, but can't view the output, so you use things like `pg_sleep()` to get a low-fidelity form of query output. Depending on how far you want to go, you can use different sleep lengths to slowly exfiltrate data.https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this for some work I did a few months ago. It's a very interesting idea to try to uncover a computer within a computer. It reminds me of the Atari 2600 emulators in Minecraft [1], or things like using bitwise operators to compute and write arbitrary data to memory as is done in the Pegasus/NSO exploit [2]. But I think the literature does not necessarily imply that these "weird machines" are Turing complete or capable of much; they are more general. From my understanding weird machines are some sort of FSM of unintended/weird states in a program with various transitions to go from weird state to weird state. The use is to be able to construct a weird machine with enough states and transitions to get a program to a vulnerable state where it can be exploited. Getting something like this with micro-architectural weird machines, the Pegasus exploit, etc. is of course much harder, and more valuable. It will also be interesting to see if the theory behind weird machines becomes used for automated exploit generation in the future.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7T5_xH24M[2] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This doesn't seem to be useful for hiding the fact that something suspicious is going on. If I understand it correctly, a static analysis of the program would reveal that they are decrypting code with an AES key derived from CPU instruction timings, and then executing that code inside a TSX transaction.Hardly normal behavior for non-malicious code. The only thing hidden is the actual key that will be used when it runs correctly, and hence what exactly the decrypted code does.(Also, didn't Intel obsolete TSX already in more recent CPU generations, because of its use for speculative execution side-channels?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235418</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that I am always looking for in a new "reusable", "composable" SQL tool is reuse of the same analytical queries across different source tables.My litmus test:I have a table "people" with the columns "people.firstname", "people.lastname", and a table "persons" with the columns "persons.firstname", "persons.lastname". I now want to create a query that gives me the "fullname" (".firstname" + " " + ".lastname") of all rows of both tables. If I have to spell out the logic for how to calculate the fullname in the query twice, the test is failed.(Taking the shortcut of creating the union of both tables first is not allowed, but I can't think of a simple example that enforces that restriction).For some reason, all of the solutions (PRQL, Malloy, dbt) that try to make SQL more reusable don't really consider this kind of reuse, and with that ultimately fall flat for the use-cases I would typically have for them. Sadly, Trilogy doesn't seem to be any better on that front.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be off here, but this seems like the right place to ask: don't most SQL replacements focus heavily on querying while largely overlooking insertion and updating?I get why querying gets more attention, insertions are usually straightforward and don’t need much simplification. Updates, on the other hand, can be a bit trickier since they often involve modifying data derived from complex queries. These tools seem geared toward data analysis and not data generation, which is ok: is nice focusing on a single problem and solving it "right".But! for projects where a single person handles data creation, analysis, and management, it feels cumbersome to use one set of tools for querying ("R" in CRUD) and another for creation, updates, and deletions ("C," "U," and "D"). I think a "SQL replacement" or approach covering all of CRUD could be interesting for projects of any scale. Something that I could pick instead of shopping for ORMs and/or lightweight query generators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great; I have been thinking about this for a long time. I like reading about past and current implementations that try to better sql; from a programming and a data science and performance perspective. I am aware of the ones you linked and some others like 'Real' (shakti.com) sql and some enhancements from papers.Anyway; nice one! Will try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231325</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone. Posting on HN for the first time.
I'd like to share Rill - a toolkit for composable channel-based concurrency, that makes it easy to build concurrent programs from simple, reusable partsExample of what it looks like:    // Convert a slice into a channel
    ids := rill.FromSlice([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, nil)


    // Read users from API with concurrency=3
    users := rill.Map(ids, 3, func(id int) (*User, error) {
        return api.GetUser(ctx, id)
    })

    // Process users with concurrency=2
    err := rill.ForEach(users, 2, func(u *User) error {
        if !u.IsActive {
            u.IsActive = true
            return api.SaveUser(ctx, u)
        }
        return nil
    })

    // Handle errors
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)


Key features:  - Makes concurrent code composable and clean
  - Works for both simple cases and complex pipelines
  - Built-in batching support
  - Order preservation when needed
  - Centralized error handling
  - Zero dependencies

The library grew from solving real concurrency challenges in production. Happy to discuss the design decisions or answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm.  Some stuff to like, but I do feel like this should have a big, noticeable cautionary note that it does not wait if you end early (e.g. via Err).  Any pending actions continue running and draining in background goroutines, and are potentially VERY delayed if internal/core.Delay is ever exposed or your funcs sleep.I've seen that kind of pattern lead to TONS of surprise race conditions in user-code, because everyone always thinks that "it returned" means "it's done".  Which is reasonable, nothing else is measurable on the caller side - changing that won't be noticeable by callers and may violate their expectations and cause crashes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks good, similar to https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc which we've been using for a while. Will give this a look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237166</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks pretty nice, good job!
The bookmarks feature is nice actually, but since I have almost a thousand of them saved in my browser, the page tries to load all of them and I couldn't find anything to remove it only from the new tab page.
I'd strongly suggest you to add a simple feature of custom bookmarks, separated from browser bookmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice, I wish you best of luck! I personally haven't seen my "new tab" page in a very long time. What I'm doing instead: in current tab hit Cmd+L to focus on address bar, type query/address hit Option+Enter to open resulted page in a new tab. Skipping a bunch of clicks and the "new tab" page. Should be Ctrl+L Alt+Enter on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks really nice.The first question that pops into my head (being aware that this is a popular category of apps) is: when do people look at blank tabs? Whenever I open a new tab, it's with the intention of entering an address or a search term, and any content would be an unwelcome distraction.I'd be more likely to use something like this if it lived under a regular domain name and I could put it into a pinned tab, personally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:04:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237258</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the concept of flength, which is a measure of the length of a function's code in the context of programming language semantics. It highlights the importance of flength in understanding the structure and efficiency of code execution. The site provides an overview of the theoretical underpinnings, practical implications of flength in programming, and examples that illustrate its application in programming languages that support first-class continuations. The goal is to deepen the understanding of how functions behave and interact within the programming paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge reveals that wildlife monitoring technologies, initially designed for ecological research, are being misappropriated to surveil and intimidate women. The research highlights concerns about the ethical implications of using such technology for harassment, emphasizing the need for stricter regulations to prevent misuse. It calls for greater public awareness and discussions around the dual-use nature of these technologies, which can serve both conservation and harmful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Nobody could have realised that camera traps put in the Indian forest to monitor mammals actually have a profoundly negative impact on the mental health of local women who use these spaces.Most women could have predicted that spycams in a park, run by a government in a country with known issues around women’s rights, would lead to issues.Even governments with incredibly strict rules and indelible audit trails struggle with men in government using their access to data to stalk women. India is not a country known for these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point, this shouldn't really be a massive surprise to anyone. The surprising part comes from the continued inability to predict these scenarios with anything less than 100% accuracy. Does it have a camera, microphone, GPS, lidar or any type of wireless communication, if yes it can and it will be used to monitor, oppress and intimidate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems a lot of modern tech is (ab)used for the purpose of perving. I recently visited a gym which seemed very social media oriented (not dissimilar to most gyms tbh), but as days went by I gathered the impression something weird was going on. I ended up suspecting (but having absolutely no evidence) that the owner or staff was using the cameras to spy on members. Further oddities exist in the reviews for the place, which includes staff walking into the change rooms (of the opposite sex) with naked people there.That's a really long/specific way of saying: wildlife cameras spying on Indian women is an instance of a more general problem.I feel like plausible deniability (e.g. security/monitoring) is so easy that discovering and alleging wrong-doing would be met with little more than shrugging of shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232289</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an introduction to automotive LiDAR technology, explaining its importance in the development of autonomous vehicles. It outlines how LiDAR systems use laser pulses to create high-resolution, three-dimensional maps of the vehicle's surroundings, enhancing perception and safety. The piece discusses various components of LiDAR, including sensors and data processing, while highlighting its advantages over traditional sensors like cameras and radar. Overall, it emphasizes the role of LiDAR in advancing vehicle automation and improving collision avoidance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a reasonable basic overview.I'm surprised that rotating scanners are still used. It's been twenty years since Velodyne built their first one. They work OK, but cost too much. I was expecting flash LIDAR or MEMS mirrors to take over. Continental, the auto parts company, bought the leading flash LIDAR company over a decade ago, but the volume market a big parts company needs never appeared.Waymo is still using rotating LIDARs even for the little ones at the vehicle corners. Those need less range. There needs to be a cheap, flush-mounted replacement for those things. The location is too vulnerable. Maybe millimeter phased array radar mounted behind Fiberglas body panels.
Waymo needs to solve that problem before they do New York.The LIDAR on top may not be a problem. Insisting that it has to go away to "look like a car" is like insisting that cars had to have the form factor of horse-propelled buggies. Early cars looked like buggies, but that didn't last.One big advantage of pulsed LIDAR over continuous is that the interference problem between identical units is much less. The duty cycle is tiny. Data from one pulse round trip is collected in less than a microsecond. Just put some randomization in the pulse timing and getting multiple conflicts in a row goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an interesting "lidar gem" from Hacker News a few years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33554679Lidar obstacle detection algorithm from a Git repo leaked onto TorThis is a drivable region mapping (obstacle detection) algorithm found in what appears to be a git repo leaked from an autonomous vehicle company in 2017. The repo was available through one or more Tor hidden services for several years.The lidar code appears to be written for the Velodyne HDL-32E. It operates in a series of stages, each stage refining the output of the previous stage. This algorithm is in the second stage. It is the primary obstacle detection method, with the other methods making only small improvements.The leaked code uses a column-major matrix of points and it explicitly handles NaNs (the no-return points). We've rewritten it to use a much more cache-efficient row-major matrix layout and a conditional that will ignore the NaN points without explicit testing.This is an amazingly effective method of obstacle detection, considering its simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are LIDAR dangerous to the eyes of other drivers or pedestrians?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239721</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the `let` syntax in OCaml, explaining its various uses and structures. It details how `let` is employed for variable binding, defining functions, and pattern matching. The author also explores advanced features such as `let ... in` constructs, recursive definitions, and the scoping rules that govern `let` expressions. Through examples and explanations, the piece emphasizes the flexibility and power of `let` in functional programming within OCaml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182620"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is a little inflammatory. The critique is specifically about Ocaml’s handling of let-bindings. AFAICT OP thinks the syntax sucks because:1. there’s no marker to indicate the end of let scopes2. functions are bound with the same syntax as constantsHe asserts that this is confusing. In practice - for the many issues I have with Ocaml! - neither of these are actual issues, in my experience, once code formatting is applied.An actual serious problem with Ocaml’s syntax is that matches don’t have a terminator, leading people to mess up nested matches frequently. Pair that with the parser’s poor error reporting/recovery and things can become unpleasant quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more I used ocaml the more I found beauty in the syntax. It’s very ergonomic in many ways:1. It’s whitespace insensitive, which means I can code something up really messy and the code formatted will automatically fix it up for me.2. In general there aren’t a ton of punctuation characters that are very common, which is great for typing ergonomics. Don’t get me wrong, there are still a lot of symbols, but I feel compared to some languages such as Rust, they’re used a lot less.Beyond the syntax, there are a couple of things I really like about the language itself:1. Due to the way the language is scoped, whenever you encounter a variable you don’t recognize, you simply have to search in the up direction to find its definition, unless it’s explicitly marked as “rec”. This is helpful if you’re browsing code without any IDE tooling, there’s less guessing involved in finding where things are defined. Downside: if the “open” keyword is used to put all of a module’s values in scope, you’re usually gonna have a bad time.2. The core language is very simple; in general there are three kinds of things that matter: values, types, and modules. All values have a type, and all values and types are defined in modules.3. It’s very easy to nest let bindings in order to help localize the scope of intermediate values.4. It has a very fast compiler with separate compilation. The dev cycle is usually very tight (oftentimes practically instantaneous).5. Most of the language encourages good practice through sane defaults, but accessing escape hatches to do “dirty” things is very easy to do.6. The compiler has some restrictions which may seem arcane, such as the value restriction and weak type variables, but they are valuable in preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot, and they enable some other useful features of the language such as local mutation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe OCaml's syntax does suck, but I don’t think this article gives a compelling argument as to why. Missing an `in` turns a let expression into a top level binding and kicks a syntax error often a long way down the file, making it very hard to identify the cause. The relative precedence of let, if, match, fun, and the semicolon is unintuitive and hard to remember, making me want to add loads of unnecessary and ugly parentheses.On the other hand, I like that there's little overloaded syntax, and the meaning of different characters is fairly consistent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:05:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182620</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the significance of small brain networks in processing information and executing complex behaviors. It highlights how these networks, often overlooked in favor of larger brain structures, play a crucial role in the efficiency and adaptability of cognitive functions. The piece delves into various studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these small networks in both humans and animals, underscoring their potential in understanding brain disorders and informing neuroscience research. Ultimately, it advocates for a re-evaluation of the importance of small-scale neural connections in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to mention is that as far as I know, biological neurons are much more complex than artificial ones. They spike and have a lot more internal states (I think).I wonder if we might see more neuromorphic AI hardware (at competitive scale) soon in order to get away from the extreme energy requirements by (hopefully) packing more capability into fewer artificial neurons and/or a more efficient implementation of the neurons.Every time I see another headline about the plans for giant AI datacenters I expect the next one to be about memristors or some new paradigm with a huge investment coming out of a lab and into a competitive chip. I think that every dollar that goes into a giant AI datacenter should be matched with trying to make new hardware paradigms for AI competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they track the brain activity of a fruit fly? That seems incredible to me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The scientists monitored the brains of fruit flies as they walked on tiny rotating foam balls in the dark, and recorded the activity of a network of cells responsible for keeping track of head direction.Meanwhile I chimp out when I have to plug 4 wires in a relay module.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42170721</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconceptions surrounding employee performance and how it is often related to innate capabilities rather than external factors. It emphasizes the importance of considering the context in which employees work, including management practices, team dynamics, and organizational culture, which can significantly impact performance outcomes. The author argues for a more holistic approach to evaluating employee performance that takes these elements into account, rather than relying solely on individual metrics or evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Performance management, as practiced in many large corporations in 2024, is an outdated technology that is in need of an updateAuthor made a couple of fundamental mistakes: the first is they assume employees are (or should be) paid according to how much they "individually" earned the company. Employers strive to pay employees the minimum they can bear, on employer's terms. Those terms are information asymmetry and a Gaussian distribution. Fairness is the last thing one should expect from employers, but being honest about this is not good for morale, so instead, they rely on keeping employees uninformed, while the employers collude to gather everyone's remuneration history via the Work Number.The second mistake they made is assume that companies would prioritize being lean and trimming the mediocre &amp; bottom 5%. There are other considerations, combined productivity is more important than having individual superstars working on the shiniest features. How much revenue do you think a janitor or café staffer generates? Close to zero. The same goes for engineering. Someone has to do the unglamorous staff, or you end up with a dysfunctional company, with amazing talent (on paper).Edit: there's an infamous graph that shows when aggregate worker productivity and average income. The two tracked closely, rising in tandem until the 1970s, where they got decoupled. With income becoming much flatter, and productivity continuing to rise. That's how the world has been for the past 50 years on the macro and the micro&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"IQ is Gaussian" – it was pointed out somewhere, and only then became obvious to me, that IQ is not Gaussian. The distribution is manufactured.If you have 1000 possible IQ questions, you can ask a bunch of people those questions, and then pick out 100 questions that form a Gaussian distribution. This is how IQ tests are created.This is not unreasonable... if you picked out 100 super easy questions you wouldn't get much information, everyone would be in the "knows quite a lot" category. But you could try to create a uniform distribution, for instance, and still have a test that is usefully sensitive. But if you worry about the accuracy of the test then a Gaussian distribution is kind of convenient... there's this expectation that 50th percentile is not that different than 55th percentile, and people mostly care about that 5% difference only with 90th vs 95th. (But I don't think people care much about the difference between 10th percentile and 5th... which might imply an actual Pareto distribution, though I think it probably reflects more on societal attention)Anyway, kind of an aside, but also similar to what the article itself is talking about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would feel better if this was derived from empirical data rather than just rhetoric.  This seems super testable, no? There is probably a ton of data already in different industries with regards to productivity.Even if human talent have a Pareto distribution (which is not clear), the people employed by a company are a selected sub-set of that population, which would likely have a different distribution depending on how they are selected and the task at hand.I think that any of these simplified distributions are likely not generalizable across companies and industries (e.g. productivity of AWS or Google employees are likely not distributed like employees of MacDonalds or Wal*Mart because of the difference in hiring procedures and the nature of the tasks.)Get hard data within the companies and industry you are in and then you can make some arguments.  Otherwise, I feel it is too easy to just be talking up a sand castle that has no solid footing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42236841</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do something similar, but instead of `insteadOf`, I just clone the repo with `gh-work:org/repo`, and in the git config:    [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:gh-work:**/**"]
        path = ~/.gitconfig.d/gh-work.inc

So, any git repo cloned with the ssh identity defined under `gh-work` will take on the config of `gh-work.inc`, which includes the git identity, and also the same signing key as in the ssh config.Essentially, the name `gh-work` becomes the distinguishing element  in both my ssh identity and my git identity, and I find this easier to think about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work at a startup with a character who would set his identity to be random fairytale-sounding nonsense, changing every day.  So his commits on Monday would be attributed to Mr. Bunnymann, and Tuesday would be Doctor Funtime, etc.It was super unhelpful when trying to do version control forensics.  But if I'm being generous, I think maybe he was trying to remind everyone that anyone can put anything in their identity config, and we shouldn't trust whatever is in there for all that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One even-better approach IMHOJust keep a .gitconfig in your HOME with aliases for your identities. Then just after initializing/cloning the repo do git config-company or git config-personal    er453r@r7:~$ cat ~/.gitconfig 
    [user]
        useConfigOnly = true
    [alias]
        config-personal = !echo CONFIG-PERSONAL &amp;&amp; \

&lt;p&gt;Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, is steadily gaining popularity and traction, positioning itself as a significant competitor to Meta's Threads. Users are attracted to Bluesky for its emphasis on privacy, user control, and unique features that distinguish it from traditional social media offerings. As more people seek alternatives to mainstream platforms, Bluesky's growth reflects a broader trend of dissatisfaction with existing social media giants and a desire for more decentralized and user-centric options. The article highlights the factors contributing to Bluesky's rise and its potential to reshape the social media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Adam Mosseri shared in the beginning of November that they have 275 million monthly active users. Bluesky meanwhile has 20 million total users. Considering the author hasn't shared a single source for their claim, I find it hard to believe. Realistically he is off by at least an order of magnitude.Mashable used to be one of my go-to blogs, but I haven't been there in a while. Has it really fallen this far?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's inevitable that social media will split up into separate and distinct networks of people who can no longer stand or even undertand the other sociopolitical tribes.All of us sharing a singular global network was an exceptional and ephemeral circumstance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231148</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of intentionally reducing the quality of one's internet connection and the potential benefits of doing so. It explores reasons why individuals might want to create a "bad" connection, such as limiting distractions, enhancing focus, or fostering better interpersonal interactions. The piece also suggests practical methods for achieving this, including adjusting settings on devices or using specific applications, while emphasizing the importance of balancing connectivity and disconnection in today's digital age. Overall, it advocates for a more mindful approach to internet usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; and a complete 15-second connectivity dropout every few minutes?&gt; I can’t seem to emulate the connection dropout, but the 10% packet loss should be harsh enough. ... Still, it’s Bad Enough.)The total dropout is surprisingly bad, probably because it kills a lot of "are we alive?" checks... then when things come back, they all hammer the crappy link and everything just dies in a way that all too often doesn't recover.Seriously, more developers need to eat their own dogfood on the subway, or in the back of a grocery store that's surprisingly well RF-shielded, or in a modern steel-reinforced-concrete building but without WiFi (so you're on cellular data which can't quite make it through the building skin), or....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Discord will sometimes just kick you to a loading screen if it thinks your internet isn’t working. If it doesn’t do that, it works pretty okay.On Android, falling back to EDGE/EGPRS makes Discord just not work at all. I get it - downloading profile pictures and media is something you cannot realistically expect, but being able to receive notifications and text content on currently selected channel is a problem that should have been solved way before $current_year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure if the author will be reading this, but I was just curious after reading it's pronoun page, it says it prefers to refer to itself in the third person inanimate, but uses first person pronouns in this article. Are the pronoun choices new, or was there some other choice made specifically for this article?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:06:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232620</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual part is nice and Landing page and slick. However, I am not trolling but what happens when NextJS is no longer the hot commodity that it is today. I would prefer a Visual CMS that lets me do all this but the output should always be static HTML/CSS/JS. Most tools either do the visual part well but fail at the output or vice versa. I don't mind if the stack is NextJS or whatever but the final output should be a static HTML. Bonus if you can push to deploy to Netlify/Cloudflare Pages/S3 etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this is the next standard for CMS-style sites. I'm eagerly waiting for the thing that's easy enough for non-coders to use that doesn't make the code-capable maintainers want to cry mercy.I was pretty optimistic about netlify-cms the approach they took just missed the mark on some technical things that NextJS handles as part of the framework.Best of luck!  IMO there's still lots of opportunity in visual site builders, and this one looks like it has a lot of potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intro graphic shows someone building a website with the title: "Leveraging AI to solve the world's biggest problems"At first glance this gives the impression that Reweb is some sort of LLM-aided "describe what you want it to build" toolBut (unless I misunderstood) it's mostly a WYSIWYG tool, albeit there does seem to be an "AI theme generation" component&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232424</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Pilgrim Historian" explores the life and contributions of William Bradford, a key figure in early American history and the Governor of the Plymouth Colony. It highlights Bradford's role in documenting the experiences of the Pilgrims and the establishment of their community in New England through his work "Of Plymouth Plantation." The piece emphasizes his importance as a historian who shaped the understanding of the Pilgrim story, detailing the challenges faced by the settlers and their interactions with Native Americans. Bradford's writings are portrayed as crucial in preserving the legacy of the Pilgrims and their significance in American history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pilgrimage is as old as religion itself. It is encouraged in Abrahamic religions, but is a core activity in ancient religions like Hinduism, where there are pilgrimage sights dotted all over India (with some lying as far away as Afghanistan). These are like mini quests; you can do this mission where you visit the 11 Krishna sites, or this another mission where you have to reach these 15 sites, but they are all on mountains, and you have to walk 10k steps to reach there...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pilgrimages were still a big thing among early Christians.For example, in Acts 20:16 it notes how Paul was trying to be in Jerusalem for Pentecost. Now this was around 55 AD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42218820</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article highlights the fascinating work of caving scientists who explore some of the most remote and darkest places on Earth, such as extensive cave systems. These scientists aim to understand the unique ecosystems, geology, and the potential for discovering new species within these subterranean environments. The piece discusses the challenges and dangers of caving expeditions, the technologies used for exploration, and the broader implications of their discoveries for biodiversity and conservation. Overall, it underscores the importance of these hidden realms in advancing scientific knowledge and preserving natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a ton of limestone caves there. Many aren't mapped or really marked at all, especially when you get in the bluffs along the Mississippi.I stopped when I got stuck in a tight passage and almost drowned in a flash flood. Caves seem like these super cool places and they're climate controlled so they seemed kind of, I don't know, soft?Then I figured out they're not and they're really really really fucking dangerous. Oh, the stupid stuff 20 year olds get up to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most insane kind of caving I've ever seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOLDGaooQI (cave diving 245 meters deep)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You couldn't pay me enough to squeeze myself in narrow tunnels underground. But I'm glad there are brave explorers who can do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232952</guid></item><item><title>29.

The requirement first for a shared physical space, in the age of remote working. Secondly the need for programs to fit on a table, which his simple examples even seem to barely do. In a meeting you'd have to be constantly arranging things on the table, putting things away as you move on to the next example, remembering how to arrange the next deck etc.. personally if I do a presentation, I want all the slides on the cloud in case of any issues, not to be carrying round a set of cards in a binder..I would think the more likely next step in combatting complexity, would be personalised AIs. These would understand the context of the presentation being given, and therefore can provide us remote audience members with explanations and visualisations on demand, that would suit our level of understanding of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the title saying "summary" and the date, this is a complete (and new) video&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:31 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239344</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bah. I thought this was going to be cool passive noise reduction but it’s active.Back in the 90’s someone figured out these little hollow beads that ate sound. They talked about how we could paint them on walls to dampen whole rooms, or things like airplanes.Since we never heard from them again, even after the patents would have expired, I suspect that they couldn’t find a binder that adhered to the beads without filling in the holes. Or the paint neutralizes the effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sound, an omnipresent sensory stimulator, holds significant relevance in the human experience, as it continually engages our auditory and mental faculties.This first sentence makes it seem as if the paper was written by aliens. Not even deaf people would gain anything from that sentence.I think LLMs have caused me to be more perceptive to and annoyed by stuff like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apologies for the ADHD induced tangent.  Has anyone else noticed that regular little party balloons seem to have a passive noise cancelling effect?  If you bring them close to your ear there's a zone of 'dead air' when they are maybe an inch away.  My theory was that there's something in passing through the rubber envelope that creates a phase delay or inversion, but it could just all be in my head lol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:07:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235909</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the investigation into IP Edge, a patent-assertion firm often associated with aggressive litigation tactics, revealing findings that could lead to criminal referrals. It highlights a federal judge's concerns over IP Edge's practices, including the use of "patent trolls" to exploit the legal system for financial gain. The investigation's results underline the ongoing challenges posed by patent trolling in the tech industry and point to potential legal consequences for those involved in such predatory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the French Wikipedia:https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_BrevetsFrance Brevets (FB) was an intellectual property investment fund created by the French State, the National Research Agency (ANR), and the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations. The entity was created on June 9, 2011 as a simplified joint-stock company. It received 50 million euros. This capital was subsequently increased to 100 million. Its activity was negotiating the rights to the patents for which it was responsible. In particular, it could gather patents to propose a coherent offer to the lessees, or even look for new areas of use. It was part of the French public policy known as competitiveness clusters, to support the country's industrial activity.Faced with the structure's lack of profitability, pointed out several times by the Court of Auditors, the French State requested the cessation of France Brevets's activity, a decision ratified on October 20, 2022, by the board of directors.France Brevets is criticized for having a "patent troll" type of activity and is taking legal action against companies such as the Taiwanese HTC or the Korean LG without industrial production.In addition, the granting of public subsidies to an SAS would be contrary to Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Therefore the very status of France Brevets would be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19 additional comments here,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42086555&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; France Brevets was set to receive 35% of any revenue related to “monetizing and enforcement” of the patent, with Burley agreeing to file at least one patent infringement lawsuit within a year, and collect a “total minimum Gross Revenue of US $100,000” within 24 months, or the patent rights would be given back to France Brevets.This is insane to me, it sounds almost like the patent holders are leasing out patents to anyone who is willing to work as a patent troll and chance their arm at some payouts, otherwise they have to return the Patent?I mean that just sounds like a new level of low for patent troll farming entirely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234147</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I lived overseas for a time in an area that didn't use English. I loved it, enjoyed being there, but one day I noticed that I was talking to myself! At first, it was just exclamations out loud (quietly) when something happened around me. It progressed to me describing or evaluating my meal, a book, a scene I was looking at. I realized it when I noticed ppl looking at me strangely (they normally did anyway), and as I looked back wondering why they were looking at me, it hit! I had been talking out loud to myself, normal volume! Why? I figure it was loneliness; but loneliness for hearing English. I was the only one who could speak it! And then it hit me again, a new found epiphany about all those "crazy homeless" ppl who I'd seen back home, muttering to themselves as they wander around. What if, instead of (or in addition to) being mentally unwell, they were just lonely, and having no one to talk to led to them talking to themselves? Whoa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's considered himself lonely for most of his life, I can very much relate with the idea of feeling like an outcast, like an alien, someone who doesn't really fit in or understand what others find interest in. I think, in my case at least, it was probably related to being told over and over as I kid that I was doing everything wrong, that I wasn't acting manly enough, etc. Being told I didn't fit in led me to believe it. After a long journey of rebuilding my self-worth, I'm a lot less lonely this days, but I still feel it pulling at me, especially when I'm in a situation where I feel like an outsider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intuitively, this makes perfect sense.Non-lonely people interact with one another, continuously exposing themselves to each others views and opinions (even if indirectly).A lonely person won't be part of this echo chamber, so their opinions will usually be self-formed and less influenced by the collective opinion of others.It's easy to see how this creates a feedback loop. A lonely person doesn't share as many worldviews with non-lonely people, so has a harder time fitting in, which makes breaking the cycle even harder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:21 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234695</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits of using a projector as a replacement for a traditional monitor in a home office setup. It explores how projectors can provide a larger display area, enhance collaboration, and save space. The author shares their personal experience and evaluates various projector models suitable for different needs, emphasizing factors like resolution, brightness, and connectivity. The piece also offers practical tips on setting up a projector effectively, suggesting considerations for lighting and screen placement to optimize the work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using a pair of RayNeo Air 2 "XR" glasses for the past week. "Xtended Reality" is not really true VR, but instead, simply provides a huge 1080p screen in the middle of your field of vision. They're flawed in a handful of ways, especially with blur/visibility around the edges. I need to increase the font size to read with them. Despite those flaws, it's extremely liberating to be able to position myself in any way I want and still be able to see the main focus of my work. I think I'll just keep investing in glasses like these and never buy another monitor ever again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;isn't 1080p resolution too low for that size?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience with projectors is that they are noisy, power hungry beasts with display quality far inferior to monitors. Has that changed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:08:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232741</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a pivotal moment in Valve's history when a summer intern played a crucial role in averting a potentially disastrous lawsuit for the company. The intern's quick thinking and timely email communication helped to resolve a conflict with a publisher that had unexpectedly escalated, illustrating the significant impact that an individual can have within a major organization. The piece highlights the intern's experience and the broader implications of this event for Valve and the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In an era of massive scale companies and giant projects, it's fascinating how often it feels like most of the success of a project or company's big successes ultimately hinge on the actions of a few key individuals in the right place at the right time - and it never fails to surprise me how little overlap these individuals and the actual actual company org charts share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mentioned in the article, but the source is the excellent YouTube documentary Valve released for Half-Life 2's 20th Anniversary [0][0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's food for thought that something as groundbreaking as HL2 and Steam almost didn't see the light of day and the developers only survived by the skin of their teeth. In some nearby universe the games industry looks very different and sometimes people go "remember Half-Life? It's a shame Valve went out of business and the sequel was canceled."I wonder what other amazing things we missed out on because of political backstabbing, or one-sided corporate lawsuits, or crime and fraud? We'll never know, because those projects don't get documentaries made about them 20 years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42191328</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on GitHub's roadmap outlines community suggestions and feature requests for improving GitHub's platform, focusing on enhancements to collaboration tools, user interface improvements, and overall usability. Contributors share their insights and recommend changes that could enhance developers' workflows, promote better project management, and facilitate easier communication among users. The conversation emphasizes the importance of community feedback in shaping GitHub's future developments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why you don’t announce future changes until they’re essentially ready to go out the door. Apple used to understand this better than most. Until you build the feature, you’ll have people asking you constantly when it’ll be done. After you build it, you’ll have people complaining that it doesn’t work exactly like they imagined it in their head. If you end up not building it and say so, you’ll get attacked for it, even by people who never knew about the plans before the cancellation.Keep quiet about internal plans only you can affect. Let features requests come to you, monitor interest in those, and reply if they’re interesting or not feasible, so you can discuss and figure out what would work best for your users. Engage but don’t commit unless you’re certain something will happen.I’m surprised the conversation hasn’t devolved to a bigger mess yet (maybe it’s being well moderated). It’s a shame they’re having to preemptively lock issues, but I completely get it. It’s exhausting having to deal with abuse on public forums when you’re on the receiving end and always have to keep your conposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only one that directly annoys me is not being able to have threaded comments at the PR level. https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/552 You can do it with "quoting", which is fine if there are two of you but turns into a mess if there's more than that.They've said that they're watching the discussions for feedback, so I hope they listen and implement that one.Happy that they are being transparent (rather than letting the issues rot), annoyed that they appear to be prioritising marginally useful AI stuff for basic UX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going to stick my neck out here.A lot of these "improvements" fall into the following 3 categories:1) More complexity around issue tracking2) More complexity around permissions3) IDE-ness and general visual-studioification of the web interface.Since many of the issues make GitHub bloated and more difficult to use for general use cases, they _should_ be removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234415</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept that there are hidden or obscured narratives throughout history that have significant implications for our understanding of the world. It delves into various events, figures, and philosophies that have been overlooked or misrepresented in mainstream historical discourse. The piece highlights the importance of re-examining these narratives to gain a fuller understanding of human civilization and cultural heritage.

To keep the city at bay he employed his own private police force and set up toll gates, which is where we get the name Brooks Bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This was simply how cities worked: the elite in the centre, the poor on the outskirts.That checks out today as well - at least in Europe. Difference being that we have mass transit now, so everything close to stops is also more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"""
developers were coming in with proposals to demolish the Victorian villas in the area so that they could build apartments. We decided to designate it as a conservation area so that nothing could be knocked down without our permission.

I often see it referenced when digital audio gets explained.It is also very insiduously misleading in a way that is hard to fault it for.That "band limited signal" that uniquely satisfies Niquist theorem? That is an infinite, periodic signal.No finite (e. g. a song), aperiodic signal can be band limited. That includes any signal with transients.Well, how big is the difference? How much overhead/error/lookahead is needed to approach the Niquist result? It is never mentioned by people referring to this theorem when talking about audio signal sampling!And I wish it was mentioned and explained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A classic.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses whether identification is necessary to read the REAL ID regulations, highlighting that while no ID is required to access the rules themselves, understanding and compliance with them may necessitate verifying identity for some individuals. It emphasizes the importance of awareness regarding ID requirements for air travel and federal facilities, and outlines the various scenarios where identification becomes crucial. The piece ultimately clarifies the distinction between accessing information and the need for ID in different contexts related to REAL ID enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're going to joust windmills, these are some good windmills to joust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; These mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) will be issued by state driver’s license agencies, but the standards incorporated into the TSA rule require that they be deployed through smartphone platforms (i.e. Google and/or Apple) and operate through government apps that collect photos of users and log usage of these credentials.This is really disturbing in a number of different ways.  It's bad enough to have the government requiring you to have a government-approved smart phone, but on top of that it's the logging and data analysis wet dream that authoriarian governments the world over could have only dreamed of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to Mr. Hasbrouck, who I assume is the narrator, for putting feet to ground to demonstrate the lack of open access to executive branch law.You can't have a law, and also keep it secret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:09:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239952</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of meritocracy in college admissions and how it contributes to social and economic segregation. It critiques the notion that merit-based systems are fair, pointing out that access to resources, opportunities, and quality education is often unevenly distributed, favoring affluent students. The piece argues for a reevaluation of admissions processes to better account for students' varied backgrounds and to promote equity in higher education, ultimately questioning the ideals of meritocracy in a deeply unequal society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long essay, but I agree with a lot of what's said.I think a lot of quality time is wasted due to the rat race starting in early childhood.I live in a bit of a bubble in the commuter belt around London (ie not the US), but I observe some of the same obsessions here as well. In particular, I started to notice that my kid's friends suddenly had a lot less time for playdates in the year or two leading up to the 11-plus exam, which is a selective school thing. There are similar exams for the private schools in the area. Of course what was happening was that their parents would hire a tutor to help them pass the tests.The effect of this tutoring is on the whole negative. Obviously, it costs money. It also costs time that your kid would have to do other things. But also, it gives the kids the impression that school is super important, and they will be valued based on the outcome of this test. You end up with a few percent who get into the top selective schools, and everyone else is left with low expectations.Inevitably, it also means that it becomes a game for rich parents. I went to the induction day at the fancy school, and guess what. The parents are a bunch of professionals, virtually nobody doing anything else, and most kids went to private primaries + got tutored. We must have left some poor but capable kids in the wrong school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Number one people go to number one schools” is how one lawyer explained her firm’s recruiting principle to Rivera.What a load of number two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something missing is deindustrialization following WW2. The US northeast (where "Ivy League" schools are located) shifted a huge amount of industry to other parts of the country, where factories had been established during the war. A few years later, the south had more electoral votes than the northeast and midwest. The votes determine leaders, not educational institutions.Look at the electoral votes from 1956:NY: 45 
PA: 32 
TX: 24 
FL: 10Today:NY: 28 
PA: 19 
TX: 40 
FL: 30Texas and Florida doubled their influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233651</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the prevalent belief in a "loneliness epidemic" in modern society, arguing that while loneliness is indeed a significant issue, the notion that it has reached unprecedented levels is misleading. The author examines various studies and cultural narratives surrounding loneliness, suggesting that social isolation may not be as widespread as claimed. Moreover, the piece highlights the complexity of loneliness and social connection, emphasizing the importance of community and relationship quality over sheer numbers of social interactions. Ultimately, it encourages a nuanced understanding of loneliness rather than a simplistic interpretation of its prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article seems to a lot of fluff, but one thing I generally dislike in arguments is pulling some historical period, quoting similar complaints from that time, and using this to imply that because a problem has existed before it's the norm.History has had many ups and down, and instead of saying that anything is "normal", you should ask if those periods really were downturns that needed solutions.Societies have always had issues, but that doesn't mean that the issues we have right now are not something to be addressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2021 US census found that the average American spent 2 hours 45 minutes with their friends per week. A decade before that it was 6.5. It's probably been replaced by online interaction, but it is online interaction that feels so lonely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article pokes holes and casts doubt on a concept of a loneliness epidemic, just to conclude, "Americans have been repeatedly warned about loneliness and about the loss of friendship. The alarms, of course, may not always be false. History might prove the 2010s to be one of those times where there was some reason for concern — at least about young men." And then "...because false alarms come with a price, particularly in diverting our attention from other, less amorphous matters, such as economic dislocations, violence, and real epidemics."If you put the bottom line up front, the rest of the article doesn't support that conclusion. It doesn't address the resources that we're spending on loneliness, or what's a better use of those resources.There's another swing and a miss for the conclusion a little earlier too. "If there has been increasing chatter about loneliness, then, it has been more the result of higher expectations and greater self-reflection — especially among the chattering classes — rather than greater isolation."So people aren't more lonely, they just feel more lonely. But that's not true loneliness. Again, you could write an interesting article on that, but this article isn't.This article ultimately comes off as a call to inaction because the alternative is believing there's a loneliness epidemic and being tempted to do something about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:41 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42238160</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;I'm unable to access external content like YouTube videos directly. However, if you provide a brief description or key points about the video, I can help you summarize or analyze that information!&lt;/p&gt;

Which isn't to say it's wrong or misleading, just that reality is messier, and there are mental models you have for how orgs work that are only models of reality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or, as a startup, maybe you want to be taking more shots on goal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:10:51 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42180746</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to resign from the Royal Society, outlining various reasons behind this choice. The author expresses concerns about the organization's lack of transparency, its handling of scientific debates, and issues related to inclusivity and diversity. They feel that the society has strayed from its mission to promote science and that these changes have impacted their ability to contribute effectively. The resignation serves as a personal statement on the need for scientific institutions to uphold their core values and advocate for open dialogue in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I respect the author's principle-based approach but many of her arguments seem a little off. If the RS doesn't expel people for their politics, then it doesn't make sense to expel Musk for, essentially, concerns about his politics. And if you expel crotchety scientists for disagreeing with the scientific consensus there won't be any left. The RS motto is literally "Take nobody's word for it"; I don't see how Musk disagreeing with other's opinions could possibly be grounds for removing him.That being said, Musk does seem like a vaguely inappropriate addition to the Society. His wikipedia page suggests he doesn't have a PhD, doesn't do any research and is involved in military matters for an army foreign to the UK. He's obviously being included because he has lots of money and it isn't clear to me if that is proper or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To quote him "Whereas previously he seemed to agree with mainstream scientific opinion"
Can someone please explain to me how we managed to get a whole generation of the western scientific thinkers who think the scientific method is consensus of scientific opinion? The author lists Isaac Newton, Hooke, Boyle . All of these prominent minds made scientific breakthroughs that didn't stick to the consensus views of the time.People interested should look at The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Kuhn.To quote from Wikipedia:
Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of conceptual continuity and cumulative progress, referred to as periods of "normal science", were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All politics aside, is it normal for business people to be elected to the royal society?Even if you think Musk is a genius, it seems hard to label him as a scientist (instead of a CEO of science-related companies).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:11:01 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234497</guid></item></channel></rss>
