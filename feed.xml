            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I genuinely enjoy using Numbers in a way that I just don’t with Excel. Probably more indicative of the level I’m using it at, but for me it fills the gap where I just want to do some quick manipulations of CSV data but not enough that it’s worth writing a script.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I follow the link I am brought to extremely generic Apple support page with exactly zero indication that we are talking about the Numbers app.How do you determine, from this support article, the scope where it applies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Numbers was fully Excel compatible and I could get rid of this Microsoft spyware nonsense.  I even bought WP Office, but even that tries to force you into their cloud drive.I really wish there was a fully compatible Microsoft Office that I could use across my Apple devices that doesn’t shove some random cloud solution and end up with my files spread all over the place.  I would pay more to have a OneDrive less office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581137</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Yann LeCun's insights on the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the challenges surrounding it. It highlights the complexities involved in creating machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities, emphasizing the differences between narrow AI and AGI. LeCun expresses skepticism about the immediate realization of AGI and outlines criteria for evaluating its progress, focusing on benchmarks and testing methods to assess machine intelligence. The piece also touches on the ethical implications of AGI and the potential societal impacts it could have in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Last week, the ARC Prize team released an updated test, called ARC-AGI-2, and it appears to have sent the AIs back to the drawing board. The full o3 model has not yet been tested, but a version of o1 dropped from 32 percent on the original puzzles to just 3 percent on the new version, and a “mini” version of o3 currently available to the public dropped from roughly 30 percent to below 2 percent. (An OpenAI spokesperson declined to say whether the company plans to run the benchmark with o3.) Other flagship models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have achieved roughly 1 percent, if not lower. Human testers average about 60 percent.Arc AGI is the main reason why I don't trust static bench marks.If you don't have an essentially infinite set to draw your validation data from then a large enough model will memorize it as part of its developer teams KPIs.Forget all these fancy benchmarks. If you want to saturate any model today give it a string and a grammar and ask it to generate the string from the grammar. I've had _every_ model fail this on regular grammars with strings of more than 4 characters long.LLMs are the solution to natural language, which is a huge deal. They aren't the solution to reasoning which is still best solved with what used to be called symbolic AI before it started working, e.g. sat solvers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Chollet, a French computer scientist and one of the industry’s sharpest skepticsI feel like this description really buries the lede on Chollet's expertise. (For those who don't know, he's the creator of and lead contributor[0] to Keras)[0]https://github.com/keras-team/keras/graphs/contributors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to dismiss Chollet’s work, but I’m starting to think he need prove nothing to even the muggles. For example, nearly any endurance athlete stands a good chance of being a Strava user. If you run in those circles, have you heard a single person with anything good to say about Strava’s “Athletic Intelligence”? Garmin is rolling out a beta right now that includes “AI Insights” or summat. Same deal: useless summaries like “you ran 5 miles today, which contributes to your aerobic base”. I could do better with a database and some if/else statements. And Garmin wants a subscription for this.  (It’s included in Strava’s subscription, but I suppose you’re still paying for it.) And so now the memes tend toward “dumb AI insight of the day” on many online forums.Seems to me that a lot of folks are enjoying having an LLM rewrite their email or whatever, but I wonder how many are actually buying the rest of it? The companies themselves sure aren’t helping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587628</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the enriching experience of pursuing side projects, emphasizing their potential to foster creativity, enhance skills, and provide a sense of fulfillment. It highlights how engaging in such endeavors can lead to personal growth and stress relief, offering a break from the routine of daily work. The author shares insights on the balance between passion and practicality, encouraging readers to explore interests outside of their main professional responsibilities. Ultimately, it advocates for the value of side projects as a means to cultivate joy and inspiration in one's life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an interesting read. I'm in the complete opposite camp. I can't pick up a game controller for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I'm wasting time.This has lead to many, many side projects throughout the years, which I tend to like a zen garden[1]. Pruning, refining, improving, and sometimes rewriting.As soon as I work out the game mechanics of any game, I just see it as just content now, and there is nothing holding me back to play any longer. Same with watching TV shows or movies, I lose interest pretty quickly and feel an urge to create something.I've always been very in tune with time, our lack of it, and felt like consumption is a waste of time.That said I believe creativity is hormonal (that is only my personal belief, unproven). It comes and goes. Some days I can't stop creating, somedays I want netflix and chill. But that's 10 days cycle of sorts, 10 days on, 10 days off.Depending on where you live, it's perfectly normal that due to current events, or a personal loss in your life, etc. you might not feel the creative bug tickling you. The creative hormone might be totally wiped by your current environment or predicament; tiredness, anger, stress, all play into it.After all, since our early days in the caves, drawing on walls, Humans wouldn't do so unless they had safety, a full belly, and a warm fire. A place to call home. Creative time needs conditions to be filled.[1] https://noben.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just thinking about this yesterday. A few weeks or months ago I started learning something new from an online course.Because I like using Anki to help me remember, I started copy-pasting stuff from that course to a spreadsheet to then export it as a CSV to import into Anki.One thing leading to another, my spreadsheet quickly ended with weird formatting everywhere that would be converted through macros to HTML tags to style the resulting Anki notes.This was still implying much manual work, so I finally figured I could just scrape the lessons for which I want notes via some script, and get the resulting CSV with a simple command.I'm been working on that scraper for two weeks now, and I just realised yesterday that that's the most time I've spent on a side project since too long to remember, and it brings me joy and motivation in the evenings and weekends. Also, apart from the occasional script, I haven't wrote a line of code for years, and I don't know why I ever stopped coding since I love this so much. And last but not least, I decided to go for Python, and I've never learnt Python so it's quite a challenge but also a satisfactory experience.All in all, this side project is spaghetti code with a dirty hacks sauce, I would never open-source it,  and it's never going to be useful for someone other than me.But it feels like I'm dusting off my brain, and rediscovering skills and passions I had long forgotten. Like finally waking from a long slumber. I'm currently a bit depressed, struggle to focus, and feel burnt out, but at least I am motivated by something and I create something for me, and this makes all the rest bearable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel this in my bones.  Side projects are so cathartic and saved my sanity at $DAYJOB.  I don't care that I can't implement things the way I want, or how everything is spaghetti, or how much tech debt has piled up, my side projects is a blissful world that I invented.  It gives me the "I am Jack's crap codebase" fight club zen at work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43587380</guid></item><item><title>2.

Looks its here:https://www.morphosource.org/catalog/media?locale=enBut you need to register account and file a request for each download.Edit: ok there is a filter option "Publication Status: Open Download" which gives you download without filing a request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Error 405 Slovenian users must use proxy.The project sounds interesting, but I can't see what it's about because they've apparently blacklisted (?) my entire country.ETA: Looks like this is just a news article. Perhaps linking the (less discriminatory) primary source would be a better idea: https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/gallery/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What might be an efficient way to view these if you don't work with 3-D models often.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tried it for a bit. Paid one month of the subscription.The dashboard is incredibly clunky and at the time they didn't have SSL for db connections (not sure about now). A lot of stuff you need to know what you're doing like configuring tags for Traefik etc.The deal breaker was it didn't have zero downtime deploys. Any pending request when you update an app is simply killed.I was expecting something like Heroku or Vercel but this ain't it.Ended up concluding that if I wanted to run/deploy apps on my own VPS I'd just use Kamal or Dokku. Both have zero downtime deploys, certbot, proxy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was also looking at alternatives -K8S-based
-https://github.com/cozystack/cozystackhttps://github.com/kubero-dev/kuberohttps://github.com/pluralsh/pluralDCR-based
-https://github.com/coollabsio/coolifyhttps://github.com/dokku/dokku/https://github.com/Dokploy/dokployhttps://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwaveMost of these projects are maintained by a single maintainer; for business critical apps look elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Coolify for about a year now and have been very happy with it. It's really low maintenance, it has built in backups for your apps and databases, decent security by default, and is super easy to use. I log into the underlying VMs once per month to do an apt update/upgrade, and that's about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555996</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General overview below, as the pages don't seem to be working well  Llama 4 Models:
  - Both Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design with 17B active parameters each.
  - They are natively multimodal: text + image input, text-only output.
  - Key achievements include industry-leading context lengths, strong coding/reasoning performance, and improved multilingual capabilities.
  - Knowledge cutoff: August 2024.

  Llama 4 Scout:
  - 17B active parameters, 16 experts, 109B total.
  - Fits on a single H100 GPU (INT4-quantized).
  - 10M token context window
  - Outperforms previous Llama releases on multimodal tasks while being more resource-friendly.
  - Employs iRoPE architecture for efficient long-context attention.
  - Tested with up to 8 images per prompt.

  Llama 4 Maverick:
  - 17B active parameters, 128 experts, 400B total.
  - 1M token context window.
  - Not single-GPU; runs on one H100 DGX host or can be distributed for greater efficiency.
  - Outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on coding, reasoning, and multilingual tests at a competitive cost.
  - Maintains strong image understanding and grounded reasoning ability.

  Llama 4 Behemoth (Preview):
  - 288B active parameters, 16 experts, nearly 2T total.
  - Still in training; not yet released.
  - Exceeds GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on STEM benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, GPQA Diamond).
  - Serves as the “teacher” model for Scout and Maverick via co-distillation.

  Misc:
  - MoE Architecture: Only 17B parameters activated per token, reducing inference cost.
  - Native Multimodality: Unified text + vision encoder, pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model training observations from both Llama 3 and 4 papers:Meta’s Llama 3 was trained on ~16k H100s, achieving ~380–430 TFLOPS per GPU in BF16 precision, translating to a solid 38 - 43% hardware efficiency [Meta, Llama 3].For Llama 4 training, Meta doubled the compute, using ~32K H100s and switched to FP8 precision. Despite the precision gain, observed efficiency dropped to about 19.7%, with GPUs delivering ~390 TFLOPS out of a theoretical 1,979 FP8 TFLOPS [Meta, Llama 4].I am not the one to critique, and rather, this is a recognition of the enormous complexity of operating GPUs at this scale. Training massive models across tens of thousands of GPUs stretches today’s AI infrastructure to its limit.Besides accelerating inference workloads, advanced GPU optimizations can be integrated into training and fine-tuning pipelines. From various kernel optimization techniques (over 90) to increasing memory access efficiency and scaling up to cluster-wide resource coordination, efficiency can be maximized with some complex software.References:

This is due to the types of training data available on the internet."Perhaps. Or, maybe, "leaning left" by the standards of Zuck et al. is more in alignment with the global population. It's a simpler explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595585</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the importance and impact of advertising in various sectors, emphasizing its role in communicating brand messages and influencing consumer behavior. It outlines different advertising strategies and mediums, ranging from traditional print and broadcast to digital platforms. The site also highlights best practices for effective advertising campaigns, including understanding target audiences and utilizing analytics to measure success. Overall, it serves as a resource for businesses looking to enhance their advertising efforts and connect more effectively with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t stop thinking about this article. I spent a long time in ad tech before switching to broader systems engineering. The author captures something I've struggled to articulate to friends and family about why I left the industry.The part that really struck me was framing advertising and propaganda as essentially the same mechanism - just with different masters. Having built targeting systems myself, this rings painfully true. The mechanical difference between getting someone to buy sneakers versus vote for a candidate is surprisingly small.What's frustrating is how the tech community keeps treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. We debate content moderation policies and algorithmic transparency, but rarely question the underlying attention marketplace that makes manipulation profitable in the first place.The uncomfortable truth: most of us in tech understand that today's advertising systems are fundamentally parasitic. We've built something that converts human attention into money with increasingly terrifying efficiency, but we're all trapped in a prisoner's dilemma where nobody can unilaterally disarm.Try this thought experiment from the article - imagine a world without advertising. Products would still exist. Commerce would still happen. Information would still flow. We'd just be freed from the increasingly sophisticated machinery designed to override our decision-making.Is this proposal radical? Absolutely. But sometimes the Overton window needs a sledgehammer.P.S. If you are curious about the relationship between Sigmund Freud, propaganda, and the origins of the ad industry, check out the documentary “Century of the Self”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fantastic article, I particularly like the point about humanity being more or less ad-free for much of it existence. I was just thinking about absurdity of advertising yesterday. As a life-long football fan (not soccer ;)), I was always bothered by the slow creep-in of those silly, mindless pre- and post-game interviews they do with players and managers nowadays. In the two decades since this has been happening it never occurred to me why these were a thing, until yesterday. In a lead up to a minor game, of course there was an interview with one of the players. In front of one of those panels with repetitive ads for various businesses. As it happens to be the case every time for the last 20ish years. Of course! The interviewees are just providing the mindless content, while my mind absorbs the background ads! So obvious, but it never occurred to me even once. Ad industry is really a cancer on society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This begs the question: how could you reliably distinguish advertising from other forms of free speech?The courts already distinguish "commercial speech" as a class of speech. Would we prevent all forms of commercial speech? What about a waiter asking you "would you like to try a rosé with that dish? It pairs very well together." Is that "advertising" that would need to be outlawed?What about giving out free samples? Is that advertising, and thus should be illegal?What about putting a sign up on your business that says the business name? Is that advertising?I hate advertising and propaganda. But the hard part IMO is drawing the line. Where's the line?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595269</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product manager ex. game designer with a number of puzzle/word game in operation here.- Having a timer (urgency) is usually not a very good idea for thinky games. If you insist on having a timer consider making it count upwards.- Additionally as other commenters mentioned is the game is a time trial it needs an explicit “Start” button. Also stop the timer when user is not playing e.g. reading the rules.- There’s no point of having a “Play again” option for a Wordle style daily game, the thinking part is already done, so any replay is just an exercise in dexterity.- It’s okay to be US-centric actually, doesn’t matter unless you are very serious about monetizing it, and even then being US-centric will work.- Consider showing rules for first time users before staring the puzzle.- Consider having some sort of overarching thing in your puzzle, so it’s not just five words on a specific topic to guess, but something more, like a hidden word across all five etc. This makes a delightful discovery moment and sometimes might work as a clue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On an older iPad I get "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading www.whatsit.today (see the browser console for more information)." neatly centred on an otherwise blank page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One small piece of feedback: typically these games do not allow proper nouns, because there’s too many of them. So having “Catan” be a valid word is pretty awful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593789</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a pivotal episode of "This American Life" that significantly impacted host Ira Glass and the show's direction. It highlights the theme and content of the episode, exploring how it reshaped storytelling techniques and audience engagement. Glass reflects on the challenges faced during production and the subsequent influence this particular installment had on both the radio show and his career. The piece underscores the transformative power of media and personal storytelling in fostering connection and understanding among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

adequately to allege actual malice.”The “not statements of fact” included the reassurances that Carlson always made, in this case he said “Remember the facts of the case. These are undisputed” followed by clearly disputed and false claims.The lawyers argued successfully that it should be clear to the viewer that what Carlson says “cannot reasonably be interpreted as fact” even when he says that these are the facts.Arguably the bigger factor was proving malice, and Carlson seems very careful not to put anything into an email or text that undermines what he says on air.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-yor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes this fascinating isn't just what it says about storytelling, but what it reveals about our relationship with truth in media. I worked in public radio for 7 years, and TAL's influence was impossible to overstate - every producer wanted to craft stories with that perfect narrative arc.The Daisey episode still haunts journalism programs. We used it as a case study in our ethics workshops. The truly unsettling part wasn't just Daisey's fabrications, but how perfectly those lies fit into TAL's storytelling template - dramatic scenes, sympathetic characters, narrative tension, and a tidy resolution that makes you feel something.Glass wasn't wrong about storytelling's power to make people listen. But the Daisey incident showed its dangers - when your format rewards emotional impact and narrative elegance, you create incentives for sources to deliver exactly that, truthful or not.The saddest part is that real stories about Foxconn's labor conditions existed that could have been told without fabrication. But they wouldn't have had that perfect "old man touching an iPad for the first time" moment that makes for such a perfect radio beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43549893</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a proposal for integrating WebAssembly (Wasm) support into the Swift programming language. It outlines the potential benefits of allowing Swift developers to compile their code to Wasm, which would enable the creation of high-performance web applications and improve code sharing across platforms. The discussion includes technical considerations, possible use cases, and the importance of community feedback, encouraging Swift developers to share their thoughts and contribute to the vision for this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting proposal though it does sound a bit too general. “Improve cross compilation”… current Swift tools are barely keeping it together for the “happy path” of building for Apple devices (it’s not that happy). It would be cool to expand into wasm/wasi as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of other desperately needed improvements.Rust, Go and others have been building WASM 0.2 support for many years, they currently have a “just works” support for WASI. It would be a long time until Swift is even remotely ready for something like this and I don’t feel there is a burning need to have “yet another wasm platform”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we have a proper Windows support? i.e. with all the batteries/libraries included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully they make interface types available to the runtime. So you can read/write wasm struct properties from the host without all the usual glue code cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593596</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had one as a friend-pet for a while a few years ago. We went outside one day and found one leaf in our plum tree was tube-shaped with some spiderweb and after some waiting, off  she came (I have no idea if it was male or female but Spanish is a gendered language and spiders are female, so we always referred to it as “her”).Every day around noon she’d come out of her leave and wait to catch an insect. It was amazing to see her precisely jump to get it, and watching her eat was a mix of gross and interesting. I normally dislike spiders (though I don’t kill them unless I really feel threatened) but jumping spiders are an exception and I’d actually describe them as nice, almost pet/friend material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jumping spiders make great pets. The ones I've kept build silk tubes in the upper corners of their terrariums to hide and sleep in, meaning I could see them most of the time. They actively hunt, which is fun to watch. And even the common phidippus audax has bright coloring.  They only live a year or two, but it's cool to watch them grow.Beyond the facts in this article, jumping spiders have also shown spatial reasoning. When they see prey on another leaf behind their jumping range, they'll climb down and find a path to the prey's leaf, even if the prey isn't visible during this detour. They remember it's relative location and seemingly "choose" the best route to get there.Edit: You can also "hand feed" your jumping spider with a cotton swab dipped in sugar water. They drink flower nectar in the wild, so my wife and I tried this and it worked!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;jumping spiders are very cool but god this site sucks to use on mobile. 3

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a detailed overview of a tagless final approach to implementing programming languages in Haskell. It explains how this method enables the construction of interpreters and compilers by representing language constructs as Haskell types and functions, maintaining type safety and modularity. The author discusses the advantages of tagless final over traditional approaches, such as improved composability and ease of extension for programming languages. Additionally, the article provides examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts, aiming to help readers understand the practical applications of the tagless final style in developing language abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just got over writing 2 (well 2.5) toy compilers and I think a lot of the material in the compiler-teaching space lack some subtle developmental aspects.I wish there was a course designed somewhere which talked about more ingrained issues: how to structure/design the AST[0], buffer based vs noncontextual tokenization/parser design, index handling and error sync in the parser, supporting multiple codegen architectures, handling FFI, exposing the compiler as an API for external tooling, namespaces and linkage handling etc. etc. etc.It is refreshing to see how Carbon designed some of its components (majorly the frontend, yet to take a look at the backend) as it touches on some of the subtleties I mentioned. If someone is starting out on writing one, I would recommend taking a look at it or any of the talks.Always nice to see new material coming up. A few resources that I would like to mention would be dabaez's compiler course, Khoury college's compiler course (in Rust, previously i think and Ocaml), Nora Sandler's book as well as http://compilerbook.org; Which I consider to be the best guide out there for writing small learning compilers, the videos are good as well.[0]: Some related content that I enjoyed reading: https://lesleylai.info/en/ast-in-cpp-part-1-variant/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The notes reference:    "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"
    Abdulaziz Ghuloum
    http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf

Can't recommend it enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another text using this approach:https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compila... - Jeremy Siek's Essentials of Compilation (there's also a Python version)Admittedly I didn't finish working through it (life got in the way), but I worked through a good chunk of it with a colleague from a non-CS background. He wanted to understand compilers and it seemed to be much more effective than other texts he'd tried to work through. I'll have to look at this one at some point, probably this summer when things are usually calmer for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593088</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's crazy that this post seems to have stumbled across an equivalent to the Copy-and-Patch technique[0] used to create a Lua interpreter faster than LuaJit[1][0]: https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12/
[1]: https://sillycross.github.io/2022/11/22/2022-11-22/The major difference is that LuaJIT Remake's Copy-and-Patch requires "manually" copying blocks of assembly code and patching values, while this post relies on the Go compiler's closures to create copies of the functions with runtime-known values.I think there's fascinating processing being made in this area—I think in the future this technique (in some form) will be the go-to way to create new interpreted languages, and AST interpreters, switch-based bytecode VMs, and JIT compilation will be things of the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling an expression to a tree of closures, and a list of statements to a slice of closures, is exactly how I optimized [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro)  my Go interpreter written in go.There are more tricks available there, as for example unrolling the loop that calls the list of closures, and having a `nop` closure that is executed when there's nothing to run but execution is not yet at the end of the the unrolled loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiling queries is one of those things that is both Make it Right and Make it Fast.Because bind variables and Prepared Statements go hand in hand, you want to do everything you can to coax your users into doing the right thing. If each unique query has to be compiled before first use, that’s an extra inducement to using prepared statements properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595283</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dumb question, but if register contention deadlock is possible, what would stop the shaders or hardware from, say, detecting the deadlock and spilling one or more threads to local memory?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I would have expected the request for additional registers to be linked into the resource request scoreboarding you see for texture accesses, rt hardware requests, etc.  Busy waiting on condition code seems non optimal, and opening the window for cases where one or all shader programs on core can no longer make progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a really good trick. New to me. Anyone know a reasonable way to do the query equivalent? Not allocate more, ask how many are currently available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595223</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive visualization of the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm, which is used for rendering lines in computer graphics. Users can manipulate parameters to see how the algorithm calculates pixel positions in real-time, demonstrating the step-by-step process of line drawing. This educational tool aims to enhance understanding of the DDA algorithm and its application in graphical applications. Through user interaction, visitors can grasp the concepts of graphics rendering more intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Original author here. I've been reading this website for years. Imagine my shock when I saw my own article on the front page! I'm glad people are enjoying it.Quick fact about the way the interactivity is done, all of the code for it is in this blogpost.js file: https://aaaa.sh/creatures/blogpost.js, which is only about 100 lines long. Each block has a list of scripts that it pulls from like so:&lt;div class="code-example" scripts="grid-sm 2d-vector-gfx-lib draw-grid full-algo-intro feather-canvas-edges"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and then there's a set of script tags with those ids. I figured it was a nice solution!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's incredible timing, I just spent 2 days trying to implement DDA from first principles for my wolfenstein-like game in C.Can't wait to see how you explain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, this is DDA, not Bresenham, for lines.An interesting point about Bresenham's algorithm is made by David Schmenk (dschmenk) on his "Bresen-Span" page:"Take note that the algorithm can be viewed as the long division of delta-major/delta-minor. The error term is really the running remainder, and every step results in a pixel along the major axis until the division completes with a remainder. The division restarts by moving along the minor axis and adding the dividend back in to the running remainder (error term). This is a bit of a simplification, but the concept is that the long division will only result in two integral spans of pixels, depending on the value of the running remainder (error term). We will take this in to account to write a routine that outputs spans based on the two span lengths: a short-span and a long-span."In other code, dschmenk does use DDA for anti-aliased lines.https://github.com/dschmenk/Bresen-Span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43543007</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Loader's number is a large number defined in the context of computability theory and is named after the mathematician John Loader. It is an example of a number that arises in discussions related to the hierarchy of large numbers and sets. The article discusses its properties, background, and significance in mathematical and computational settings. It also explores its relation to other large numbers, its calculation, and the implications of its size in theoretical mathematics. Overall, Loader's number serves as a fascinating example of the complexities involved in large number theory and its relevance to various fields within mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines ten essential rules for successfully negotiating a job offer. Key points include understanding your worth and doing market research to set realistic salary expectations, maintaining a positive and collaborative attitude during negotiations, and being prepared to articulate your unique skills and value to the organization. It emphasizes the importance of considering the entire compensation package, including benefits and work-life balance, rather than focusing solely on salary. Additionally, the author advises on the significance of being patient and willing to walk away if the offer does not meet your needs. Overall, the rules are designed to empower job seekers to advocate effectively for themselves while fostering a constructive dialogue with potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a company I've interviewed with, I've been asked twice a salary range and declined both times. I was even transparent for the 2nd time (which happened months later) and answered that it's not in my interest to give a number first.Well, I received an offer from them and I would have undercut myself by 30%.This is perhaps—or perhaps not—an extreme example, but I only applied what I was told in the negotiation articles and books I've read.When you read a book, you're going to think "It's just fantasy; no way this is going to happen to me" but if you actually apply that knowledge it can truly work in your favor.I also declined an offer 2 months beforehand because the salary was ridiculously low, despite being unemployed at the time.Want is fine, need is not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the sentences at the very start caught my eye:&gt; I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation?There's a wealth of actionable negotiation advice if you know where to look, like Harvard Business Review and Harvard Law, First Round Review, among others.One of the big pieces on negotiation I got from Harvard[0], from their Program on Negotiation. I did not attend Harvard, but reading two or three of their articles a week goes a long way.--[0]: https://www.pon.harvard.edu/uncategorized/what-is-anchoring-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked for resources a few years ago and found a post by a software engineer talking about "Fearless Salary Negotiation" [1]. The engineer said: "it's a small book, cost me around 40 bucks which were immediately compensated by the fact that I managed to negotiate a higher salary".I wanted to ask for a raise: I had been working in that startup for 4 years and had never had a raise. I thought "if that book helps me get a raise of a few bucks per month, that will pay for it".It didn't go as planned: I followed the instructions in the book, my boss spent an hour bullshitting me and I didn't get a raise. So I sent my resignation the next day. The boss called me back, and I got a substantial raise and a bonus (to compensate for the shitty salary I had been having before, it was not a miracle).All that to say that this book did not make me a pro negotiator. But it made me understand how salary negotiation works (reading it, I felt like a child: it only says common sense stuff, but I had been doing everything wrong my whole life). And it gave me the confidence to actually ask for a raise.Totally worth it.[1]: https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596864</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You pretty much need to use markup (or control codes) for rich text. Take bold, italic, underline, strikeout: those four can, and are, used in nearly any combination. You would need one bit for each of them. You would need two bits to specify four levels of headings. If you don't allow for that, you are back to using markup. You would also need one bit to specify proportional/fixed width font, because that is a thing too. That remaining bit would have to be used for superscript, since superscripts are commonly used for footnotes and simple mathematical expressions.Okay, you can now create passable rich text documents for a limited (though common) range of purposes with that 8/24-bit breakdown that was suggested. But you may have noticed the author mentioned subscripts, which wasn't in my list. Well, it turns out that subscript and superscript have a terribly limited range of applications if you are specifying them per character: x^2^2 would be visually identical to x^22, and x^a_b would look different from x_b^a (with both presentations being nonsensical). The use of subscripts and superscripts in any technical applications would be severely limited. You need a much richer markup language to be truly expressive. So there really isn't much of a point in offering subscripts. Superscripts, sure, because they have a few non-technical uses.Yet the reality is that people want a much richer set of formatting options. At a minimum, they want to select fonts and font sizes. Some of the formatting options have semantics. I know I crammed four levels of headings in those eight bits, but that only makes sense in headings. It doesn't make sense to specify it per character. Then there are other common document elements, like tables. You can create decent tables using monospaced fonts, but that is limiting and would produce undesirable results in some cases (try displaying April 5^th sensibly, using a monospace font so that it won't affect the width of the columns). On top of that, you are ditching the concept of styles because that implies some sort of markup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odd thing is, you can do quite some bold/italics/superscript in Unicode nowadays. Because, at least from the ASCII letter range, they have been used in symbolic ways in Mathematics, etc., and have been added to Unicode as symbols rather than bold variants of letters. For example:, !, !ᴴᵉˡˡᵒ, ᵂᵒʳˡᵈ!So, there's almost no bold/italic punctuation. And non-ASCII Unicode letters aren't "supported" this way either. But you can get quite far with "formatted" ASCII letters in Unicode, if you're so inclined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hah, I was about to criticise the text for far too lightly conflating markup and punctuation, just to see the afterword.I actually do think the author has a point, in that must solutions today are inelegant, I also don't think this is a problem which has a real elegant solution. Where to draw the line? Why not encode fonts into the standard too, if we're doing bold? Etc.I'm still mostly in favour of keeping everything markdown (in my own writing), however much it pollutes the "purity" of text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562894</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release and historical significance of the source code for MacPaint, the graphical painting program developed for the original Macintosh in the 1980s. It highlights the innovative features of MacPaint, such as its user-friendly interface and use of pixel-based graphics, which were groundbreaking at the time. The post also emphasizes the importance of preserving and sharing old software code for educational and nostalgic purposes, as well as how the availability of the MacPaint source code offers insight into early software development practices and influences on modern computing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every web server claims to be fast, so I wonder how they define that. As someone who has written their own supposedly fast web server I only want configuration simplicity. Most web servers are unnecessarily far too complicated.In a web server here is what I am looking for:* Fast. That is just a matter of streams and pipes. More on this later. That said the language the web server is written in largely irrelevant to its real world performance so long as it can execute low level streams and pipes.* HTTP and WebSocket support. Ideally a web server will support both on the same port. It’s not challenging because you just have to examine the first incoming payload on the connection.* Security. This does not have to be complicated. Let the server administrator define their own security rules and just execute those rules on incoming connections. For everything that fails just destroy the connection. Don’t send any response.* Proxy/reverse proxy support. This is more simple than it sounds. It’s just a pipe to another local existing stream or piping to a new stream opened to a specified location. If authentication is required it can be the same authentication that sits behind the regular 403 HTTP response. The direction of the proxy is just a matter of who pipes to who.* TLS with and without certificate trust. I HATE certificates with extreme anger, especially for localhost connections. A good web server will account for that anger.* File system support. Reading from the file system for a specific resource by name should be a low level stream via file descriptor piped back to the response. If this specific file system resource is something internally required by the application, like a default homepage it should be read only once and then forever fetched from memory by variable name. Displaying file system resources, like a directory listing, doesn’t have to be slow or primitive or brittle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/errantmind/faf is the fastest Rust static "web server" per the most recent TechEmpower Round 23 (Plaintext); it is purposely barebones (provide content via Rust callback!) The top 3 Composite scores are all Rust web frameworks, also not necessarily intended as general-purpose web servers.https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server wins the SEO (and GitHub star) battle, though apparently it is old enough to have a couple unmaintained dependencies.I use https://github.com/sigoden/dufs as my personal file transfer Swiss Army knife since it natively supports file uploads; I will check out Ferron as a lighter reverse proxy with automatic SSL certs vs. Caddy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really good Caddy replacement. The configuration format Caddy uses sometimes feels oversimplified in that complex configurations are hard to read. My instincts tell me this could scale better without getting more verbose. I'm definitely considering a migration if this project matures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555249</guid></item><item><title>27.

What I'm really wondering is, if branch prediction can be observed from interpreted code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mechanical sympathy" effects are so strong on modern CPUs you feel them even in languages like Python that are far from the metal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't see why you wouldn't expect to find cache-sensitivity in Python, or in some other similarly high-level language.Python sequences are defined as "support[ing] efficient element access using integer indices" [1]. Python lists are sequences and thus must support random access. In practice that means the implementation is a (dynamically resizing) array allocated contiguously. That means spatial locality is relevant.If the list type were defined simply as an iterable collection, with no requirement of constant-time random access, the definition would be abstract enough that an implementation might end up being something else than a contiguous array. But if you define the type so that it supports constant-time random access [2], you pretty much end up with cache-friendly sequential access as well.If you don't define the list type as supporting random access, you also sacrifice asymptotic algorithmic efficiency for lookups by index. Any language that cares about efficiency at all separates collections that support efficient random access from those that don't. (For example, Python has lists and dicts/sets for different access patterns. The Java standard library has separate types for contiguous arrays/lists, hashtable-backed collections and tree-backed collections because the three have different algorithmic efficiencies for different access patterns. In practice it leads to different properties in terms of cache-friendliness as well.)[1] https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence[2] As usual, the Python documentation is a bit vague on the details. It doesn't really say random access has to be constant-time, only that it has to be "efficient". So you might be able to have a non-constant time implementation such as an indexable skiplist while arguing that it's efficient, but you'd have to go out of your way to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555110</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for identifying defective RAM ICs, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing and quality control in the manufacturing process. It outlines various techniques to diagnose faulty memory chips, including functional testing, fault modeling, and the use of specialized diagnostic tools. The author also provides insights into common failure modes and the significance of understanding the underlying causes of defects to improve overall product reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you stress test small address ranges around each failing address, does that selectively heat up the chip to which that address routes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the reason the address-&gt;IC mapping is non-trivial is for performance reasons.If you were, for example, iterating over a column of a 2D array with a stride equal to some power of two, you'd end up hitting the same IC repeatedly. This limits your bandwidth to that of a single IC, rather than balancing it over all of them. (I'm simplifying a little, but that's the gist)So they try to "swizzle" things, using a formula like the one in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not loading for me, but here's the archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20250207044221/https://blog.pier...On 80's arcade games and home computers you can try piggybacking a known working RAM chip onto each of the RAMs for a quick diagnosis, if you're lucky (it doesn't always work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554789</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of configuration complexity in the context of computer systems and how it can affect performance and reliability. It highlights the importance of understanding and managing complexity to ensure systems function effectively. The author uses the analogy of a clock to illustrate how components interact, emphasizing that just like a clock, systems can become overly complicated if not designed thoughtfully. The article also addresses strategies to mitigate complexity, advocating for simplicity and clarity in system design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For python apps (whether we should use python for apps is another question completely) my preferred config language is python.A little config.py file gets imported by everything in the project. It contains nothing but assignments to config variables. No functions. Nothing dragged in from a file. Just variable assignments.It's easy to understand, easy to update, and everyone understands this much python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This ("the rule of least power") is a rule I abide by religiously:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_powerI build lots of DSLs/configuration languages but Im pretty militant about killing them if requirements dictate a need for anything resembling loops or conditionals. Those are the the klaxon warning bells telling you that you should just be writing code/a library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tend to do a lot of data-oriented programming, including at the meta-programming level, which blends with the problem of configuration. A pattern I found that works well this use case and covers the whole clock is the following:- DSL as functions T, args* -&gt; T, where T is your configuration type — or, as I like to call it, a plan. Since under function composition it's insensitive to composition order (associativity of the monoid), you can layer DSL functions on top of each other freely.- Literal values as implicit functions. Once the plan is built and before it is run/compiled/interpreted, I cast any literal value in the datatype to a function returning that value. It's a design principle that allows me to hard-code behavior when a literal value is not enough by just swapping it with a lambda.- Once this kind of homogeneity is ensured, and given the points above, I can extend my DSL and the behavior it describes with point-free function combinators. I get conditionals, advanced composition (parallelism for instance) , instrumentation (debugging), etc... without burdening my DSL with ad-hoc, invasive implementations. More importantly I can reuse these facilities across DSLs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555760</guid></item><item><title>32.

There is some font magic to render {30,60} as small bars in the text.Nice, but the terms were new to me.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the alarming conditions in El Salvador's prisons, highlighting the government's harsh measures against crime, including mass incarcerations under President Nayib Bukele's administration. It warns American visitors about the potential dangers of traveling to El Salvador, particularly in light of Trump's historical comments about the country. The piece critiques the implications of such policies on human rights and emphasizes the broader impact of gang violence and governmental responses on society. The author calls for awareness regarding the harsh realities of life in El Salvador's prison system, contrasting it with perceptions in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heh, even the extrajudicial imprisonment camps can be outsourced now. Why look bad having your military run Guantanamo when you can do the Uber model it for a cheap price.Heh, or is a pun on AirBnB the more apt name for it.. "Concrete Floor &amp; Indefinite Detention"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across this article[1] the other day, after reading about the US sending people to a prison in El Salvador and wondering what we actually know about the place.An incongruity that I didn't notice at the time but realized a bit later is that the prison is called "The Center for Terrorism Confinement" and it has a capacity of 40,000 people.  Why would El Salvador or any country need a terrorist detention facility that holds 40,000 people?According to wikipedia, El Salvador has a population of about 6 million.The United States famously kept people accused of terrorism charges at Guantanamo Bay, and 780 prisoners have been kept there over the last couple decades since GWB established the prison.  There are currently 15.Presumably there are a lot more people who would fit the description "domestic terrorist" being held in jails in mainland US, but certainly not 40,000 of them.Presumably president Bukele's administration is using it as a detention facility for regular criminals as well, but it wouldn't be surprising if there's a lot of people there that shouldn't be in jail in the first place.[1] https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/americas/el-salvador-prison-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point you have a better chance of being freed from this prison camp being a citizen of any other nation than the US which is sending people there without giving them a chance to prove that they are innocent or a citizen of the United States.At least another nation will do whatever they can to get you home unlike the US that just doesn't care. "We made a mistake but we don't care. Nothing we can do." Truly abhorrent especially when the US can do so much to get someone if they really want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588970</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know the craziest thing about watching this as an outsider in Canada is that we as a nation are losing one reliable trading partner (and obviously losing an ally but that's another conversation). Germany - losing a trade partner. Japan? And so on. But the US has lost 180 reliable trading partners. You're already seeing in the first week burgeoning trade alliances between nations who wouldn't have cooperated before, and the amount of resentment against America from this is going to take a generation to heal.Of course I'm sure some people would claim this is 4D chess or what not but.. sometimes the person doing something crazy is just crazy at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was looking at used cars on Carmax about two or three weeks ago. I looked again today. They're another $1-2k.This is the shareholder/political class trying to eat their cake and have it too. Pay people a stagnant wage for 40 years while taking most of the surplus value and dedicating it to equities, then pretend to do something about it, but in a way that passes the buck to the people who have been making a stagnant wage so that the wealthy don't incur actual losses.Share prices will be brought back up through layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not going to comment on the politics, but I'd point out that recession odds on Kalshi are currently 64% and 58% on Polymarket [1,2].  In other words, recession in 2025 is more likely than not -- though far from guaranteed.My thought relevant to HN is that either way this is likely to decimate venture capital and startups, at least in the short run.  Venture capital funds come from limited partners like pensions and endowments, and the professionals I know are all shifting away from growth stocks and into value, international and bonds.  VC is already in a drought (except for AI) and now my guess is that it's going to get worse.  So many VCs I know have started only in the last 15 years, so they have never seen a real recession like 2009 while working in venture.[1] https://kalshi.com/markets/kxrecssnber/recession[2] https://polymarket.com/event/us-recession-in-2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589231</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major carriers are increasingly hostile to SMS that don't originate from one of their customers' handset.Killing off this gateway cuts off an avenue of escape that  people might use to avoid TCR.If you haven't heard of TCR, you should check it out because it is negatively impacting you somewhere.Overseen by TMobile, The Campaign Registry is a pay-to-play scheme that applies to everyone who wants to send SMS to a ATT/TM/Vz user.To onboard with TCR, applicants have to:    1) pay up front and pay more and then pay forever 
    2) jump thru needlessly complicated hoops (that become ever-moving goalposts for small biz and end users).
    3) wait weeks-&gt;months then GOTO 2 again. And again.

The end result is more and more biz, MNVOs, orgs, etc are abandoning SMS. Trying to comply with TCR is too big a resource-sink for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking for a way to programmatically get messages to your phone I recommend Pushover. It's reasonably priced ($5 one time purchase for individuals) and it's run by a solo dev.https://pushover.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, yikes. I’ve come to rely on the email-&gt;sms gateway from AT&amp;T. I’ve had they set up a s a forwarding address within my web mail for a few years now, and have filters which forward matching messages as SMS to my phone.The formatting is often quite lousy but it’s enough to send me a nudge to check my email for a message from the library, a job I applied for, or whatever.I wouldn’t have heard about this about it being posted here, so thank you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589523</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built something similar a few years ago, but using a Pi instead of an Arduino. Reading through the poster's calculations brought back memories of debugging my own orbital mechanics code at 2am while questioning all my life choices.What impresses me most here isn't just the technical achievement, but how the project transforms abstract data into physical movement. We've become so accustomed to viewing everything through screens that there's something deeply satisfying about a physical object that silently points to a spacecraft traveling 28,000 km/h overhead with humans inside.The mathematical transformation from TLE to actual motor positioning is non-trivial - converting between reference frames always seems straightforward on paper until you're debugging at 3am wondering why your arrow is pointing at the ground. I appreciate that they shared actual code rather than glossing over the hard parts.For anyone wanting to build this: from my experience, the hardest part is actually the mechanical design. Getting smooth movement without backlash in consumer-grade steppers and servos takes patience. The 28BYJ-48 is a good budget choice but has noticeable "slop" in its gearing, which can make precise pointing challenging.This reminds me of those old mechanical orreries that modeled the solar system. There's something profoundly human about building machines that help us comprehend the cosmos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering the degree to which an equatorial mount would have simplified the code (made more complex the set-up of the mount).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool! TIL that pencil lead can be a lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593956</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the book discuss capacitive vs resistive touchscreens?At the time you basically had two choices for touchscreens: resistive or capacitive.   Resistive was "obviously" the way to go because it was far more accurate.   Choosing capacitive was inspired -- when used with stubby fingers the accuracy problem was moot, and it allowed multi-touch.Just before the iPhone came out I was fairly confident I knew what the future was.   It was now possible to create a phone with the horsepower to run a real web browsers.  800x600 pixel screens were available which would display normal web pages nicely, and a resistive touch screen with a stylus would make them useful.Then the iPhone came out.  320x480 screen meant normal web pages wouldn't display properly, inaccurate touchscreen meant tap targets needed to be increased massively.    Why would anybody buy an iPhone which didn't allow you to install apps, and the web was unusable because it required rewriting every page since existing pages were unusable.   Instead you could buy a phone which allowed you to install apps and which allowed you to usably access the web.   Obviously the iPhone would be a failure.  :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty similar to the Japanese "flick" keyboard that's fairly commonly used on smartphones. Instead of 3 possible directions per button there's 5 (up, left, right, down, and neutral): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5UEsHEZWIIIt's pretty intuitive because Japanese kana is a syllabary that's organized by their starting consonant and one of five possible vowels in the Gojuon system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABonI never got used to it but people who use it swear by it. Google even made a mechanical version for an April Fools a few years back: https://youtu.be/5LI1PysAlkU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, i always think "i wish there was a demo" of each iterative step on these kind of design journeys. And especially the iOS keyboard, as i thought a lot about it. Awesome that you made this.I really like their idea to make the touch keyboard work well by increasing the (invisible) "padding" area for the key most likely to be typed next. So obvious in hindsight but demos like your's show part of the journey.There are rumors that in the beginning they tried the ipod wheel as the user input interface.While working on my device, that idea is super motivating. I know where i am headed and have done a lot of work and really got something very, very interesting already. But a few parts are yet not clear at all. But, i am definitely further than our "clickwheel" stage. Not yet at the "secret padding" stage for some input ideas, but still.In case you are free and interested to loosely talk about ideas or feedback you have for a very novel device (and interface), please let me know how to reach out. Just because you made this demo, i feel we'd get a long &amp; i can learn a lot from you. And this might be a very interesting challenge for someone like you.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observational bias is interesting.  For example, if you judge by the stars visible to the naked eye, you get a very different sense of the distribution of stellar masses than if you use a telescope, because no class M main sequence stars will be included (the brightest has apparent magnitude 6.7).  The intrinsically brightest stars, including many of the famously named ones, are visible to great distances and so are very overrepresented.The most spectacular form of observational bias could be the presence of life.  The planet we are on will always have life (because, we are here and we are life) regardless of how uncommon life actually is in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43591866</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been following Voyager since the late 70s when my dad (who worked at Ames) would bring home printouts of the Jupiter images. This interview captures something profound about these missions that non-space folks often miss.The most striking part isn't the technical achievement of keeping 1970s hardware alive for half a century. It's the human infrastructure behind it - the institutional knowledge passed through generations of engineers like some ancient priesthood maintaining a temple.Think about it: We're teaching 2020s engineers to understand machine code written before MS-DOS existed, working with 50 year old documentation on yellowing paper, and bringing retirees back to decipher systems they built when Nixon was president.Our space exploration legacy is being maintained by the engineering equivalent of oral history. This is why we need consistent funding for these long-term missions - the value isn't just in the data, but in maintaining the unbroken chain of knowledge transfer that makes missions like this possible.The sticky notes on diagrams trying to revive a silent probe 15 billion miles away just broke me. This is humanity at its finest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time this topic comes up on HN, I always like to remind readers about the following:One of my favorite facts ever is that Voyager 1 contains something called the Voyager Golden Record [1]. It has the following quote written:This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.I get chills every time I think about this.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; silicaFor anyone else curious, it's from the hydrazine tank's rubber diaphragm. Tubes inside the thrusters, which direct fuel to the catalyst beds, had openings taken from 250 um diameter down to 35 um.[1]The 28" spherical tank[2] has a rubber hemisphere to separate hydrazine from pressurant (He? N?). The diaphragm is EDPM that's teflon and silica filled.[3] The silica particles are for (tensile?) strengthening. It has a leaching issue (discussed in [2] page17).PSI was a small SoCal company.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of a "fifth kind of optimization," which goes beyond traditional optimization strategies employed in various fields. It discusses how this new layer involves not just maximizing efficiency or effectiveness, but also encompasses ethical considerations, sustainability, and the impact of decisions on society and the environment. The author emphasizes the importance of integrating these broader values into optimization processes to create solutions that are not only effective but also socially responsible and sustainable for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555311"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every large scale cloud/SaaS software has been using parallelism for decades [well, almost two decades give or take]. Requests run in parallel on millions of servers and one server processes many requests in parallel.In that sort of setup the old school optimize one program by doing things in parallel is somewhat less relevant because everything by its nature is massively parallel and complex operations are often broken down into bits that all run in parallel. In that sort of environment over-parallelizing can actually be a pessimization because there is often some cost around breaking the work up to run in parallel and your little bit of this massively parallel system may have some fraction of resources anyways.Not to say there's no value in knowing "old school" parallelizing (including using SIMD or GPUs or whatnot) but for many types of applications that's not where I'd focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow his taxonomy of optimizations doesn't have a category for things like "unroll a loop", "fuse loops", "block your array accesses", "avoid false sharing", or "strength-reduce your operations".  He has a "use a better algorithm" category, but his example is switching from bubble sort to selection sort, which is a much more disruptive kind of change than such micro-optimizations, which are usually considered to be "the same algorithm".This is rather puzzling, given that he starts off with, "Premature optimisation might be the root of all evil, but", quoting Knuth, and in context, Knuth was primarily talking about precisely such micro-optimizations: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/356635.356640 p. 267 (p. 7/41)Specifically, the optimizations Knuth was exhibiting in that section of the paper are:- speeding up a sequential array search by copying the search key to an empty spot at the end of the array, so that the loop only requires one termination test (are keys equal?) rather than two (are keys equal? is index in bounds?), speeding it up on typical machines of the time by 50%;- unrolling that version of the loop 2× in a way that required gotos, speeding it up by a further 12%.None of the optimization techniques being applied there fit into any of Tratt’s categories!Now, I can't claim to be any sort of optimization expert, but I think these kinds of micro-optimizations are still important, though, as Knuth pointed out at the time, not for all code, and often the drawbacks are not worth it.  Sometimes compilers will save you.  The C compiler might unroll a loop for you, for example.  But often it won't, and it certainly isn't going to pull something like the sentinel trick, because it doesn't know you aren't reading the array in another thread.This sort of depends on what context you're working in; arguably if your hotspots are in Python, even (as Tratt says) in PyPy, you have bigger opportunities for optimization available than manually unrolling a loop to reduce loop termination tests.  But I've found that there's often something available in that sort of grungy tweaking; I've frequently been able to double the speed of Numpy code, for example, by specifying the output array for each Numpy operation, thus reducing the cache footprint.  The code looks like shit afterwards, sadly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s also ‘don’t do it’ ( just turn the whole thing off because it’s actually not needed ) and ‘use a better middleman’ ( os, compiler etc while not going lower level). In my experience these are very cheap and usually not looked at and most devs jump at the other 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555311</guid></item><item><title>43. 404s – gallery of error 404 page designs</title><link>https://www.404s.design/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various database protocols and their importance in ensuring efficient data management and integrity within distributed systems. It outlines different types of protocols, such as two-phase commit and consensus algorithms, explaining how they help in synchronizing transactions across multiple nodes to maintain consistency. The piece emphasizes the trade-offs between performance, reliability, and complexity, providing insights into the selection and implementation of appropriate protocols for specific application needs. Overall, the article serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the fundamental concepts and challenges associated with database protocols in modern applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593547"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title says Database Protocols, but the author writes only about MySQL and Postgres. There are other databases out there, for example Oracle that I’m the most familiar with and it has had a break/reset mechanism built in to its protocol for at least 30 years [1]. Its a 2 step operation (2 roundtrips), one sending an error back to the client instead of the expected result and the second step will reset “current call” (not current session or connection) state on the server side and then request the client do the same.Databases/protocols that differentiate between connection, session and call scopes, can reliably perform resets without requiring to tear down the entire connection.Retrying is safe with no client side transaction idempotency tokens needed, as the error handling will roll back any changes done only by the failed call, not the entire transaction or session.[1]: https://tanelpoder.com/2008/04/10/sqlnet-breakreset-to-clien...Edit: added the comment about retry and idempotency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postgres does have "reset" support.There are several ways commands depending on what you want to reset. If you're only interested in mutable state changeable with SET, you can use RESET ALL instead. This resets configuration settings such as the time zone, statement timeout, and so on.Postgres has different fine-grained ways to reset other aspects of a session, such as closing cursors (CLOSE ALL), unlistening from notifications (UNLISTEN), deallocating prepared plans (DEALLOCATE), and so on. Finally, there's DISCARD ALL, which resets everything.I agree about error handling. Most clients just disconnect on a connection error.One gotcha about Postgres queries is that running queries do not get cancelled when the client disconnects. This has always been a weird one that's quite dangerous, as it can lead to dog-piling — if a client starts a slow query, then times out or cancels its connection, the query lives on; then if another identical request starts, same thing happens, and soon you have 100 queries running that are doing the same thing and getting slower and slower. You have to be very careful with retrying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most these issues seem specific to, and created by, the impedance mismatch between ORMs (like ActiveRecord) and databases.To work correctly, application code must be aware of transactions, and be prepared to roll back state and safely retry a transaction on failure.ORMs like ActiveRecord struggle to do this because they attempt to present a transactional database as a low-friction, in-memory, mutable, non-transactional data model that does not support rollback.If you lose a connection to the database prior to successfully committing your transaction, this is just another form of transaction failure.You need to discard any pending application state changes, open a new connection and transaction, requery data required to determine the actual current state, and then if necessary, retry your transaction.ActiveRecord can’t do that, hence the ill-advised desire to be able to automatically retry statements on failure — which abandons database-mediated transaction isolation, and incorrectly shifts responsibility for database state preservation/management to the client.If SQL was trivially idempotent, we wouldn’t need transactions or different levels of transaction isolation in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593547</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Soul of an Old Machine" explores the emotional and nostalgic connections people have with vintage technology, particularly old computers and devices. It delves into how these machines are often viewed not just as tools, but as carriers of memories and experiences, reflecting the intersection of humanity and technology. The piece also discusses the cultural significance of reviving and maintaining these machines, highlighting the artistry and craftsmanship involved in their design and the stories they tell about past eras.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite anecdote from Soul of a New Machine is about Josh Rosen, who designed the MV8000's arithmetic block.  According to the story, after troubleshooting various timing and layout issues he left a note on his terminal:  "I'm going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite books by my favorite author. Tracy Kidder gets to the heart of everyone he profiles like no other. Strongly recommend his book House if you like Soul of a New Machine.Funny anecdote: I've read Soul of a new machine many times over the years, and love it dearly. I stayed with my aunt and uncle last year and somehow the topic of mini computers came up. I mentioned Soul of a New Machine and my uncle said "oh yeah I worked on that computer." I was blown away. Apparently he had worked at Data General and he was on the software team (which is briefly mentioned towards the end of the book) that wrote the software the Eagle was released with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love books about writing/creating new software/hardware. One I can recommend, about Windows NT is: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Windows-Gene...Does anyone here know about any book(s) on the VAX, or indeed on any of DEC's machines, or IBM's stuff (which were - probably still are - beautifully engineered) come to that? I'm aware of "Big Blue", but that is mostly about IBM business practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555474</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses operational security (opsec) considerations for travelers crossing borders with cell phones. It emphasizes the importance of protecting personal data and mitigating risks of surveillance or data theft. Key recommendations include minimizing sensitive data on devices, using strong passwords, enabling encryption, and being cautious about disclosing information to border authorities. The author highlights that while it’s legal for authorities to inspect devices, travelers should be aware of their rights and take proactive measures to safeguard their information.&lt;/p&gt;

I was recently able to pick it up again. From an inquiry with my lawyer, the following emerged: The authorities tried to read the device with both UFED4PC and Cellebrite Premium Touch. In addition, software from other forensic providers was used without success. The software did not succeed in breaking the system. The device was in BFU mode and had a 30-digit PIN. USB port was deactivated. As of March 2025, I can therefore say that it is not possible for Cellebrite to break a secured GrapheneOS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a modern iPhone and don’t want the crazy hacks, a very very simple but effective tip is to power off your iPhone when exiting the aircraft. When the device powers up it is in “before first unlock” mode and is severely restricted in what it can do. The attack surface area is significantly reduced. They’re not going to burn one of their $100,000 per install exploits on your BFU phone the same way they do with a full physical access unlocked paid exploit.Also lockdown mode to reduce attack surface area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of article makes me sad, as why should we live in a world where we (or at least some people) need to even think about this.. maybe I woke up this morning in a foul mood, but honestly, the idea of even having to think about burner phones and "opsec" for traveling (or even just living) depresses me to the point where I will probably not do it at all, and if things go sour, I just accept my fate. Similar to the prepping advice currently given by the scaremongering news in the EU... (Have water, and an emergency radio!!).Anyone else feel like this? I simply do not have any desire to live in a world where this kind of behavior is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555597</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As LLMs do things thought to be impossible before, LeCun adjusts his statements about LLMs, but at the same time his credibility goes lower and lower. He started saying that LLMs were just predicting words using a probabilistic model, like a better Markov Chain, basically. It was already pretty clear that this was not the case as even GPT3 could do summarization well enough, and there is no probabilistic link between the words of a text and the gist of the content, still he was saying that at the time of GPT3.5 I believe. Then he adjusted this vision when talking with Hinton publicly, saying "I don't deny there is more than just probabilistic thing...". He started saying: not longer just simply probabilistic but they can only regurgitate things they saw in the training set, often explicitly telling people that novel questions could NEVER solved by LLMs, with examples of prompts failing at the time he was saying that and so forth. Now reasoning models can solve problems they never saw, and o3 did huge progresses on ARC, so he adjusted again: for AGI we will need more. And so forth.So at this point it does not matter what you believe about LLMs: in general, to trust LeCun words is not a good idea. Add to this that LeCun is directing an AI lab that as the same point has the following huge issues:1. Weakest ever LLM among the big labs with similar resources (and smaller resources: DeepSeek).2. They say they are focusing on open source models, but the license is among the less open than the available open weight models.3. LLMs and in general all the new AI wave puts CNNs, a field where LeCun worked (but that didn't started himself) a lot more in perspective, and now it's just a chapter in a book that is composed mostly of other techniques.Btw, other researchers that were in the LeCun side, changed side recently, saying that now "is different" because of CoT, that is the symbolic reasoning they were blabling before. But CoT is stil regressive next token without any architectural change, so, no, they were wrong, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent talk:

Two declare it a crisis that requires acting without congress and circumventing existing laws. Three destroy something that will take generations to repair, if it can be repaired. Four repeat with something else so quickly that people forget the last few things destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Emergency” my ass. More like made up crap to bully Canada by orange buffoon who hates trees as much as windmills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This executive action blames forest management for increased wildfires, but the IPCC has predicted this exact problem for decades.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit of context regarding Project Gutenberg. Its intake process is far from casual. Take a look at Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders (PGDP, [0],[1]), one of the oldest "crowd-sourcing" projects on the net (est. 2000). As you can see from [0], every book goes through three rounds of proofing, where volunteers read each page of text and compare it to the scanned image; then through two rounds of format review, where other volunteers insert or review format markup.From that 5-pass process the marked-up text is handed to a volunteer "post-processor" who assembles the final HTML or e-book file; then the completed book gets one more "smooth reading" pass before it is posted to PG.This it the process that produces the books input to Standard Ebooks. That they can still find scanner errors ("tne" for "the", a typical "scanno") demonstrates how difficult it is to see those. But their presence isn't from carelessness or disregard for the value of the books.In the 20-teens I put in hundreds of volunteer hours at PGDP in all the above roles, and it was very satisfying work. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an online hobby that feels constructive. Volunteering time to Standard Ebooks would probably feel good as well.[0] https://www.pgdp.net/c/activity_hub.php[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Proofreaders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editor-in-chief here, happy to answer any questions, as always.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution and architectural design of the XNU kernel, which underlies Apple's Darwin operating system. It explores the historical context of its development, highlighting the integration of components from both FreeBSD and the Mach microkernel. The piece delves into key features of the XNU architecture, such as its hybrid kernel design, memory management, and support for various hardware platforms. It also examines the performance implications and benefits of this architecture in terms of efficiency and security, showcasing its significance within the broader landscape of operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What impresses me most about technical documentation like this is how it structures knowledge into comprehensible layers. This article manages to explain an extremely complex system by establishing clear relationships between components.I've been experimenting with similar approaches for documentation in open source projects, using knowledge graphs to link concepts and architectural decisions. The biggest challenge is always keeping documentation synchronized with evolving code.Has anyone found effective tools for maintaining this synchronization between documented architecture and implemented code? Large projects like Darwin must have established processes for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Mach’s virtual memory (VM) system was influential beyond the project – it was adopted by 4.4BSD and later FreeBSD as their memory management subsystem.…and NetBSD[0], OpenBSD[1], but apparently not DragonFly BSD[2].[0] https://netbsd.org/docs/kernel/uvm.html[1] https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.0/uvm.9[2] https://www.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2011-04/msg0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article states that "pager daemons" that manage swap files runs in user space, and the kernel memory can also get swapped out, but never explained how a user space daemon swaps out kernel memory. Do they have hard-coded exceptions for special daemons, or use special system calls? Where can I find out more details about the user space memory management specifically?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597778</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of security within the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) certification, emphasizing that security should be a core focus for IT professionals. It outlines the increasing demand for cybersecurity skills in the job market and argues that security knowledge is essential for maintaining system integrity and protecting sensitive data. The author advocates for more comprehensive training in security within the MCP framework to equip professionals with the necessary skills to address contemporary cybersecurity challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post highlights and cites a few attack scenarios we originally described in a security note (tool poisoning, shadowing, MCP rug pull), published a few days ago [1]. I am the author of said blog post at Invariant Labs.Different from what many suspect, the security problem with MCP-style LLM tool calling is not in isolating different MCP server implementations. MCP server implementations that run locally should be vetted by the package manager you use to install them (remote MCP servers are actually harder to verify).Instead, the problem here is a special form of indirect prompt injection that you run into, when you use MCP in an agent system. Since the agent includes all installed MCP server specifications in the same context, one MCP server (that may be untrusted), can easily override and manipulate the agent's behavior with respect to another MCP server (e.g. one with access to your sensitive database). This is what we termed tool shadowing.Further, MCP's dynamic nature makes it possible for an MCP server to change its provided tool set at any point or for any specific user only. This means MCP servers can turn malicious at any point in time. Current MCP clients like Claude and Cursor, will not notify you about this change, which leaves agents and users vulnerable.For anyone, more interested, please have a look at our more detailed blog post at [1]. We have been working on agent security for a while now (both in research and now at Invariant).We have also released some code snippets for everyone to play with, including a tool poisoning attack on the popular WhatsApp MCP server [2].[1] https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool...[2] https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-injection-experiment...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These attacks are mostly just more examples of being on the wrong side of the airlock (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060508-22/?p=31...). None of these involve crossing a privilege boundary, they just found a weird way to do something they could already doAn MCP server is running code at user-level, it doesn't need to trick an AI into reading SSH keys, it can just....read the keys! The rest of these are the same complaints you can levy against basically any other developer tool / ecosystem like NPM or VS Code Extensions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a challenge: sketch a better design, that:1. Is properly secure, to whatever standards will stop people writing "S Stands for Security" articles, and2. Allows programs implementing it to provide the same set of features the most useful MCPs do now, without turning automatic functionality into one requiring manual user confirmations, and generally without defeating the purpose of the entire idea, and3. Doesn't involve locking everything down in a proprietary Marketplace with a corporate Gatekeeper.I'd be interested to see a proposal, because so far all I've seen is "MCP is not sekhure!!!111" in general and non-specific sense. I guess it's not that easy, especially when people forget that security and usefulness are opposing forces.(Also, AFAIK, MCP was not intended for its implementations to be hosted by third parties and provided "as a Service". If that cannot be secure, then don't do it. Find some other business to be in, instead of trying to nerf MCP through "solving" something that isn't a problem with the protocol.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600192</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of the order of configuration directives in OpenSSH's sshd_config file. It emphasizes that the sequence in which options are defined can significantly affect the behavior of the SSH server. The author provides examples to illustrate how certain settings can override others based on their placement, and highlights best practices for organizing configurations to avoid unexpected results. Ultimately, the piece serves as a guide for system administrators to improve their SSH setups by understanding and applying the correct order of configuration directives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purpose of first-define is the rule: In placing configuration files higher than user-defined configuration but Only with SSH client, can want user to have control from their config files: Remove from config files Place a couple under Match/MatchGroup using deny/accept.SSHD (server/non-client) still support admin-defined by having system-wide settings done firstly.

Among the consequences to not checking are gaping security holes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why I erase sshd_config and put what I really meant there. You may say "but isn't it better to patch it properly?". It is not. Yet another vps hoster –&gt; yet another /etc/ssh directory template that may have all sorts of access issues in it. Better to replace it and make it do exactly what you have planned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573507</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this part interesting:&gt; González Waite said that all of the large proprietary software companies ""are big bullies"". He has been called into the US embassy and been threatened because Mexico was using technology that was not from the US; those threats were dialed back when he explained that the government also used software and services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Various companies use the US government to bully other countries, but they also use license audits as a reaction to projects that move to open-source software. Every time a successful switch happened, ""six months later there was an audit""; having the right legal team helps defend against those tactics, he said.It matches also what I heard from someone working for the Dutch government. He said that whenever they needed a new software system, that Microsoft would send multiple consultants for "free" which all could "help" the transition to a new service from Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic network theory:"Economists who have studied the software industry concluded that the value of a software business is about equal to the total costs of its customers switching out to the competition; both are equal to the net present value of future payments from the customers to the software vendor. This means that an incumbent in a maturing market, such as Microsoft with its Office product, can grow faster than the market only if it can find ways to lock in its customers more tightly. There are some ifs and buts that hedge this theory around, but the basic idea is well known to software industry executives. This explains Bill G's comment that `We came at this thinking about music, but then we realized that e-mail and documents were far more interesting domains'."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article uses the phrase "no brainer" but then explains why it very much requires brainer when making IT decisions.License costs are a factor, yes, but they are not the only cost, and in most cases not the significant one.In some cases the offerings are similar enough that it moves the needle. PostgreSQL for example is a good candidate- Oracle is expensive, and the number of people interacting with it is limited. Plus the fundamentals of Oracle and PostgreSQL are more-or-less the same.On the other extreme the cost of training and support dwarfs the license cost. If all staff come with knowing how to use say Windows and Excel,but require training and support for say Linux Desktop and Libre Office, then the "free" thing costs more.It's no accident that OSS has done better on the backend than the front end.Success for OSS means putting the right product in the right place, taking all things (not just license cost) into account.(Aside: corruption is a red herring, corrupt officials and companies can be corrupt regardless of software license.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43579104</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is where remote work goes off the rails, but then it’s wild how intentionally isolating the implementation of RTO that many large corporations are doing now.They line people up in rows, put headphones on their heads and wire them up to Teams and Jira to spend the whole day in isolation. Because taking a walk to another floor of building to talk to someone like a normal human being is too wasteful, but somehow forcing everyone to spend hours commuting isn’t.It’s the worst of both worlds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An online application of this principle is Focusmate, where you schedule calls with essentially random strangers and just work together. There's very little chit chat and it's not some weird front for a hookup scheme. I've been amazed at how well it works for me. I can't really explain why, after all the other person can't see my screen so I could just be doom scrolling YouTube the whole time, but for some reason I don't. I don't use it all the time, but when I need to get something unappealing done I still use it. I've also used it for exercise, and I've had partners use it for all sorts of weird things that they had been procrastinating. I highly recommend it, I thought it would be far weirder than it turned out to be, and it's really useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I may have ADHD, I never went for a diagnosis and found body doubling useful at times, especially when I was in school some decades ago, back then I had no name for it. However, I find white noise very helpful with staying on the task and with increased focus. My company moved, about a year ago, into a very cramped office that is also extremely noisy.  This exasperated me, I would get drained of energy in a couple of hours and my focus was being severy affected. I even considered quitting and looking for something else. As a last resort I started listening to white noise. I’ve been using white noise (white+brown+pink) for about a year now and find that it helps not only with cancelling out the noise but with focus and staying on task in general. I even use it at home at times. I know this may not be useful for everybody but I’m sure it could help out some of you. I use https://noises.online/ and mix all the types of white noise at the same time for maximim coverage but any type of white noise generator would do. To me it feels like being close to a waterfall. At first my ears hurt a bit after a few hours of white noise but got used to it after a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597425</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage presents research on SeedLM, a machine learning model designed for compressing language models while maintaining their performance. It outlines the challenges associated with current large language models and how SeedLM addresses these issues through efficient parameterization and training methodologies. The research aims to enhance the deployment of language models in resource-constrained environments, making them more accessible and practical for various applications. Additionally, it discusses the technical details of the model's architecture and the implications for future advancements in machine learning and natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting trick, using a dictionary of basis vectors which are quickly computed from a seed without storage. But the result is the same 3 or 4 bit quantization, with only a slight improvement. Their tiles are small, just 8 or 12 weights, it's why compression doesn't go too far. It would have been great if this trick lowered quantization &lt;1 bit/weight, that would require longer tiles. Wondering what are the limits if we use a larger reservoir of cheap entropy as part of neural net architecture, even in training.Congrats to Apple and Meta, makes sense they did the research, this will go towards efficient serving of LLMs on phones. And it's very easy to implement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sounds like they basically find part of a pseudo-random sequence that is closest to the desired data, then store the random seed and corrections (which are small so take less space).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be better to just link directly to the paper [1].

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of blacksmithing and the programming language Lisp, highlighting the similarities in craftsmanship, creativity, and problem-solving required in both fields. It explores how blacksmiths, like programmers, must understand their materials and tools to create effective and elegant designs. The author reflects on the learning process and the importance of practice and experimentation in mastering both disciplines, drawing parallels between forging metal and coding. Ultimately, it emphasizes the art and science behind both blacksmithing and programming, celebrating the craftsmanship involved in each.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the author was talking about Lisp here, the approach should be applied to any language. Split the problem up into an abstraction that makes it look easy. Then dive in and make that abstraction, and ask yourself again what you’d need to make this level easy, and repeat.Sometimes it takes a lot of work to make some of those parts look and be easy.In the end, the whole thing looks easy, and your reward is someone auditing the code and saying that you work on a code base of moderate complexity and they’re not sure if you’re capable enough to do anything that isn’t simple.  But that’s the way it is sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The classic issue of who made the first tongs could be inserted here, with some hammering.(It's a classic legend. There is an Islamic legend that Allah gave the first pair of tongs to the first blacksmith because you need a pair of tongs to make a pair of tongs. There's a Nordic legend that Thor made the first tongs. In reality, somebody probably used a bent piece of green wood, which didn't last long, but could be easily replaced.)His piece "Vibe Coding, Final Word"[1] is relevant right now.[1] https://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/vibe-coding-final-word....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The truth is that when you tap softened tongs around a workpiece into shape, they turn into parentheses. That's what reminds you of Lisp, not the malleability explanation that you invented afterward.Lisp, Jazz, Aikido and (now) Blacksmithing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43566651</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing possibility that neutron stars, which are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars, may provide insights into the existence of an additional dimension beyond the familiar three. Researchers believe that the unique properties of neutron stars, especially their gravitational fields and behavior of matter under extreme conditions, could hint at the existence of hidden dimensions predicted by certain theories in physics, such as string theory. By studying the interactions and characteristics of these stars, scientists aim to deepen their understanding of fundamental forces and the fabric of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Gravity, the thinking goes, can escape our brane and extend into the bulk. That explains why it’s so weak. All the other forces must play in only three spatial dimensions, while gravity can extend itself out to four, spreading itself much too thin in the process.Wouldn't this cause gravitational force to fall off with distance using something other than an inverse-square law? I think this explanation would be a better fit for the weak force than gravity for this reason. Thoughts?More broadly: inverse-square behavior (Gravity, EM etc) strikes me as an intrinsic property of 3D geometry; more so of a tell of dimensionality than the magnitude of the force. (I believe the article is inferring higher dimensionality from relative magnitude, vice distance falloff)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants a super approachable lecture on Neutron stars, this was released just a couple of weeks ago - https://youtu.be/I12SQ7YOebY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Far from expert in the field, but assuming that gravity is acts in a 3+ND and we observe it in our 3D world, shouldn't we observe weird peculiarities with it rather that just its amplitude?Think that you live on a line, and you see projections of a 2d object doing circles on top of you. You would see the shade moving and changing sizes in a non-explainable manner to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600704</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of DuckDB and Apache Arrow to enhance web-based data analytics using WebAssembly (WASM). It explains how the author, motivated by the limitations of traditional data browsers, implemented a real-time data processing solution that leverages the efficiency of DuckDB for querying, along with Arrow's in-memory data format for fast data exchange. The use of web workers enables parallel processing, optimizing performance for web applications dealing with large datasets. The piece highlights the benefits of this approach in terms of speed, ease of implementation, and the potential for building more interactive and responsive data analysis tools in modern web environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tip for all the blog authors, do NOT post code as image. Specially do not add fake editor UI and drop shadow to the image.In this case 25 lines of code is 50 kB of image binary.Also it cannot be searched via search engine. Nor can it be read with screen reader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use the WASM build of DuckDB quite extensively at Count (https://count.co - 2-3m queries per month). There are a couple of bugs we've noticed, but given that it's pretty much maintained by a single person seems impressively reliable!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [wasm] is executed in a stack-based virtual machine rather than as a native library code.Wasm's binary format is indeed a stack-based virtual machine, but that is not how it is executed. Optimizing VMs convert it to SSA form, basic blocks, and finally machine code, much the same as clang or gcc compile native library code.It is true that wasm has some overhead, but that is due to portability and sandboxing, not the stack-based binary format.&gt; On top of the above, memory available to WASM is limited by the browser (in case of Chrome, the limit is currently set at 4GB per tab).wasm64 solves this, by allowing 64-bit pointers and a lot more than 4GB of memory.The feature is already supported in Chrome and Firefox, but not everywhere else yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599613</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for serving vector tiles efficiently, focusing on performance optimization techniques. It highlights the importance of reducing server response times and enhancing data delivery speed for better user experience in web mapping applications. Key methods include the use of caching, optimizing tile size and format, and leveraging technologies like vector tile servers and CDNs. The author provides practical recommendations and tools for developers to implement these strategies to ensure fast and reliable access to vector tiles in geospatial projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The term "serving" is a bit misleading here. Most of the time, vector tile servers are serving pre generated tiles, which is extremely fast. This analysis is about generating tiles on the fly from PostGIS through a custom web server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built a server for generating OpenStreetMap vector tiles on demand from a GeoDesk database, which is barely larger than an .osm.pbf (100GB vs. 80GB for current planet.osm.pbf) - much smaller than a PostGIS instance: https://github.com/styluslabs/geodesk-tiles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;another option that would have been interesting to see here is serving PostGIS GeoJSON export -&gt; tippecanoe encode. Tippecanoe is super fast, parallelizes well and built solely for generating vector tile data (with lots of configurable options that PostGIS lacks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43598600</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest story in AI was released a few weeks ago but was given little attention: on the recent USAMO, SOTA models scored on average 5% (IIRC, it was some abysmal number). This is despite them supposedly having gotten 50%, 60% etc performance on IMO questions. This massively suggests AI models simply remember the past results, instead of actually solving these questions. I'm incredibly surprised no one mentions this, but it's ridiculous that these companies never tell us what (if any) efforts have been made to remove test data (IMO, ICPC, etc) from train data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The core point in this article is that the LLM wants to report _something_, and so it tends to exaggerate. It’s not very good at saying “no” or not as good as a programmer would hope.When you ask it a question, it tends to say yes.So while the LLM arms race is incrementally increasing benchmark scores, those improvements are illusory.The real challenge is that the LLM’s fundamentally want to seem agreeable, and that’s not improving. So even if the model gets an extra 5/100 math problems right, it feels about the same in a series of prompts which are more complicated than just a ChatGPT scenario.I would say the industry knows it’s missing a tool but doesn’t know what that tool is yet. Truly agentic performance is getting better (Cursor is amazing!) but it’s still evolving.I totally agree that the core benchmarks that matter should be ones which evaluate a model in agentic scenario, not just on the basis of individual responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bit of a meta-comment, but reading through the responses to a post like this is really interesting because it demonstrates how our collective response to this stuff is (a) wildly divergent and (b) entirely anecdote-driven.I have my own opinions, but I can't really say that they're not also based on anecdotes and personal decision-making heuristics.But some of us are going to end up right and some of us are going to end up wrong and I'm really curious what features signal an ability to make "better choices" w/r/t AI, even if we don't know (or can't prove) what "better" is yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603453</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transition from the traditional `rsync` utility to `openrsync` in macOS Sequoia, highlighting the reasons for this change, such as improved performance and enhanced security. It explains the key differences between `rsync` and `openrsync`, including how `openrsync` streamlines certain features and offers better handling of file transfer processes. Additionally, the author provides insights on how to adapt to this new utility, including command usage and potential issues users may encounter during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the sparse documentation of openrsync does not create any confidence for me that it can be an acceptable substitute for rsync.In my opinion, any program that is supposed to copy files, but which is not able to make perfect copies, i.e. copies that do not lose any bit of data or metadata that was present in the original file, is just unusable garbage.Unfortunately, most copying programs available in UNIX-like operating systems (and also many archiving programs) do not make perfect file copies with their default options and many of them are never able to make perfect copies, regardless what options are used.I have not looked recently at the scp command of ssh, but at least until a few years ago it was not possible to make perfect file copies with scp, especially when the copies were done between different operating systems and file systems. That is why I never use scp, but only rsync over ssh.Rsync is the only program that I have seen, which is able (with the right options) to make perfect file copies even between different operating systems and file systems (for instance between FreeBSD with UFS and Linux with XFS), preserving also metadata like extended file attributes, access control lists and high-precision file timestamps (some copying programs and archiving programs truncate high-precision timestamps).The current documentation of openrsync does not make any guarantee that it can make complete file copies, so by default I assume that it cannot, so for now it is a program that I consider useless.Beside rsync for copying, one of the few Linux archiving programs that can archive perfect file copies is bsdtar (when using the pax file format; the ancient tar and cpio file formats cannot store all modern file metadata).(FYI: I always alias rsync to '/usr/bin/rsync --archive --xattrs --acls --hard-links --progress --rsh="ssh -p XXX -l YYYYYYY"')(With the right CLI options, "cp" from coreutils can make perfect file copies, but only if it has been compiled with appropriate options; some Linux distributions compile coreutils with wrong options, e.g. without extended file attributes support, in which case "cp" makes only partial file copies, without giving any warnings or errors.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a relatively new Linux user, I often find the "versioning" of bundled system utilities also to be a bit of a mess, for lack of a better word.A classic example, at least from my experience, is `unzip`. On two of my servers (one running Debian and the other an older Ubuntu), neither of their bundled `unzip` versions can handle AES-256 encrypted ZIP files. But apparently, according to some Stack Overflow posts, some distributions have updated theirs to support it.So here is what I ran into:1. I couldn't easily find an "updated" version of `unzip`, even though I assume it exists and is open source.2. To make things more confusing, they all claim to be "version 6.00", even though they obviously behave differently.3. Even if I did find the right version, I'm not sure if replacing the system-bundled one is safe or a good idea.So the end result is that some developer out there (probably volunteering their time) added a great feature to a widely used utility, and yet I still can’t use it. So in a sense, being a core system utility makes `unzip` harder to update than if it were just a third-party tool.I get that it's probably just as bad if not worse on Windows or macOS when it comes to system utilities. But I honestly expected Linux to handle this kind of thing better.(Please feel free to correct me if I’ve misunderstood anything or if there’s a better way to approach this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On one hand, it's a little annoying that openrsync doesn't support some features that rsync does.On the other hand, it's great that there are multiple independent implementations of rsync now. It means that it's actually being treated as a protocol, not just a piece of software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605003</guid></item><item><title>15.

It’s absurd that folks making policy, who have a potentially closer ear to the ground are not more restricted.The 30 days self reporting disclosure period is a joke too. It’s after the fact, has no real penalty for being late and AFAIK they don’t maintain any real restriction lists so it has no impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit uneducated in the ways of shorting options. Is this topical because Mr. President induced a massive stock market meltdown in the US and his friends could have made a fortune for knowing the details and shorted the most likely biggest loss-makers?Or is that not how the markets work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like the post title got the wrong “capital”, the name is Capitol (ie, the Capitol Building, where congresspeople work)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43604052</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The "model-signing" project on PyPI provides a Python package that facilitates the signing and verification of machine learning models to ensure their authenticity and integrity. It aims to enhance the security of deployed models by allowing developers to create secure signatures that confirm a model's source and have not been tampered with. The package is designed to be easy to use, enabling seamless integration into existing model deployment workflows and promoting trust in machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a solution looking for a problem. Can't you just share your model's hash when releasing it? This is exactly what happens when someone like Mistral share a magnet link to their model. It's just a hash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This lets you verify the signature on the model. It won’t help you tell that a decision came from that model. If you want to verify the inference that a model makes, check out https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl (our project).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source: I have a relationship with OpenSSF but not directly involved. I'm involved in a "competing" standard.As other commenters pointed out this is "just" a signature. However, in the absence of standardised checks, this is a useful intermediate way of addressing the integrity issue around ML supply chain; FWIW today.Eventually, you want to move to more complete solutions that have more elaborate checks, e.g. provenance of data that went into the model, attested training. C2PA is trying to cover it.Inference time attestation (which some other commenters are pointing out) -- how can I verify that the response Y actually came from model F, on my data X, Y=F(X) -- is a strongly related but orthogonal problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious: does this fundamentally need to contain an actual model, or would it be okay if it generated a synthetic model itself, full of random weights? I’m picturing downloading just, say, a 20MB file instead of the multi-gigabyte one, and…Hang on, why is https://blob.localscore.ai/localscore-0.9.2 380MB? I remember llamafile being only a few megabytes. From https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases, looks like it steadily grew from adding support for GPUs on more platforms, up to 28.5MiB¹ in 0.8.12, and then rocketed up to 230MiB in 0.8.13:&gt; The llamafile executable size is increased from 30mb to 200mb by this release. This is caused by https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/7156. We're already employing some workarounds to minimize the impact of upstream development contributions on binary size, and we're aiming to find more in the near future.Ah, of course, CUDA. Honestly I might be more surprised that it’s only this big. That monstrosity will happily consume a dozen gigabytes of disk space.llamafile-0.9.0 was still 231MiB, then llamafile-0.9.1 was 391MiB, now llamafile-0.9.2 is 293MiB. Fluctuating all over the place, but growing a lot. And localscore-0.9.2 is 363MiB. Why 70MiB extra on top of llamafile-0.9.2? I’m curious, but not curious enough to investigate concretely.Well, this became a grumble about bloat, but I’d still like to know whether it would be feasible to ship a smaller localscore that would synthesise a suitable model, according to the size required, at runtime.—⁂—¹ Eww, GitHub is using the “MB” suffix for its file sizes, but they’re actually mebibytes (2²⁰ bytes, 1048576 bytes, MiB). I thought we’d basically settled on returning the M/mega- prefix to SI with its traditional 10⁶ definition, at least for file sizes, ten or fifteen years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been waiting for something like this. Have you considered the following based on the benchmark data that's submitted beyond the GPU?1. User selects a model, size and token output speed and latency. The website generates a hardware list of components that should match the performance requirements.2. User selects hardware components and the website generates a list of models that performant on that hardware.3. Monetize through affiliate links the components to fund the project. Think like PC part picker.I know there's going to be some variability in the benchmarks due to the software stack, but it should give a AI enthusiasts, an educated perspective on what hardware can be relevant for their use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributed scores for the M3 Ultra 512 GB unified memory: https://www.localscore.ai/accelerator/404Happy to test larger models that utilize the memory capacity if helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572134</guid></item><item><title>18.

In fact, over the last couple years, I've come to take vulnerabilities with very high CVSS scores less seriously. Remember, Heartbleed was a "7.5".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's so dumb to assign it a CVSS score of 10.Unless you are blindly accepting parquet formatted files this really doesn't seem that bad.A vulnerability in parsing images, xml, json, html, css would be way more detrimental.I can't think of many services that accept parquet files directly. And of those usually you are calling it directly via a backend service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe the headline should note that this a parser vulnerability, not the format itself. I suppose that is obvious, but my first knee-jerk thought was, "Am I going to have to re-encode XXX piles of data?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603091</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting sleep is an exercise wrapped in pain.Figuring out which program prevents sleeping is the easy part - there are tools that show that, and you can also usually just brute force it by killing programs one by one.Then comes figuring out why a system claims to be sleeping but isn't (e.g. the fan is still spinning). Usually this is because of the Modern Standby/S0 crap and in many cases there isn't a solution because the BIOS removed support for S3.The other class of issue is after sleeping the system won't wake up, or wake up randomly, or wake up with random glitchy graphics/sounds/etc.Sleep is easily Windows's most bug-ridden area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to say that I absolutely love these articles. Reading these kinds of investigations is like brain candy to me. I don't know why, but in my head, this falls into the same genre as a Sherlock Holmes novel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it's not a user-space, but a driver issue, I found powercfg /sleepstudy pretty helpful to determine why a W11 machine didn't enter or exited sleep too often, after the fact.On my laptop, this led me to discover that my Qualcomm X55 WAN is a real standby drain and that my Lenovo Thunderbolt dock really likes to disable its sleep mode after some big Windows updates, leading to a standby drain after the first time I plugged it in. I'm still surprised how many pitfalls there are with standby, even on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555365</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential pitfalls of using the Rust programming language, particularly its focus on safety and memory management. It highlights common misconceptions about Rust's safety guarantees, such as the belief that Rust completely eliminates all bugs or that developers can avoid the complexity that comes with its borrowing system. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these limitations to avoid becoming overly reliant on Rust's safety features. By acknowledging these challenges, developers can better navigate the language's complexities and write more effective code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is slightly misleading but the content is good. It's the "Safe Rust" in the title that's weird to me. These apply to Rust altogether, you don't avoid them by writing unsafe Rust code. They also aren't unique to Rust.A less baity title might be "Rust pitfalls: Runtime correctness beyond memory safety."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For integer overflows and array out of bounds I'm quite optimistic about Fluxhttps://github.com/flux-rs/fluxI haven't actually used it but I do have experience of refinement types / liquid types (don't ask me about the nomenclature) and IMO they occupy a very nice space just before you get to "proper" formal verification and having to deal with loop invariants and all of that complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it strange that the article doesn't talk about the alternative to checked arithmetic: explicit Wrapping [0] and Saturating [1] types, also provided as methods on numeric types (e.g. `usize::MAX.saturating_add(1)`).Regarding `as` casting, I completely agree. I am trying to use safe `From::from` instead. However, this is a bit noisy: `usize::from(n)` vs `n as usize`.[0] https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Wrapping.html [1] https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Saturating.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585742</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "mem-isolate" by Brannon Dorsey provides a tool that allows users to isolate processes in memory in order to improve security and enhance application stability. It outlines the installation instructions, usage guidelines, and the methodology behind memory isolation, emphasizing its benefits for mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring safer system operations. The project is open-source, welcoming contributions and collaboration from developers interested in enhancing security features within software applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this meets the definition of "safe" in "safe" Rust: "safe" doesn't just mean "won't crash due to spatial memory errors," it means that the code is in fact spatially and temporally memory safe.In other words: this won't detect memory unsafety that doesn't result in an abnormal exit or other detectable fault. If I'm writing an exploit, my entire goal is to perform memory corruption without causing a fault; that's why Rust's safety property is much stronger than crash-freeness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a way to sandbox native code without forking to a new process, and it looks like thishttps://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-weba...Firefox employs processes for sandboxing but for small components they are not worth the overhead. For those they employed this curious idea: first compile the potentially unsafe code to wasm (any other VM would work), then compile the wasm code to C (using the wasm2c tool). Then use this new C source normally in your program.All UB in the original code becomes logical bugs in the wasm, that can output incorrect values but not corrupt memory or do things that UB can do. Firefox does this to encapsulate C code, but it can be done with Rust too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't mentioned anywhere on the page, but fork is generally not a great API for these kinds of things. In a multi-threaded application, any code between the fork and exec syscalls should be async-signal-safe. Since the memory is replicated in full at the time of the call, the current state of mutexes is also replicated and if some thread was holding them at the time, there is a risk of a deadlock. A simple print! or anything that allocates memory can lead to a freeze. There's also an issue of user-space buffers, again printing something may write to a user-space buffer that, if not flushed, will be lost after the callback completes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601301</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new method for charging electric vehicles five times faster in subfreezing temperatures, addressing a major challenge in EV performance during cold weather. The team utilized a unique thermal management approach that prevents battery degradation while enhancing charging efficiency. This innovation has significant implications for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, particularly in regions with harsh winter climates, and could improve user experience by reducing charging times substantially in such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Things that have a small solar panel, a battery, and no grid connection could benefit from this. Even flashlights could use this.[1] http://arborbatteries.us/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big news on EV charging is from BYD in late March when they announced (and it caused TSLA to fall by a few percent) that their new line of superchargers will be able to charge cars to give them a range of 400 km in just a few minutes.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the brief tenure of Thomas Rattigan as CEO of Commodore International, highlighting his challenges and decisions during his leadership period in the early 1990s. Rattigan's time at Commodore was marked by significant strategic missteps and a failure to adapt to the rapidly changing personal computer market, ultimately contributing to the company's decline. The piece examines his background, the context of his appointment, and the controversies surrounding his management style and decision-making processes that led to his departure and the company's eventual bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

[The other Catholic school only had PET systems at the time.]I learned how to type there, and the rest was history. I owned a VIC20 already, and Dad purchased peripherals such as the 1541 and the 1701.It wasn’t until 3-4 years ago when I began to study history, Irish history in particular, and recognized that the model numbers weren’t chosen arbitrarily or accidentally, but indeed they correlated perfectly to the most ignominious dates in the history of the UK, when anti-Catholic laws were passed and the Irish were stomped into submission.It makes weird sense in retrospect. I mean, nobody ever taught Irish history in school because we are Americans now, and the whole Reformation thing is water under the bridge. And the superior general has a distinctly posh RP accent.Much like the “bitten apple” and its rainbow colors and the $666 price tag, these signs and symbols were hidden in plain sight, as harbingers and warning signs of future troubles. We were all working for the construction crew on a modern Tower of Babel. Literally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Being good at their job can be your downfall in the corp world!

It details the findings from tests conducted on the substance, revealing significant levels of harmful chemicals that pose environmental and health risks.

It happens. It’s not something we do.”I don’t get why they are acting like they have something to hide. Phosphate is mined from rock, rock contains all sorts of other elements including heavy metals. That’s simply how minerals work. It’s not by itself an indication that anyone has done anything wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like one of those things where context changes over time and takes a product outside of it's original use case.Fire retardant is an emergency measure, one that would rightly be expected to see exceptionally low usage overall. But over time, more people and property have gotten closer to the forest; forest fires affect more people for many reasons.So fire retardant use is not so rare.The Therac-20 was a fine piece of electro-mechanical-nuclear technology, but the Therac-25 moved the control scheme out of its original context, and took away some of the physical interlocks. The Therac-25 is not remembered fondly.Context changes over time, and assumptions need to be re-examined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "Phos-Chek MVP-Fx is primarily made of ammonium phosphates, which are derived from phosphate. That rock, when mined, can contain trace amounts of heavy metals."The thing they're catastrophizing about is rock phosphate—ordinary fertilizer that's mixed into the soil of every food farm in the world.I'm not sure if the journalists who wrote this article are aware of this. "It's COVERING my garden plants!" reads quite definitely when you recognize it's f'ing Miracle-Gro.https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-c...- "Phosphorus is an essential element for plant and animal nutrition.

The brightest scientists of the period spent a lot energy on the longitude problem and similar navigation bottlenecks. Accurate land maps were also important for military and state finance purposes. Much of early mathematics and astronomy were focused on measuring the Earth and pinpointing your location.I’m not sure if map-making was a science explicitly, there was no UX academia like there is now, but it was certainly a serious engineering field rather than an “art”, and dismissing that rich history of know-how seems like a poor foundation for a review of map-making theory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title needs a (2001) I skimmed the paper looking for new insight only to see it talk about stuff that's already prevalent.QGIS, FME, D3, Open layers, Mapbox, and others GIS related tools has been prevalent in all the workplaces I've worked at that needed something related to this topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the interest in this article from 2001?

All other lectures are a bit more polished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless I'm missing something - do the notes cover neutrino astronomy somewhere else? Aside from the general discussion on stellar evolution. Shame, because the detection of pre-optical neutrino emission from 1987A by Kamiokande (and others) was a fantastic theoretical confirmation. Essentially when the core collapses, the environment around the surroundings are optically opaque, but the neutrinos sail on through so you'd expect to see them before the photons.https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...318L..63B/abstra...I would recommend Telescope in the Ice as one of the best introductions to modern neutrino detectors - why and where they're built. Also provides a good insight into how a big collaboration is formed, funded and operates. I've worked for IceCube so I'm somewhat biased, but the book is great just for the history.IceCube has an entire processing pathway (on ice) that is specifically designed to trigger on a supernova detection. One of the very few science results that would page us, and why uptime is absolutely critical to the experiment. On the one hand, we can't point the detector and we don't know where the signal will come from, so it's not predictable (and it's highly transient). On the other, becuase the burst happens shortly before the optical, we can use neutrinos to trigger optical observations as fast as possible - pretty much the whole observing community will drop what they're doing if a star blows up.I believe we'd expect the whole flux through the detector to bump up above the background, at least at IceCube.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our math teacher in UK high school c.1976 asked us if anyone want to join him for an adult education programming class being taught by the local university (Durham), and a bunch of us did. This was batch mode (punched card) PL/1 programming - submit job to operator and an hour later get a fanfold printout of the result. A couple of us (incl. me) had parents that worked at the University, and got the computer dept. to agree to allow us high school kids to go in on weekends etc to use the Unix system (online access) there, after the initial adult education class had ended. We spent a lot of time there, taught ourselves to program in C, and caused some amount of trouble by messing with the unix system - brute force password cracking, and on one occasion accidentally deleting the /etc/passwd file, which luckily they had backed up - they were surprisingly tolerant of all this and didn't kick us out!In March 1978 the first issue of "Personal Computer World" magazine came out, featuring the just released NASCOM-1 kit computer on the front cover. I'd just inherited 200 UKP from my grandmother, so sent it off and got myself a kit. This was a 1 MHz Z-80 system that came with 2 KB of memory (1KB for user, 1KB for system), and a built-in monitor program that let you enter programs as hex machine code. The computer itself came as bare board, bag of components to solder, and no case. It used a TV for display and cassette recorder for program/data storage. You'd hand assemble your program on paper, then enter the codes and run it. There wasn't a whole lot you could do in 1KB, but I remember coding things like a hangman game, and memorizing the op-codes well enough to program short things directly in hex.I then went to college, taking Math &amp; Comp Sci, graduating in 1982, and lucking into a dream job at Acorn Computers, which started my career as developer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In middle school my parents got me a graphing calculator for Algebra. Couldn't figure out a damn thing about how to write programs on it, and I didn't really have much computer or internet access at home, but I was curious.In the school computer lab I did some searching and found a programming guide for that model of calculator on some university website. While printing out my assignment I also secretly printed out the guide and hid it under the other papers (not supposed to be wasting ink on a personal print job). Took it home and was glued to it for months.Eventually I was able to program the game Snake. It ran slow as hell, but it ran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was 9 when I first moved to the US. I couldn't speak English so the teacher stuck me in front of the classroom computer. It was one of those monochrome all-in-one console things that must have been from the 80's and the only thing on there was Q-basic. To pass the time I followed the tutorials to create my own MUD. And that's how I learned BASIC before English.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564625</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was a rough read, not really sure I understood the authors point. It was kind of all over the place, bad because AI, bad because not really open-source, bad because doge...Only thing I really left with was the author doesn't like the word gum. Seems like a hit piece on Sahil? Pretty sure the open-source part of Gumroad has been in the works for a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So what are the alternatives to gumroad? I’d been thinking of using them to sell the PDF version of a book, but after reading about the doge thing, I feel like I need to look elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Someone recently made the point to me that the recent rise in low-code and AI-based tooling is likely going to separate out the platforms that solve tough problemsFormer design assets marketplace CEO here. Wrong ^. Low-code gives you the tools to create a website. Great. Distribution is what disrupts. Platforms won because they aggregate traffic. When you break up the platform, you diffuse the traffic along with it.The exception is sometimes there are whales: dominant content creators that win most of the clicks. If you're interested in a lot of people winning, I'm not sure that's really all that better or different from a platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603999</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The point I soured on Musk was when he ditched radar/lidar and tried to go with camera's alone. This made me realize he is not the genius he is made out to be but instead he is a fraud/charlatan and over the years his statements on different topics have only hardened that belief. Why the fuck would you want ai cars to be the same as humans you should want them to be many times better and radarr/lidar sonarr type tech make them better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem has been solved more than a decade ago by radar sensors (standard on many mid-range cars at the time). They detect imminent collisions with almost perfect accuracy and very little false positives. Having better sensor data is always going to beat trying to massage crappy data into something useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other comment pointing this out has been (ridiculously) flagged, so I'll repeat the point that was made:The analysis is useless if it doesn't account for the base rate fallacy (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)The first thing I thought before even reading the analysis was "Does the author account for it?" And indeed he makes no mention that he did.So after reading the whole article I have no idea whether Tesla's automatic driving is any worse at detecting motorcycles than my Subaru's (which BTW also uses only visual sensors).Antidisclaimer: I hate both Teslas and Musk. And my hate for one is not tied to the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601421</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of federal government layoffs on major hiking trails, specifically the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails. As funding is affected, there are concerns about the maintenance and safety of these trails, which are vital to outdoor recreation and local economies. The article highlights the importance of trail upkeep and the potential for diminished visitor experiences if services cannot be maintained due to financial constraints. It underscores the intersection of federal policy and outdoor adventurism, emphasizing the need for continued support for such recreational areas.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brookings Institute has a good plot showing how much federal spending is being cut by this administration:https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-federal-expendit...Turns out all the cuts are only a fraction of a percent of the federal budget. It's an ideological purge, nothing to do with efficiency at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These cuts are particularly nasty because federal spending on public trail maintenance is already razor thin. A ton of the Pacific Crest Trail and other scenic trails are already primarily maintained by volunteer groups doing work like log clearing, brush removal, and tread work. Trail users ourselves—hikers, mountain bikers, or trail runners—already put in hundreds of volunteer hours every season doing the basic trail work, and that's just regular seasonal maintenance. Significant work rebuilding parts of the Appalachian Trail and PCT after wildfires or hurricanes will likely not happen this year, or for years to come, unless volunteers fill in more gaps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you searched for "Arizona Trail southern terminus" you'll see what the terminus looks like today: a beautiful* monument shadowed by a half built useless wall that cost way more than the government spending to maintain some of the most beautiful trails in the world.These cuts would not just put trail users (which aren't just hikers but also firefighters, hunters) in danger but also cause damage to national parks and national forests as trail users would have to find alternate routes that go off trail.* It is, in my opinion, the most scenic terminus of all national scenic trails. The (half built) ugliness of the looming wall is an insult to the beauty of the American West.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603111</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses hydration errors in data systems, emphasizing how inaccuracies in data hydration can lead to inefficient processes and incorrect insights. It outlines common causes of hydration errors, such as misconfigured data pipelines and poor integration with database systems. The post also explores strategies to identify and mitigate these errors, including implementing automated monitoring tools and improving data governance practices. By addressing hydration errors, organizations can enhance data reliability and make better-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't help but feel that all the approaches avoiding the error by using delayed state are missing the forest for the trees. The error tells you that the client and the server disagreed on what the output is. If the client has different data, for example due to local storage, that's the expected behavior! Don't mangle your code with weird workarounds for something that isn't broken. Similar to all other rules, it's important to know when the rule should be broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One reason you may care about hydration errors is because it’s an awkward user experience.I don't know.. A hydration error is 100% an application logic error. It's not some "slightly worse UX". It means you are actually doing something incorrectly. I would even compare it to C++ UB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43583134</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Gmail's end-to-end (E2E) encryption, arguing that it falls short of expectations and poses usability concerns. It highlights the limitations of Gmail's E2E encryption, including difficulties in implementation, lack of support for certain features, and potential security vulnerabilities. The author emphasizes that while E2E encryption is a positive step towards enhancing email privacy, Gmail's execution leaves much to be desired, ultimately raising questions about its effectiveness and reliability in protecting user data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was already happening, unfortunately. The user's mail agent is deemed untrustworthy (and so is the user), so every service which needs to send confidential data just turns your email into a notification with a link. There are so many of these, but often they are limited in scope. For sectors like healthcare you have companies offering this type of service to companies which need to adhere to security theatre standards such as ISO 27001, and because nations often have their own added requirements for specific sectors (think HIPAA in the US or NEN 7510 in the Netherlands) these services tend to remain focussed on single countries.Then there are the national governments and things like insurance companies. All happily sending message notifications where you need to sign in to their own portals.Securing email is too complex, so everyone builds their own secured portal thingy, and your mailbox has become a receptacle for notifications. Figuring out a solution would require cooperation, pragmatic lawmaking, and giving up those nice cashcows of moated portals, so it won't happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in China could not open a url sent in Gmail. I happened to be in China, I tried to open the webpage and it worked, no firewall.I hovered on the link in Gmail and Chrome told me left bottom it was just that exact url.But when I opened the url it got blocked by the great firewall.Why? Any link in Gmail secretly gets replaced by a link to Google that tracks you and then redirects you to the original link.The most obnoxious thing about this I think is that Chrome shows the original link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is how all HIPAA "secure email" works. Outlook, Zoho, clinic comms, BECAUSE it lets you revoke email access.If you want an opportunity in this space, it isn't actually encrypted emails, but possibly standardizing and streamlining such "message pointers" and address endpoint verification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43604308</guid></item><item><title>39.

The industry term for lossy compression that appears to be basically the same as the source is "visually transparent" or just "transparent". Though this doesn't seem like that either, especially when you're compressing large PNGs into JPGs while naming the output as PNGs. That's just outright deceitful, and not a good look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In image compression "lossless" is a term of the art. What you're doing is a practically useful quality degradation, but it's not lossless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599470</guid></item><item><title>40.

This would seem to be the case, especially because at least one of the books with the fake economics expert seems to have been written while he was still an active faculty member there.His association with Irvine has been mentioned on national news, and although folks in academia may not realize that the general public thinks "professor emeritus" means he's still associated with the university, they're going to learn really quickly. Plus the "fake expert" thing is just so embarrassingly stupid...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time I heard this, it took me about four seconds to realize that it was an anagram of his last name. You'd think anyone reading his books might have pondered that for a minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43602777</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the leak of unfinished visual effects from the highly anticipated "Minecraft" movie, revealing early glimpses of the film's aesthetic and animation. Despite being incomplete, the leaked footage has sparked both excitement and concern among fans regarding the film’s potential. The piece emphasizes the challenges of adapting popular video games into successful films and highlights industry reactions to the leak and its implications for the film’s release.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is also why I like Yandex and non-US and non-european search especially in terms of censorship by copyright in the USA.If you go to Yandex and search "a minecraft movie torrent" the first 6 links are the preprint that variety.com 'claims' were mostly removed. In reality, the only sites deindexed were Google and Bing.This shows that the limits of the first amendment are speech when its convenient. Links, webpages, and more are speech, but also completely censored in the US media.Weirdly, Russian based companies have less a problem with the free speech the USA kicks us offline for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish studios would share these behind-the-curtain versions more often, but I suppose that would go against their apparent belief that CGI is a dirty word that can never be acknowledged even if that means outright lying about how much they used. The last Planet of the Apes movie did go there though, the 4K Bluray includes a "raw cut" of the entire movie which shows exactly what the camera saw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nfo: https://pastebin.com/iLk9B0efCOMMENTS:                                 │

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the UK's ban on misleading practices related to online products, specifically targeting £22 billion worth of "sneaky fees" and fake reviews. It highlights new regulations intended to enhance transparency and protect consumers from hidden costs and deceptive marketing tactics. The measures aim to foster fair competition among businesses and ensure that consumers can make informed decisions when shopping online. The initiative reflects growing concerns over consumer rights and the integrity of online marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599438"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the actual government announcement (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fake-reviews-and-sneaky-h...):&gt; Website hosts are accountable for the reviews on their page. Businesses and online platforms will be legally required to take steps to prevent and remove the publication of fake reviews that are published on their websites. This could include, for example, having adequate detection and removal procedures in place to prevent fake reviews being published.I guess the big question is what that ends up meaning, and how well it's enforced. If companies start getting significant fines for hosting fake reviews (especially the likes of Google and Amazon) then that might encourage them to do something about them - but that requires an enforcement agency with teeth, and for them to prove that the reviews are fake, which often isn't easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It sounds great but how do you prevent it? The sellers are all based abroad.If I look at any product on Amazon now, say a USB C cable, it’s full of fake reviews. Take this one as an example which came up as a sponsored link - 4.3/5 rated - https://amzn.eu/d/bHCXNQG - 7% of reviews are 1* and variously say that the description is misleading in capabilities of the cable, the cable broke, etc.If you look at the 5* reviews and click through to any profile writing them, they’re giving out all 5* reviews on a totally random array of cheap Chinese products. On top of that they’re always on products that no real person would buy since they’re always a mixture of things aimed at young/old and male/female, and yet the reviews are all written in the first person. If you’re not at least skeptical you will end up wasting money on rubbish. You have to now look at the distribution of reviews rather than the overall average since fake ones at 4 and 5 star swamp all else.Here in the U.K. I prefer Argos for small purchases I used to make from Amazon, but it’s not got the full range of items you might want to buy online unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to see this.Booking fee, service fee, transaction fee, technology fee, banking fee, payment handling fee, convenience fee, venue fee, ticket handling fee, verification fee, administration fee etc etc etc.So underhanded - they're just making fees up at this stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599438</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concerning case of five nurses who worked on the same floor at a Massachusetts hospital and were diagnosed with brain tumors. It explores potential links between their occupational environment and the incidence of cancer, raising questions about workplace safety and the need for investigations into possible environmental factors that could contribute to the development of such health issues among healthcare workers.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My small business produces a niche consumer electronic device. Anyone watching us operate would say that our product is Made in the USA. But the components of our product are sourced and pre-processed all over the world and our COGS just increased significantly due to tariffs.We now have to raise our prices, but our Made in China competitors have to increase theirs even more.  That isn't a net benefit for us, given the product is "nice to have" and does not have an inelastic price.If my sales drop by 50% and the Chinese competitors drop by 75%, is that winning ? I am still in shock and denial by all this. After 11 years in business, this manufactured/avoidable crisis can't be what ends us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any additional cost on top of the 'natural' costs involved with producing a result raises prices.Additional costs that direct resources to a government are a form of a tax, this includes direct taxes at the point of sale, and it should also include taxes incurred for traversing an arbitrary interface (tariff or toll).Any form of tax on goods / services proportionately effects those who spend more of their income on those goods / services more.  Tariffs on not-luxury goods are regressive taxes on the poor and middle class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs only make sense to protect a fledgling domestic industry which is already receiving investment. Even then, does anyone think that for instance US car makers will suddenly be competitive globally?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601766</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the proposal to make C string literals constant, emphasizing the benefits of this change for improving code safety and reducing bugs related to string manipulation. The author outlines the current behavior of string literals in C, which allows for unintended modifications, and suggests that enforcing constancy would lead to better practices and clearer intentions in code. The post highlights potential implications for developers and the overall enhancement of the language's robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that startups must pursue massive scale and rapid growth to be considered successful. It argues that many startups can find value and sustainability through smaller, niche markets and that prioritizing customer satisfaction and sustainable practices can lead to long-term success. The author encourages entrepreneurs to define success on their own terms rather than conforming to conventional startup norms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a model that exists in Germany, which I like:You can present a business plan to the state's investment bank and apply for several financial aides, including:* 1.5 years of universal basic income for you plus up to 2 other people. It's a tiny amount of money, but the point is to free you up to invest your actual time an money into the business. You do not have to pay this back.* up to 20k EUR in "consulting fees", for which the bank will contribute up to 50%. Again, you don't have to pay it back, but obviously you need money for them to match.* discounted loans, amount depends on business plan outlookI've worked with an accelerator that helps founders write the required pitches and plans for this program. And while the majority don't make it (because they mostly realize their idea won't actually hold up to business planning scrutiny), some do. And those don't become hyperscaling unicorns, they become normal companies, growing organically as stable, solvent employers in the region.Every once in a while a VC would stick its head in and encourage the startup to take on VC funding, and for an even smaller percentage (one in my time doing this), this worked. But for me, the organic growers are the best success story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in a country (Germany) that is famous for having a lot of "mittelstand". These are basically family owned businesses. Some large German companies fall under this. Aldi and LIDL for example, which are super market chains that at this point have a global presence. And some large companies (Bosch, Siemens, VW, etc.) are actually a multitude of smaller companies. Much of the German economy is smaller and bigger specialized companies doing their thing. Only some of them are public companies.What these companies have in common is that they start small and then grow organically. The main issue from a VC point of view is not that these aren't good companies but that it can take decades for them to turn into big companies. But from the point of view of the people founding these businesses, it's a good, honest way to succeed in life.There's nothing wrong with the principle of starting a company to make money from whatever it is you do at whatever scale you are doing it. But it should drive your decision making as to whether or not you give chunks of your company away to an investor. It might stop being your company if you do.Also, if you go down this path. Stop calling yourself a startup. It scares away customers. They don't want to hear that you are a flaky wannabe that is still figuring it out. They want to hear about your other customers and how awesome whatever it is you are selling is. They want to be re-assured that it is safe for them to enter into a multi year customer relationship with you. Projecting that you are new to all this company stuff and might not be around in six months is exactly the wrong message for them. They don't want to hear about what you are going to do, they want to hear about what you have done already. The stuff that gets VCs horny will scare away customers. If you are pitching customers and VCs at the same time, make sure you have two very different pitches. And if you are going to pitch VCs, it actually helps if you have customers. The more business you have the stronger your negotiation position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always conflicted about this because it's like saying the sky is blue.Stepping outside of the VC startup bubble, we see small self-funded businesses are the norm. It's the neighborhood businesses all around us.82% of all US business have &lt;10 employees

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am so conflicted about this project every time it comes up.I think I understood for quite some time what it wants to do (Though when checking the website there always creeps in doubt, because it is so incomprehensible) and every year when I download the application again, it looks a bit more cleaner, a bit easier to just use. But still, basic things always elude me. Do I really have to read the handbook to figure out how to format text in the knowledge base? Half the windows and symbols just make no sense, etc. Try pressing a button to see what it does and now everything looks different and what even happened?It seems to glacially improve on that front and I know to really use it, I have to learn to program it, but I am also of the mind basic functionality should be self explanatory. And pharo itself as the basis of this seems so convoluted and complex, I wonder if I even want to get into this.And then, the community seems to solely be on discord still, and that is then always the point were I bow out and wonder if cuis smalltalk or other systems with simplicity as core tenant are not much nicer to use and I should look there. Of course, in the end, I never get more than surface deep into smalltalk, because while I want the tools to build my own environment, if I need to build them first, there is always more pressing work...But honestly, a great knowledge base and data visualization I can intuitively just use and then expand later on with my own programs sounds like a dream workspace. It's just, that it is really hard to get into at the moment. I don't know any python, but I could just use jupyter know and learn as I go, but sadly, I never get that feeling here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome.  Had a feeling this was going to be a smalltalk thing.  Seems to involve/extend moose[1] among other things.Judging from the comments and such interesting projects languishing in obscurity.. smalltalk / pharo[2] still has a PR problem even though I think a lot of people are kind of fascinated by the ideas of image-based persistence[3].  The typical easy comparisons to VMs, IDEs, and notebooks all seem to fail to capture an important part of the essence.  Hence the need for new vocabulary like "moldable development" and "contextual micro tools" which is all part of the appeal and part of the problem.  It really is a different kind of thing.I (still) hope it all catches on a bit more but my sense is that it probably needs to present itself as a bit less academic.  Compare the moose touting of "meta-meta-modeling" with something like gritql[4], which focuses more on use-cases, and seems to be gaining in popularity rather than remaining obscure.  Seems like maybe it's time for a change in tactics to bring in a wider audience.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_(analysis)

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the Camera RAW format, which is a type of file used by digital cameras to store unprocessed image data. It discusses how different manufacturers, such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Fujifilm, create their own RAW formats, leading to compatibility issues in post-processing. The piece highlights Adobe's Digital Negative (DNG) format as a standardized alternative that can preserve image quality while ensuring broader compatibility across software and devices. The article also delves into the advantages of using RAW files for photographers, including greater control over editing, and explores the implications of adopting DNG as a universal format.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, RAW formats aren't that complex, and camera firmware is mostly developed in countries that don't have strong open source software traditions.Look at the decoders for each format that darktable supports here:
https://github.com/darktable-org/rawspeed/tree/develop/src/l...It's some binary parsing, reading metadata, maybe doing some decompression-- a thousand lines of C++ on average for each format. These aren't complex codecs like HEVC and only reach JPEG complexity by embedding them as thumbnails!Cameras absolutely could emit DNG instead, but that would require more development friction: coordination (with Adobe), potentially a language barrier, and potentially making it harder to do experimental features.Photographers rarely care, so it doesn't appreciably impact sales. Raw processing software packages have generally good support available soon after new cameras are released.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raw decoding is not as simple as you might think.It’s the best place to add “signature steps.” Things like noise reduction, chromatic aberration correction, and one-step HDR processing.I used to work for a camera manufacturer, and our Raw decoder was an extremely intense pipeline step. It was treated as one of the biggest secrets in the company.Third-party deinterlacers could not exactly match ours, although they could get very good results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One problem is that you cannot have a universal format that is both truly raw and doesn't embed camera specific information. Camera sensors from different companies (and different generations) don't have the same color (or if you prefer, spectral) responses with both their Bayer filter layer and the underlying physical sensor. If you have truly raw numbers, you need the specific spectral response information to interpret them; if you don't need spectral response information, you don't actually have truly raw numbers. People very much want raw numbers for various reasons, and also camera companies are not really enthused about disclosing the spectral response characteristics of their sensors (although people obviously reverse engineer them anyway).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580815</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An important caveat from the paper&gt;Moreover, we follow previous work in accelerating block breaking because learning to hold a button for hundreds of consecutive steps would be infeasible for stochastic policies, allowing us to focus on the essential challenges inherent in Minecraft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The “holding a button” thing actually resonated. It feels like the real work here is engineering the reward structure to make exploration even remotely viable. Dreamer’s world model might be cool, but most of the heavy lifting still seems to come from how forgiving the Minecraft environment is for training.I do wonder though: if you swapped Minecraft for a cloud-based synthetic world with similar physics but messier signals, like object permanence or social reasoning, would Dreamer still hold up? Or is it just really good at the kind of clean reward hierarchies that games offer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key to Dreamer’s success, says Hafner, is that it builds a model of its surroundings and uses this ‘world model’ to ‘imagine’ future scenarios and guide decision-making.Can you look at the world model, like you can look at Waymo's world model? Or is it hidden inside weights?Machine learning with world models is very interesting, and the people doing it don't seem to say much about what the models look like. The Google manipulation work talks endlessly about the natural language user interface, but when they get to motion planning, they don't say much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584015</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The repository hosts the "Elimination Game," a coding project that involves creating a game where players are sequentially eliminated based on specific rules or mechanics. It includes source code, documentation, and instructions for setting up and running the game. The project aims to demonstrate programming skills and game development concepts, providing a collaborative environment for developers to contribute, modify, or learn from the existing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's an interesting benchmark. It feels like it tests skills that are very relevant to digital assistants, story writing and role play.Some thoughts about the setup:- the setup seems to give reasoning models an inherent advantage because only they have a private plan and a public text in the same output. I feel like giving all models the option to formulate plans and keep track of other players inside &lt;think&gt; or &lt;secret&gt; tags would level the playing field more.- from personal experience with social tasks for LLMs it helps both reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to explicitly ask them to plan their next steps, in a way they are assured is kept hidden from all other players. That might be a good addition here either before or after the public subround- the individual rounds are pretty short. Humans would struggle to coordinate in so few exchanges with so few words. If this was done for context limitations, asking models to summarize the game state from their perspective, then giving them only the current round, the previous round and their own summary of the game before that might be a good strategy.It would be cool to have some code to play around with to test how changes in the setup change the results. I guess it isn't that difficult to write, but it's peculiar to have the benchmark but no code to run it yourself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was interested to find that the Claudes did the most betraying, and were betrayed very little; somewhat surprising given its boy-scout exterior.(Then again, apparently the president of the local Diplomacy Society attends my church; I discovered this when another friend whom I'd invited saw him, and quipped that he was surprised he hadn't been struck by lightning at the door.)DeepSeek and Gemini 2.5 had both a low betrayer and betrayed rate.o3-mini and DeepSeek had the highest number of first-place finishes, but were only in the upper quartile in the TrueSkill leaderboard; presumably because they played more risky strategies, that would either lead ot complete winning or early drop-out?Also interesting that o1 was only way to sway the final jury a bit more than 50% of the time, while o3-mini managed 63% of the time.Anyway, really cool stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using QwQ-32B a lot recently and while I quite like it (especially given its size), I noticed it will often misinterpret the system prompt as something I (the user) said, revealing secrets or details that only the agent is supposed to know. When I saw that it topped the "earliest out" chart, I wondered if that was part of the reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43586380</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Baby Steps into Genetic Programming" discusses the fundamentals of genetic programming (GP) and its application in solving problems. It introduces the concept of evolving programs and algorithms using principles inspired by natural selection, explaining how solutions can be automatically generated through iterative processes. The author outlines basic components of GP, including representation, selection, and mutation, while providing practical examples to illustrate the concepts. The aim is to provide readers with a foundational understanding of genetic programming and its potential uses in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the website (ai-contest.com) that the post links to seems to have been hijacked by a gambling site.For the use-cases where Genetic Programming was popular, I would recommend looking at Bayesian Optimization (bayesopt) as an alternative today (I know I keep recommending the area - but I hope I do when it is relevant :-)). This is mostly because IMHO it has a principled foundation that has been productively developed further in the past few years. Here's a good book on the topic [1], and I've a tutorial as well [2]. Interestingly one of the books I had encountered when reading up on Genetic Algo. years ago was by Melanie Mitchell [3]!Bayesopt or Genetic Programming, or any search algorithm that can operate over non-differentiable objective functions are very useful in practice. For ex, when performing model selection in the space of hyperparameters, when your model is not differentiable such as a traditional Decision Tree [4]. Or exotic use-cases like molecule discovery [5].You can try out bayesopt using the botorch or hyperopt libraries. The latter only implements a specific bayesopt algo. which was/is popular but it seems to have been bettered of late [4].[1] https://bayesoptbook.com/[2] Part 1 https://blog.quipu-strands.com/bayesopt_1_key_ideas_GPs[3] Found a free copy online https://www.boente.eti.br/fuzzy/ebook-fuzzy-mitchell.pdf[4] "... Analysis of the Black-Box Optimization Challenge 2020" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v133/turner21a.html[5] ChemBO is an example but there are others https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/korovina20a.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice writeup, short so is more approachable than John Koza’s classic book on GP. That said, if GP looks useful to you, eventually read Koza’s book, or at least experiment with his Common Lisp code.Also don’t confuse Genetic Algorithms (GA) with GP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naive question: what are the most suitable problems that Genetic Programming is to solve, despite that machine learning especially deep learning is all the rage now? Or do we have models that integrate genetic programming into deep learning?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605731</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have encountered my fair share of in-house RC4 implementations from the 90s.  Every single one of them was vulnerable in some way.  They suffered from all kinds of issues: improper IV initialisation, predictable keystreams, and even partial leakage of plaintext into ciphertext.  RC4's deceptively simple specification made it enticing to implement, giving developers a false sense of confidence and security.As another example, Microsoft Outlook 2003 infamously used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords: &lt;https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/pst_password_bug.html&gt;.  Naturally, it was trivial to find a CRC32 checksum collision and open someone else's PST.Thankfully, the industry has come a long way since then.  These days, rolling your own cipher is, quite rightly, considered a red flag!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why waste 2 seconds of my time making your website have a splash screen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this would be less fun, but given that the key space was only 36^4, why not just run the actual decryption functionality in QText? Like, even if it takes 1 second to decrypt, spin up 32 cores and wait a day. They allude to the idea that checking the key derivation is faster, but I wonder by how much.(of course, it’s still interesting to read about 90s encryption, so I appreciate that they did it the fun way)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612102</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article celebrates the 20th anniversary of Git, highlighting its development history, key features, and its impact on software development. It outlines how Git originated from Linus Torvalds' need for a distributed version control system for the Linux kernel and discusses its growth and adoption in the tech community. The piece also emphasizes Git's role in facilitating collaboration among developers, enhancing workflow efficiency, and supporting modern software development practices. Additionally, it reflects on the future of Git and the ongoing evolution of version control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s something that bothers me about these sorts of recollections that make git seem… inevitable.There’s this whole creation myth of how Git came to be that kind of paints Linus as some prophet reading from golden tablets written by the CS gods themselves.Granted, this particular narrative in the blog post does humanise a bit more, remembering the stumbling steps, how Linus never intended for git itself to be the UI, how there wasn’t even a git commit command in the beginning, but it still paints the whole thing in somewhat romantic tones, as if the blob-tree-commit-ref data structure were the perfect representation of data.One particular aspect that often gets left out of this creation myth, especially by the author of Github is that Mercurial had a prominent role. It was created by Olivia Mackall, another kernel hacker, at the same time as git, for the same purpose as git. Olivia offered Mercurial to Linus, but Linus didn’t look upon favour with it, and stuck to his guns. Unlike git, Mercurial had a UI at the very start. Its UI was very similar to Subversion, which at the time was the dominant VCS, so Mercurial always aimed for familiarity without sacrificing user flexibility. In the beginning, both VCSes had mind share, and even today, the mindshare of Mercurial lives on in hg itself as well as in worthy git successors such as jujutsu.And the git data structure isn’t the only thing that could have ever possibly worked. It falls apart for large files. There are workaround and things you can patch on top, but there are also completely different data structures that would be appropriate for larger bits of data.Git isn’t just plain wonderful, and in my view, it’s not inevitable either. I still look forward to a world beyond git, whether jujutsu or whatever else may come.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 2002 or so, I had an idea to tag every part of a project with a unique hash code. With a hash code, one could download the corresponding file. A hash code for the whole project would be a file containing a list of hash codes for the files that make up the project. Hash codes could represent the compiler that builds it, along with the library(s) it links with.I showed it to a couple software entrepreneuers (Wild Tangent and Chromium), but they had no interest in it.I never did anything else with it, and so it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I started using Git for something you might not imagine it was intended for, only a few months after it’s first commitI started using git around 2007 or so because that company I worked for at the time used ClearCase, without a doubt the most painful version manager I have ever used (especially running it from a Linux workstation). So I wrote a few scripts that would let me mirror a directory into a git repo, do all my committing in git, then replay those commits back to ClearCase.I can't recall how Git came to me attention in the first place, but by late 2008 I was contributing patches to Git itself. Junio was a kind but exacting maintainer, and I learned a lot about contributing to open source from his stewardship. I even attended one of the early GitTogethers.As far as I can recall, I've never really struggled with git. I think that's because I like to dissect how things work, and under the covers git is quite simple. So I never had too much trouble with its terribly baroque CLI.At my next job, I was at a startup that was building upon a fork of Chromium. At the time, Chromium was using subversion. But at this startup, we were using git, and I was responsible for keeping our git mirror up-to-date. I also had the terrible tedious job of rebasing our fork with Chromium's upstream changes. But boy did I get good at resolving merge conflicts.Git may be the CLI I've used most consistently for nearly two decades. I'm disappointed that GitHub became the main code-review tool for Git, but I'll never be disappointed that Git beat out Mercurial, which I always found overly ridged and was never able to adapt it to my workflow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613305</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I evaluated D1 for a project a few months ago, and found that global performance was pretty terrible. I don't know what exactly the issue with their architecture is, but if you look at the time-to-first-byte numbers here[1], you can see that even for the D1 demo database the numbers outside Europe are abysmal, and even within Europe having a TTFB of &gt; 200ms isn't great.This post helps understand some basic DB pitfalls for frontend developers, but I wouldn't use D1 regardless. If you can figure out how to use D1 as a frontend dev, you can use a hosted Postgres solution and get much more power and performance.[1] https://speedvitals.com/ttfb-test?url=https://northwind.d1sq...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone tried analyzing Durable Object with SQL storage performance? Is it as bad as D1?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another fun limitation is that a transaction cannot span multiple D1 requests, so you can't select from the database, execute application logic, and then write to the database in an atomic way. At most, you can combine multiple statements into a single batch request that is executed atomically.When I needed to ensure atomicity in such a multi-part "transaction", I ended up making a batch request, where the first statement in the batch checks a precondition and forces a JSON parsing error if the precondition is not met, aborting the rest of the batch statements.  SELECT
    IIF(&lt;precondition&gt;, 1, json_extract("inconsistent", "$")) AS consistent

&lt;p&gt;The article "Where the Money Comes From" by Sean Goedecke explores the various sources of funding for philanthropic endeavors and nonprofit organizations. It highlights the importance of understanding the diversity of revenue streams, including individual donations, corporate sponsorships, grants from foundations, and government funding. The piece emphasizes the need for transparency and strategic planning in fundraising efforts, as well as the impact that economic conditions and donor motivations can have on financial support. Ultimately, it aims to provide insights into optimizing funding strategies for sustainable impact.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"At successful tech companies, engineering work is valued in proportion to how much money it makes the company"You would think that,  but decades of experience have disproved that.Most of management, past first-gen if the company was founded by engineers, is non-technical.Most are (more or less) aware that somewhere technical engineering in software is needed, but they feel that as a threath rather than an asset. If engineering is not a commodity, they fear being called out for not being in touch with the grounded reality of the business, and fear the  unpredictability this entails for their own operation.So they will tend to treat engineering like a commodity, generic and interchangable at will, and even deliberatly not recognize differential contribution by engineers to the company's success.This is also why once non-technical management has consolidated, rising from engineering into management will become very difficult, often requiring you deny your technical competences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article makes the naive assumption that "what is making money" is an objective thing.Once a company reaches a certain size, basically once it has a financial planning department w/ different VPs owning their PnL, who is making money increasingly becomes a social construct. "how to get promoted" by spakhm is much more closer to how a large, successful org works IMO: https://spakhm.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promotedI've seen this in my career multiple times. For example, when I was involved in search for some companies, we would demonstrate through A/B testing that we would make X more money per month. Executive team changed, they decided that "A/B test does not work and slows us down", the definition of making money changed, we overnight went from a money-aking org to a cost center.Nowadays, most companies are pushing GenAI everywhere. Most of those things don't make money, and yet a lot of promotions will be obtained across the board until the tune ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on a product that has been built over 25 years. Lots of the work I did years ago is to ensure the product longevity.Lots of the work I do now is to ensure it lasts another 25 years. Thats good, but its only the start of "my work".It's up to me to "sell" that benefit to upper management. There's no point in assuming they'll figure it out by accident. Part of my job is enumerating the value I add.By all means work on technical debt. But be sure to make a compelling case as to how the eradication of that debt will impact the project over the next decade. Try and throw in immediate results as well (faster, more reliable, reduced support) but more importantly translate that into terms that measure the improvement in cold hard cash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43603646</guid></item><item><title>14.

We already package lua and a few C extensions. C extensions are the bread and butter for Pixi, so I think it could be a good fit!- pixi.sh (docs)
- lua package on the registry: https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/lua&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution env is the achille's heel of scripting languages. Personally I don't use Neovim, but had a feeling its adoption would spur development in this area for Lua. Bryan Cantrill called Javascript "LISP in C's clothes". In some ways I feel like Lua is the opposite, and love it for those reasons (disclaimer: never had to use it at work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know some projects like Koreader[1] use Lua as their primary application language. If you could convince one of them to switch, it would provide some assurances about the maturity and popularity of the idea.[1]: https://github.com/koreader/koreader&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614285</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Rive has redefined the concept of feathering in the context of vector graphics, moving beyond traditional methods to enhance creativity and precision in design. It explains that Rive’s approach allows for more fluid and dynamic animations while maintaining control over the visual quality of vector art. By integrating feathering techniques that respond to user interactions, Rive aims to provide designers with innovative tools for creating engaging and interactive experiences in the modern digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Hoping for a follow-up that dives in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can achieve a gaussian blur effect using an infinite impulse response thing[1]. Some very clever people at IBM came up with the idea, and some other very clever people translated that code to Javascript and stuck it on GitHub for the rest of the world to use[2].[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response[2] - https://github.com/nodeca/glur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not completely buying this. He's claiming that it's better to do vector based feathering, but it's not at all clear that his approach isn't just as computationally expensive, or more. Filters do require a lot of calculations, but they are embarrassingly parallel and also you get help from the Convolution Theorem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577338</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains Daylight Saving Time (DST), its historical origins, and the rationale behind its implementation. It discusses how DST affects timekeeping, including changes to clocks, and analyzes its impact on energy consumption, health, and productivity. The post also highlights the ongoing debates regarding the necessity and effectiveness of DST and explores various perspectives on whether it should be eliminated or maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great work - one of the rules for code written with Basis was not to use the system clock. I somewhat got around the network determinism by shimming out all network calls, and rather than going single threaded, writing a scheduler (https://basisrobotics.tech/2024/09/02/determinism/). My goal wasn’t to get ci-&gt;dev machine determinism, at least immediately, because callback ordering determinism was so important. Love seeing other work done in this space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the advantage of integrating this at a library level instead of just compiling it and running in Shadow? https://github.com/shadow/shadow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it was mentioned at the end, I was curious what are some of the notable issues that were find using the DST approach, and how did it benefit the development of the   system? I would also be curious if a LLM system would be able to help analyze the TRACE logs ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581900</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how approximately 90% of the data stored in data centers is considered "crap data," which refers to data that is redundant, outdated, or irrelevant. It emphasizes the inefficiencies and costs associated with managing this excess data, highlighting that organizations need to prioritize data management and governance to improve decision-making and optimize storage resources. The piece advocates for a focus on quality data over quantity to enhance overall business value and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One organization I knew of had 1,500 terabytes of data, with less than 2% ever having been accessed after it was first stored.On a related note, probably a similar percentage of people claim on their car insurance. If only the rest realised they had "crap insurance" and were paying for nothing, they could save so much money!This is obviously sarcasm, but I think it's important to remember that much of the data is stored because we don't know what we will need later. Photos of kids? Maybe that one will be The One that we end up framing? Miscellaneous business records? Maybe those will be the ones we have to dig out for a tax audit? Web pages on government sites? Maybe there will suddenly be an interest in obscure pages on public health policy if a global pandemic happens.Complaining that data is mostly junk is not a particularly interesting conclusion without acknowledging this. Is there wastage? Yeah sure, but accuracy on what needs storing is directly traded off with time spent figuring that out, and often it's cheaper to store the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About a decade and a half ago I worked on a large data migration project at a FAANG. Multi-exabyte scale, many clusters across many countries. Once everyone was moved the old storage platform wasn't completely empty, because the number of migrations was large and users were (naturally) more focused on ensuring their data was in place and available on the target platform rather than ensuring every last thing was deleted on the legacy platform. We weren't initially concerned about it because it would all get deleted when we turned down the old setup.As we were gearing up to declare victory and start turning down the several dozen legacy storage clusters someone mused that given some users were subject to litigation holds -- not allowed to delete any data -- that at least some of the leftover data on the old system might be subject to litigation hold, and we'd need to figure that out before we could delete it or incur legal risk. IIRC the leftover 'junk' data amounted to a few dozen petabytes spread across multiple clusters around the world, in different jurisdictions. We spent several months talking with the lawyers figuring that out. It was an interesting dance, because on the one hand we were quite confident that there was unlikely to be anything in the leftovers which was both meaningful and not migrated to the new platform, while on the other hand explaining that it wasn't practical to just "go and look" through a few dozen PB of data. I recall we ended up somewhere in between, coming up with ways to distinguish categories of data like caches and working data from various pipelines. It added over six months to the project, but was quite an interesting problem to work through that hadn't occurred to any of us earlier on, as we were thinking entirely in technical terms about infrastructure migration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some fun math: according to some estimates there is 175 zettabytes of data worldwide. Assuming 20-terabyte harddrives, this could be stored on 8.8 billion drives. Assuming 10 drives per rack unit, 42 RU per rack cabinet, 16 square feet per cabinet (including aisle space), that means you need about 330 million square feet of data center space to host this data. If it was hosted in a single square data center, it would be 3.5 miles long and wide. (I always like to picture the physical space something would occupy.) And energy wise, assuming 5 watts per drive, it would consume 44 gigawatt, so it could be powered by about two large hydro dams similar to the Three Gorges Dam (22 gigawatts capacity). I am assuming a PUE close to 1.0 for simplicity. Of course one would not be able to spin up all these drives at once, since a drive spinning up consumes about three times more power (15 watts). So you would definitely staggered spin up when booting the servers :-)If 90% of this data is "crap" and could be cut down, it would still be just a drop in the bucket compared to worldwide energy use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695</guid></item><item><title>20.

That distribution patched sshd to link against libsystemd, which in turn linked against a variety of compression packages, including xz's liblzma. Debian's relaxing of sshd's dependency posture was a key enabler for the attack, as well as the reason its impact was limited to Debian-based systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, avoiding other distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, and NixOS.Does Fedora use Debian's patch set for sshd, or a similar patch set that adds libsystemd?Edit: It looks like Fedora wasn't affected because the backdoor triggered a valgrind test failure, so they shipped it with a flag that disabled the functionality that was backdoored. Seems like they lucked out. https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very suspicious article. Sounds like the "nothing to see here folks, move along" school of security.Reproducibility is more like a security smell; a symptom you’re doing things right. Determinism is the correct target and subtly different.The focus on supply chain is a distraction, a variant of The “trusting trust” attack Ken Thompson described in 1984 is still among the most elegant and devastating. Infected development toolchains can spread horizontally to “secure” builds.Just because it’s open doesn’t mean anyone’s been watching closely. "50 years of security"? Important pillars of OSS have been touched by thousands of contributors with varying levels of oversight. Many commits predate strong code-signing or provenance tracking. If a compiler was compromised at any point, everything it compiled—including future versions of itself—could carry that compromise forward invisibly. This includes even "cleanroom" rebuilds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614199</guid></item><item><title>21.

Sometimes I'll be sending emails including both my client and internal team and the lawyers for the other side. The phone will decade that these email addresses are related in some way. So next time I want to send an internal strategy email to my client and the team, the app will helpfully suggest copying opposing counsel.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "hasochism," which refers to a form of programming and reasoning that embraces the use of high-level abstractions while still engaging with low-level details. The author explores how this approach allows for a more manageable way of handling complex systems by combining rigorous mathematical frameworks and practical programming techniques.

It will come with both sets of front panels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations on getting the vector display working as well! Now we can have the world's most baroque Spacewar! mini arcade machine ever ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have so much fun with my PiDP-11 that this will have to go on the list.Does anyone know if MIDAS has been recreated for it or not?A bit of the hint on the PPT reader, which would be awesome, the rp2xxx chips PIO can handle that with ease.  As the PDP1 doesn't have take-up it is pretty trivial to make at 'historic' speeds.  Obviously punching is much more difficult.I looked into it for quite a bit, but not having access to tapes, puncher, supplies etc... I gave up on the idea as the PiDP-10 will scratch my personal nostalgia itch a bit more right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595326</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a rather sizable collection of 1980s home computers with over a hundred different models (virtually all of the Ataris, Amigas, Apples, 
Commodores, Radio Shacks, Sinclairs, Amstrads, Dragons, MSX machines, etc). I started collecting them in the early 90s when most were less than $5 at thrift stores and I'd stopped collecting by the year 2000 because I basically had them all.Collecting back when they were considered basically worthless junk by most people meant I paid no more than $30 for any one machine and most were actually given to me for free or shipping cost. I do have an Interact but it's one of the few I've never booted up as I never had one back in the day and being so obscure it wasn't one of the computers I lusted after but couldn't afford in the 80s. This article has inspired me to dig it out and fire it up. I heard from someone a few years back that apparently Interacts are quite valuable now due to their rarity (not that I'm in the market to sell any of mine).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still have the Troll Hole Adventure on tape, along with the Interact that I learned programming on (MS basic! and machine code - we didn't have an assembler).As I recall, you don't flick the lighter you "flick bic" as was the marketing slogan at the time. The response would rhyme "flick bic" lead to "lamps lit". Other exciting things were using the paper tube from the bathroom and the lenses from somewhere else to "make telescope" which allowed you to read a distant sign or billboard.... Fun times.Oh right, there's a shovel and if you "dig frog" the response was "I can dig it" because you know... the 1970's...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Trinity (I'd call them 2nd generation home computers with a screen and keyboard as opposed to 1st gen like the Altair that had a front panel and/or attached to a terminal) were easy to beat in terms of cost by third generation computers (TRS-80 Color Computer, VIC-20, Atari 400, ...) were based on ASIC for glue instead of the discrete logic used in the 2nd gen.Modern attempts to build retrocomputers run into trouble being authentic because production runs are too small to justify an ASIC so they wind up using an FPGA or ESP32 for a display controller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43614081</guid></item><item><title>26.

I can't DM you on HN and there's no contact on your website, so sorry for the public security disclosure. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why in our codebase we have a rule to not use short options/flags for called commands like curl.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The obvious methodology at work here is 'fire everyone then hopefully re-hire only what is blindingly obviously needed'. There are many, many problems with this approach in a business setting but even more from a governmental setting. The first, and what should be obvious to anyone with an ounce of empathy, is that these are real people who's lives are being toyed with. It isn't like you are trying out a new business process. You are literally playing with entire lives here as if they are disposable things. This alone makes what is happening inhumane. Even if it did make things more 'efficient' I would rather a humane government than whatever efficient government they are aiming for here. The second incredibly obvious reason why this is wrong is because this isn't a business. Money isn't the point. Let me repeat this one more time. Money is not the point of a government. I can't understand any argument about government efficiency that only looks at money. It is about total benefit to society, period. If you hire someone that is 'breakeven' in what they produce vs consume from a pure production point of view you could argue that for a business they should go, but from a government point of view you have employed someone and that person is churning the rest of the economy and society has one less drain. In other words all of society is way better off with that breakeven, or even net negative, person employed in government. In other words, an efficient government actually can have what would be considered waste in a corporate world and that is not only OK, but the right answer. I know of several people that are 'employed' but net negatives and society is way better off with that arrangement than having them on the streets. Is there a place for money/efficiency discussions in government? Sure, but if it is the only thing you look at then you really need to re-think things. There are many, many other ways this is morally and economically wrong but those are my top two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general it is a good practice to assume other parties are making a good faith effort, but after so many obvious cockups, that grace has been exhausted.My assumption is that there is a lot of blow-back so they are restoring a few high profile names so they can say, "see, we aren't stopping science!". It is good this handful of people are back on the job, but I assume the NIH is like most other organizations -- the top name isn't doing the work themselves. They lead a team of people and their expertise is used to provide them direction and as a resource to help analyze surprising results. If the top experts lose their staff, I doubt they'll get nearly as much done. Having the 65 year old braintrust spending hours pipetting and staining samples is wildly inefficient. DOGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any proof that they're coding errors? A simpler explanation, to me at least, is that they first blanket fired people by dubious criteria, and are now using this as an excuse to backpedal when they realize they've cut something important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606315</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the resurgence of the dire wolf, a prehistoric species that once roamed North America. It highlights recent scientific advancements and discoveries that have reignited interest in this ancient predator, including genetic research and paleontological findings. The piece explores the implications of bringing back such a species through de-extinction efforts, touching on ecological, ethical, and social considerations surrounding the process. It reflects on how the dire wolf's return could reshape our understanding of extinction and biodiversity in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's ethical, but I hate that it's fakehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolf#DNA_evidence Look at this caldogram and text&gt; The sequences indicate the dire wolf to be a highly divergent lineage which last shared a most recent common ancestor with the wolf-like canines 5.7 million years ago. The study also measured numerous dire wolf and gray wolf skeletal samples that showed their morphologies to be highly similar, which had led to the theory that the dire wolf and the gray wolf had a close evolutionary relationship. The morphological similarity between dire wolves and gray wolves was concluded to be due to convergent evolution. Members of the wolf-like canines are known to hybridize with each other but the study could find no indication of genetic admixture from the five dire wolf samples with extant North American gray wolves and coyotes nor their common ancestor. This finding indicates that the wolf and coyote lineages evolved in isolation from the dire wolf lineage.There are a lot of extant species that are as closely related as the wolf. Cheating based on phenotype sucks. We want real genetic diversity!Best case, the female wolves they just just made are suitable mothers for the next round of hybrids, so they converge over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's[0] a recent editorial about Colossal, the company behind this.Basically, they make some flimsy claims about conservation and combating climate change to justify creating a poor imitation of Jurassic Park. Naturally, there's some real moral dilemmas that they gloss over in pursuit of the money a few wealthy people will pay to be able to say "I saw a Mammoth!"[0]: https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/editorial-mammoth-de...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be neat if they opened a theme park on a remote island filled with de-extinct creatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43609661</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an anagram solver tool that allows users to input words or phrases to generate a list of possible anagrams. It features a user-friendly interface where users can easily enter their text and view the results, which display all the valid anagrams that can be formed from the given input. The tool aims to assist with word games, puzzles, and other language-related activities, enhancing creativity and vocabulary skills.&lt;/p&gt;

  For better dynamics, consider varying the words length. It appears to me that you are serving only words with five letters.

  It appears that you are having a bug that prevents the game from running smoothly on the following browsers: Firefox (Windows) and Brave (Windows/Android). I tried other browsers/OSes and the game was running perfectly: Chrome/Edge (Windows), Safari (iOS) and Firefox (Android). Apparently, the script at "https://cloud.umami.is/script.js" is not being loaded which causes an exception to happen when you lose; this prevents the game to show "Try Again" and the screen goes blank instead where you have to refresh the page to play again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if it showed you something when it ended instead of just having the page go blank. . .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a fun game. I made an anagram game myself a few years ago.https://conundrum.fun/Seeing some of the other comments reminded me that most of the work went into trimming the word lists so that it wasn't rude or randomly impossibly difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578444</guid></item><item><title>31.

The professor was very clear that we should translate it in the spirit it was written, which is to say, vulgar.I offered the following translation of the first line:"I will fuck you up the ass, and jam my cock down your throat."The professor then said, "Excellent. Tonally perfect. Now let us never speak of it again."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think when I was around 12-13 or so, a new Latin teacher (fairly young - not long out of university) had our class reading Catullus.I'm sure you can imagine the reaction of a roomful of teenage boys reading Latin poetry that iirc involved quite a lot of masturbation...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612807</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Quartz, a global business news organization that launched in 2012 and aimed to provide high-quality journalism with a focus on the digital audience. It highlights Quartz’s innovative approach to news delivery, including an engaging website design and a shift toward mobile storytelling, which contributed to its rapid growth and popularity. The piece also notes the challenges Quartz faced over the years, including economic pressures and changes in the media landscape, leading to its eventual acquisition by a larger company. Ultimately, the article reflects on Quartz's impact on the media industry and its legacy in redefining digital news consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quartz wasn't "destroyed" by cynicism; it collapsed due to its own financial unsustainability.Investors didn’t kill Quartz—they stopped subsidizing losses once it was clear Quartz couldn't become self-sufficient.The "cynical" narrative obscures Quartz’s fundamental flaw: lack of a viable business model.Calling Quartz a victim overlooks that it repeatedly failed commercially, despite many chances and significant investment.Ultimately, Quartz’s fate wasn't about cynicism, but about investors deciding to stop throwing money into a losing bet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing about that article surprises me regarding G/O but there is one point that Zach makes about his transaction that he is wrong about:"Thanks to G/O's stubborn insistence that it only wanted Quartz's assets and not the corporate entity"...this is not stubborn it's quite common and is absolutely the right thing to do for many companies interested in another business. If they buy your entity (stock transaction) it comes with all the legal liability.Zach probably doesn't understand how much more likely his deal was to close as an asset purchase rather than a stock purchase. A stock purchase comes with lots more diligence and legalese. If they are buying your stock they are buying all your baggage and potential legal matters, it requires a lot more work including a laundry list of representations by the seller. G/O did everyone a favor by sticking to an asset purchase and getting the deal done. that's where the positives end it seems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it. In the subject line of his email announcing the deal, he spelled our name "Quarts," and that set the tone for the level of care in what he had bought.This little detail seems to sum up so much about this kind of acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616604</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know Domino exceedingly well. I started working with it in '94, and continued with it in one form or another until 2021. My last gig with it  was even a Domino-based SaaS that reached over 8 figures ARR, and is still up and running. Everything in this post sounds completely accurate. Domino is absolutely a viable platform from the back-end, database perspective.But that is not the important point when deciding whether to use it, because it is absolutely not a viable platform from the "Can you find a team to actually code on this platform?" perspective.By the time I had finished with that last gig, I told everyone the same thing: That I personally knew both Domino and modern web frameworks and could blend them together to have a modern front-end on that back-end. But I figure there are a couple dozen people in the world who know both sides well enough to do so, because the industry moved on. The talent moved on. Or retired. Most of my work post-2009 was decommission projects.  At the same time, new frameworks have come to fruition since the 90s, so all the special features Domino has baked in just aren't that unique anymore. There are also almost no jobs in it, so no reason for people to learn it.At the end of the day, you cannot run a company on a tech stack where there is no talent pool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just yesterday, I put up a blog about tracking down a date / time bug in Domino / Notes:What happened on December 13, 2024? [1][1] https://bostick.github.io/blog/2025/04/what-happened/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First Lotus Domino gig in 1998 and worked with it for several years until SharePoint started competing in the same space and pushing out Domino seats. Interest in Domino was diminishing quickly, and the companies that were using it were trying to get rid of it. I miss the excitement of reading through the red books, and new issues of the yellow technical books that would come out for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606065</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Generative Adversarial Networks" presents a novel framework for generative models, where two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, engage in a game-theoretic process. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates whether data is real or generated. This adversarial approach allows the generator to improve its capacity to create realistic outputs over time, leading to high-quality data generation. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations of this mechanism, its implementation, and the potential applications in fields such as image generation, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised representation learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could quickly wire up one of the LLM APIs as an application-defined function using SQLite if you wanted to play around with the idea of very slow and expensive queries:https://sqlite.org/appfunc.htmlhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/sqlit...Maybe stick with the aggregate variety of function at first if you don't want any billing explosions. I'd probably begin with something like LLM_Summary() and LLM_Classify(). The summary could be an aggregate, and the classify could be a scalar. Being able to write a query like:  SELECT LLM_Summary(Comment)
  FROM Users
  WHERE datetime(Updated_At) &gt;= datetime('now', '-1 day');

Is more expedient than wiring up the equivalent code pile each time. The aggregation method's internals could handle hierarchical summarization, chunking, etc. Or, throw an error back to the user so they are forced to devise a more rational query.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is the implementation https://github.com/dsg-polymtl/flockmtl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll try this at work tomorrow !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616241</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of nullability in programming, particularly in type systems. It highlights the challenges and common pitfalls related to null references, which can lead to runtime errors. The author emphasizes the importance of using type annotations and modifiers to indicate whether a variable can be null. Additionally, the piece provides an overview of different programming languages' approaches to nullability, advocating for strategies that enhance code safety and maintainability. The goal is to promote better coding practices by understanding and managing null values effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612211"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article puts scare quotes around "understand" etc. to try to head off critiques around the lack of precision or scientific language, but I think this is a really good example of where casual use of these terms can get pretty misleading.Because code LLMs have been trained on the syntactic form of the program and not its execution, it's not correct — even if the correlation between variable annotations and requested completions was perfect (which it's not) — to say that the model "understands nullability", because nullability means that under execution the variable in question can become null, which is not a state that it's possible for a model trained only on a million programs' syntax to "understand". You could get the same result if e.g. "Optional" means that the variable becomes poisonous and checking "&gt; 0" is eating it, and "!= None" is an antidote. Human programmers can understand nullability because they've hopefully run programs and understand the semantics of making something null.The paper could use precise, scientific language (e.g. "the presence of nullable annotation tokens correlates to activation of vectors corresponding to, and emission of, null-check tokens with high precision and accuracy") which would help us understand what we can rely on the LLM to do and what we can't. But it seems like there is some subconscious incentive to muddy how people see these models in the hopes that we start ascribing things to them that they aren't capable of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that is exciting in the text is an attempt to go away from describing whether LLM 'understands' which I would argue an ill posed question, but instead rephrase it in terms of something that can actually be measured.It would be good to list a few possible ways of interpreting 'understanding of code'. 
It could possibly include: 
1) Type inference for the result
2) nullability
3) runtime asymptotics
4) What the code does&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There seems to be a typo in OP's "Visualizing Our Results" - but things make perfect sense if red is non-nullable, green is nullable.I'd be really curious to see where the "attention" heads of the LLM look when evaluating the nullability of any given token. Does just it trust the Optional[int] return type signature of the function, or does it also skim through the function contents to understand whether that's correct?It's fascinating to me to think that the senior developer skillset of being able to skim through complicated code, mentally make note of different tokens of interest where assumptions may need to be double-checked, and unravel that cascade of assumptions to track down a bug, is something that LLMs already excel at.Sure, nullability is an example where static type checkers do well, and it makes the article a bit silly on its own... but there are all sorts of assumptions that aren't captured well by type systems. There's been a ton of focus on LLMs for code generation; I think that LLMs for debugging makes for a fascinating frontier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612211</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses philosopher Thomas Nagel's exploration of the concept of "the good" and its implications for ethics and human life. Nagel critiques traditional theories that attempt to define goodness in absolute terms, arguing instead for a more nuanced understanding that considers subjective and objective perspectives. He suggests that recognizing the complexity of human experience can lead to a richer and more meaningful interpretation of ethical living. The piece reflects on the importance of engaging with these philosophical inquiries in contemporary discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how, during the 1980s, software was often downloaded via television signals, a method that may seem outdated today. It discusses the technology behind this practice, notable companies involved, and the impact it had on early computing and software distribution. The piece reflects on the nostalgia of that era, illustrating how television served as a pioneering platform for software access before the internet became prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

The practice ran from about 1999 to 2016. Around 2016, TiVo discontinued support for guide data updates for their first-generation Series1 DVRs. I couldn't find much information about these broadcasts online, though someone did post a clip of one from 2003 [1], there are a few copies of more recent introduction and conclusion animations [2], and there is some information about them on Wikipedia [3].

It's interesting that this post says that where the author lives "someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want".  From other things I read I got the impression that in some (maybe many) cities a reason they're not banned is because they provide revenue, since many are on land like road medians that are controlled by local government.  I'm not sure to what extent the designs themselves are reviewed but the ability to erect a billboard is regulated in such cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Alaska which has a billboard ban. And then I went to Florida for university, and while there was a lot of culture shock I really think that the in your face billboards everywhere where the biggest bit.Huge aggressive grabs for attention when you really should be paying attention to the road really should not be allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606371</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rising competition among airlines to create engaging and memorable safety videos that capture passengers' attention and enhance their safety message. It highlights how traditional safety briefings have evolved into creative productions that often incorporate humor, celebrity appearances, and cultural references. Airlines aim to differentiate themselves in a crowded market by using innovative storytelling techniques to not only inform passengers but also entertain them, ultimately contributing to a more positive flying experience. The piece examines the implications of this trend on passenger compliance and airline branding in an era where consumer attention is increasingly fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently travelled on Ethiopian Airlines, whose safety video is a good mix between the 90s and someone's nephew who know how to edit videos.It very literally showed everything talked about happening inside an actual airplane. Masks actually deploying and dropping from the ceiling and people putting them on, etc.What was interesting for me was, it was the first time I saw _where_ under the seat the life jacket is and it made me realize that despite having watched 100s of these videos I actually never knew how to get the life jacket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite airline safety video of all time is ANA's "Kabuki", which (IMHO) strikes the right elements of being clear, informative, gorgeous, absurd and showcasing Japan all at the same time:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2IZP5NhaKMThey used to have a really good "behind the scenes" video for it as well, but I can only find this shortened version on online:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WCJRyHuXo4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the United video, in many scenes, the more interesting thing is the Rube Goldberg machine distraction, not the actual safety information they're supposed to be conveying.They even do split-screen to add in distraction, when they're trying to show something visually in the less-interesting window.  (Worst lesson ever mis-learned from TikTok.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jep3RR2yEXADid they consciously decide that most people have heard the instructions many times, and the best the airline can hope for is that passengers pause and look up from their personal devices, and maybe subconsciously reactivate those neurons even the slightest bit... as better than nothing?Or did the creatives simply get carried away, and no one reined them in?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43581549</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this has anything to do with using AI for prep. 20 years ago I was interviewing candidates who had lied on their resume, knew some of the things that they'd written about, but had everything fall apart under a little more questioning of what exactly they'd done and why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep coming back to this phrase used in this post: "it was scary".Yeah, hiring is scary. Hiring is insanely expensive on all fronts. Firing people is difficult, it's expensive and legally exposing. Hiring the wrong person, allowing them access your systems and potentially exfiltrate your IP to them is a hazardous but  necessary venture.The thing is, none of these things really changed with AI. People have been lying about their experience for literally centuries. IMO the advent of AI-laden candidates is going to nudge the hiring process back to how we did it 10 years ago, with a good old fashioned face-to-face interview and whiteboard questions. This means a lot of things that we've grown accustomed to in the past 5 years is going to have to melt.- people are probably going to have to fly out for interviews, again.- awkward and/or neurodivergent people are going to have to learn social skills again.- And yeah, you guys, it's time to buy a suit.Companies should consider reverting to forking the upfront $13-1500 dollars for a set of plane tickets for their hiring team and rented conference rooms for a week. It's a whole lot cheaper than spending 50k because you hired the wrong person for half a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The guy had to invent “cool” scenarios because companies think they are Google and working in backend doing normal things won’t get you hired. One could easily have prepared the whole interview with AI without failing to explain details (like what data was being paginated) just by lying a bit more. Not lying on your actual knowledge but on what your previous jobs were about. E.g., I have used k8s in pet projects but not at work, but this job ad for a backend position asks knowledge about k8s, so I’ll put k8s as skill under my last job and invent a credible story that I can talk about based on my experience during my pet projects.I think the message here is: don’t ask for the moon, you are not Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577490</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never understood why they don't let you turn off automatic date parsing. That one feature has caused me more grief than anything else in Excel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, news of the 1582 promulgation had not yet reached the developers of Lotus 1-2-3, so they assumed that 1900 (being a multiple of 4) was a leap year.Joel Spolsky mentions a more charitable take on this from Ed Fries:&gt; Lotus had to fit in 640K. That’s not a lot of memory. If you ignore 1900, you can figure out if a given year is a leap year just by looking to see if the rightmost two bits are zero. That’s really fast and easy. The Lotus guys probably figured it didn’t matter to be wrong for those two months way in the past.https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-rev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one that always bites me is Excel truncating the leading zero in US zip codes (they start with 0 in the Northeast US).  I’m wondering if that would have happened if Microsoft was located in Boston instead of Seattle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571332</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent legislative effort, led by a group of senators, aimed at blocking the implementation of a new AI safety bill. The author, Gary Marcus, analyzes the implications of this attempt, highlighting concerns over the potential risks associated with unregulated AI technologies. He emphasizes the importance of establishing safety measures and regulatory frameworks to mitigate these risks and calls for a thoughtful approach to AI development and deployment. The piece reflects Marcus's advocacy for balancing innovation with public safety in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the assembly rules (if I am understanding them correctly), amendments like that are considered out of order and can be shot down with a majority vote:"92. An amendment to any bill, other than a bill stating legislative
intent to make necessary statutory changes to implement the Budget
Bill, whether reported by a committee or offered by a Member, is not in
order when the amendment relates to a different subject than, is intended
to accomplish a different purpose than, or requires a title essentially
different than, the original bill."http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/rules/assembly_rules.pdfThat being said, it seems that typically nobody in the legislature ever cares to challenge it. I saw it happen for another bill this session too (an AI bill that became something about commercial fishing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something is mysterious?  ... IS corruption mysterious now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;~~This is kinda ridiculous, especially considering the bill wouldn’t even affect OpenAI itself (that would make it an ex post facto law) but just close the loophole for the future.~~ (edit: I misread)I say this as a user of AI, I’ve seen the nonprofit structure get abused way too much for my liking. Not that I have any solutions to the problem though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43607502</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses the concept of variable duty cycle square waves in the context of controlling power to devices. It explains how adjusting the duty cycle of a square wave can modulate the amount of energy delivered, making it a useful approach for applications such as dimming lights or controlling motors. The article delves into the technical details of generating square waves, including circuit design considerations and practical examples of implementation. It emphasizes the flexibility and efficiency that variable duty cycles offer in various electronic projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others noted, merely switching back and forth between -1 and 1 will result in heavy aliasing. Also, since you can only switch from -1 to 1 at integer sample points, you won't be able to accurately generate frequencies that don't divide the sample rate evenly. E.g. if your sample rate is 48 kHz, you won't be able to generate a 50% duty cycle 11 kHz square wave. Either the duty cycle, or the frequency will be different. Like, audibly different.The proper way is either via the Fourier series; or look into BLIT [1] synthesis.[1] https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/blit.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The given examples seem disconnected from the duty cycle radios on my browser.  I mean changing them changes the sound, but it's as if the one I selected is not the one playing.Anyway, what could have been the purpose for the gameboy hardware to provide both 25% and 75% duty cycle?  In audio, these sound identical to a human, no?  They are the same waveform with inverted polarity.  They have the same overtone content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm also working on a gameboy inspired music app! (for Android, in Rust)If you use a perfect square wave, the aliasing is extremely audible and sounds terrible.As far as I can tell, in native everyone uses a nifty algorithm called bank-limited audio synthesis, and specifically blargg's implementation blip_buf.https://slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/If I were OP I'd try to compile the rust port of this library to WASM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613180</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;Apache ECharts is an open-source visualization tool that enables users to create interactive and customizable charts and graphs for data representation. The platform offers a variety of chart types, including line, bar, pie, scatter, and more, with extensive features for data analysis and interactive capabilities. It provides detailed documentation, examples, and tutorials to help users integrate ECharts into their projects, making it suitable for web developers and data analysts looking for powerful visualization solutions. Additionally, it supports responsive design and is highly adaptable for different data-driven applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've tested almost every visualization library under the sun when building Briefer (https://briefer.cloud) and I can confidently say that Apache ECharts is the best.The main issues with other libraries is that they're either:(a) ugly
(b) difficult to use (i.e. having to do things imperatively)
(c) not flexible enoughApache ECharts solve these 3 problems. It's pretty by default, it allows us to mount/calculate the declarative spec for the graphs in the back-end and then only send the desired spec to the front-end so it can render, and it's also extremely flexible to the point we can support everything that traditional BI tools can do.We've never had to extend the lib to do anything new, everything we need is already there.Glad to see this great piece of work on top of HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll toss some props to `go-echarts` [1], which allows you to declare charts with Golang types and it all gets bound to JSON automagically by Golang's JSON marshaller.  I've used it for many projects and whenever there's an issue/PR, the maintainer responds quickly.It's fun to Go-embed JavaScript functions and SQL queries, for this weird blend of data, SQL, Go and Javascript.  Here's a Golang example that pulls data from a DuckDB and creates a baked-in candlestick chart file with JavaScript tooltips. [2][1] https://github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts[2] https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-duckduck-goose/blob/mai...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECharts is in my opinion the best out there. It surprisingly doesn't come up in a lot of lists or search for charting libraries. I've tried them all: chart.js, google charts, amCharts, Highcharts, ApexCharts. We use it in our tool/library https://docs.chartsql.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624220</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a before/after moment for image generation. A simple example is the background images on a ton of (mediocre) music youtube channels. They almost all use AI generated images that are full of nonsense the closer you look. Jazz channels will feature coffee shops with garbled text on the menu and furniture blending together. I bet all of that disappears over the next few months.On another note, and perhaps others are feeling similarly, but I am finding myself surprised at how little use I have for this stuff, LLMs included. If, ten years ago, you told me I would have access to tools like this, I'm sure I would have responded with a never ending stream of ideas and excitement. But now that they're here, I just sort of poke at it for a minute and carry on with my day.Maybe it's the unreliability on all fronts, I don't know. I ask a lot of programming questions and appreciate some of the autocomplete in vscode, but I know I'm not anywhere close to taking full advantage of what these systems can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is circumstantial evidence out there that 4o image manipulation isn't done within the 4o image generator in one shot but is a workflow done by an agentic system. Meaning this, user inputs prompt "create an image with no elephants in the room" &gt; prompt goes to an llm which preprocesses the human prompt &gt; outputs a a prompt that it knows works withing this image generator well &gt; create an image of a room &gt; and that llm processed prompt is sent to the image generator.  Same happens with edits but a lot more complicated, meaning function calling tools are involved with many layers of edits being done behind the scenes.  Try it yourself, take an image, send it it, and have the 4o edit it for you in some way, then ask it to edit again, and again, and so on.  you will notice noticeable sepia filter being applied every edit, and the image ends up more and more sepia toned with more edits.  This is because in the workflow that is one of the steps that is naively applied without consideration of multi edit possibility.  If this was a one shot solution where editing is done within 4o image model by itself, the sepia problem wouldn't be there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the example where the coffee table is swapped, I notice every time the image is reprocessed it mutates, based on the previous iteration, and objects become more bizarre each time, like chinese whispers.* The weird-ass basket decoration on the table originally has some big chain links (maybe anchor chain, to keep the theme with the beach painting). By the third version, they're leathery and are merging with the basket.* The candelabra light on the wall, with branch decorations, turns into a sort of skinny minimalist gold stag head, and then just a branch.* The small table in the background gradually loses one of its three legs, and ends up defying gravity.* The freaky green lamps in the window become at first more regular, then turn into topiary.* Making the carpet less faded turns up the saturation on everything else, too, including the wood the table is made from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43590569</guid></item><item><title>3.

The puzzle is to get all the answers. If you figure out an outer answer earlier, that acts as a clue for an inner answer, just as inner answers act as clues for outer answers. A crossword isn't speedrun by just filling in the bottom-rightmost word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really fun and clever! Super super creative. Congratulations!! I just love it when somebody comes up with a new idea like this, it's inspiring.My only nitpick: I totally get that you have to solve the inner clues before solving an outer clue, and that outer clues can help you solve an inner clue.BUT, the ergonomics/UX of that is just impossible... There was an inner clue that was super-stumping me, and I could solve "downwards" from like 5 clues above, but trying to keep track of which brackets were which and which level was which was maddening.It really feels like it needs a way to answer outer clues even if it won't collapse them. Just to keep track of them. And then a better way of tracking so many levels of nesting. I don't know if the answer is indented nesting like in code, or what. But the current UX only effectively allows you to work inside-out, when outside-in is clearly a necessary piece of the puzzle, because sometimes you get inner clues that are just stumpers that you have no other way of figuring out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622719</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government-run payments system has surged in popularity, overshadowing traditional banking methods and private companies. The system, designed to facilitate rapid and secure transactions, has significantly improved financial inclusion by allowing more citizens access to banking services. It challenges established financial institutions, raising concerns about competition and regulatory oversight. The article discusses the implications of this shift for Brazil’s economy and the broader financial landscape in Latin America, highlighting the potential benefits and risks of a state-dominated payments ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been living in Brazil for the last 20 years.Pix revolutionised the way we transact in Brazil. I've used Pix to pay for things that cost only cents, and I have a friend who bought her house using Pix.  The system just works for any transfer amount. And it's so easy to use.Its speed is truly baffling, and so is its reliability. Never have I failed to make a Pix payment because of downtime. I never cease to be amazed by how fast money arrives in my Brazilian account when I make a withdrawal directly from my EUR wallet on Wise. I receive a push notification from my Brazilian bank before Wise finishes running the animation of confirmation of withdrawal. It's like magic.And it's so widespread that nowadays I don't even question whether someone accepts Pix. When I get in a taxi, no matter how old the driver is, it's certain that they take (and prefer) Pix.I've even had homeless people ask me for Pix instead of change on multiple occasions.Cryptocurrencies don't stand a chance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm thinking, maybe controversially, centralized national payment service like this should be government-run based on my experience with Alipay which is a digital payment service in China.Due to it's commercial origin, Alipay is filled with unwanted ads and traps. Almost every time I made a payment with it, a pop up prompts me to enlist their Ant Financial LOAN service either now, or being prompted for the same question again 30 days later (yep, not Yes or No, but Now or Later). It's just fucking ridiculous, I don't need a LOAN for a $400 projector, and I don't need a LOAN for a $4 hair cut (Xi should probably do something about it, really).I'm glad that at least people of Brazil don't have to suffer that kind of shit. At least their government-run program is better scrutinized and boring, thus more dependable, that's a good thing in my eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Pix has spiced up Brazil’s fusty banking sector, but it gives the central bank a worrying amount of powerI think a largely prefer a government-run payment system than an US company monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620279</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research indicating that complex intelligence has evolved independently at least twice among vertebrate animals. It highlights two distinct lineages: one in mammals, particularly primates, and another in birds, notably corvids and parrots. The study emphasizes the evolutionary adaptations that led to enhanced cognitive abilities in these groups, driven by social living and environmental challenges. It also examines the implications of this dual evolution of intelligence for understanding the nature of cognition and the brain across different species.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting to think of how bird intelligence is related to their perspective. Perching high in branches and taking to the skies allows them to see a large overview of the many activities of other life forms. They can manage to get relatively safe vantage points and just watch. The better they get at predicting what the low animals on the surface are doing, the more opportunities that they have to sneak in and sneak out safely to get a meal. Being stuck on the surface as a mammal means a more immediate, limited-scope, fight-or-flight reaction dominates daily activities, versus a game-board view of many interactions.Bird intelligence makes a lot more sense in that context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm guessing the reason birds' brains are so much smaller for a given level of intelligence is that there is so much more evolutionary pressure to make things lighter when you need to be able to fly. Mammals are likely more optimized for resilience and less caloric expenditure instead of weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus octopi, which evolved some degree of intelligence in a very different way than vertebrates. So we have at least three paths to intelligence now.This is an indication that fᵢ in the Drake Equation [1] is probably closer to 1 than 0.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619548</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a fan of TS and have been a paying customer for work infra for almost a year now. It really is well put together and easy to use, but I do run up against some issues/complaints when diving deep that I hope they can work out:* The pricing tiers and included features by tier penalizes you in frustrating ways. The base plan is a reasonable $6/user/m, but if you want to use ACLs to control anything in a workable way, it jumps 3x to $18/u/m. Better solutions are available for that kind of money, and I shudder to imagine what the next tier ('call us') costs.* Subnet routing broke on Ubuntu (maybe other distros) recently, and there were no alerts, communication from TS, or TS tools to pinpoint/figure out what was going on. I stumbled on a solution (install subnet router on a Windows box), and from there I searched and found others with that issue. Lost half a day in emergency mode over that!* Better tooling to determine why it's falling back to DERP instead of direct for remote clients. DERP relays should be an absolute last resort to provide connectivity for Business-plan-level customers (very slow), and the way TS works just assumes any connectivity is fine.Overall, the simplicity and abstraction of complex VPN networking is wonderful, but if you have issues or advanced needs, you are immediately thrust into the low-level UDP/NAT/STUN world you were trying to avoid. At that point, you're better off using a traditional VPN (WG, OpenVPN, or heaven forbid, IPSec), because it ends up being more straightforward (not easier) without the abstractions and easy-button stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got conflicted feels about Tailscale. I love their product and a bunch of the people I know use their free tier, including myself.But their enterprise strategy destroys their good will. I can only assume it's focused on killing old school VPN products. The free tier that we love is a marketing expense. And it’s not even a conversion play.People are complaining about ~10/user/month -- add basic things that you'd need to manage more than 10 peeps (SAML/SCIM support) and you're talking ~20/user/month. For us, a small sub 200 person company, they immediately lost their chance. We have lots of problems in the security space, some we're willing to spend more than 20/user/month to solve. Legacy network access is not one of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I saw the new round, I was instantly worried about change in direction that will most likely come with this, and effectively drive away regular users from a tool that seems universally loved.Similar sentiment can be seen in the discussion from three years ago [1] when they raised $100M.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31259950&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620141</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how any program can be utilized as a shell for GitHub Actions by leveraging the capabilities of the `run` keyword within the YAML configuration files. It provides examples and insights on customizing workflows and enhancing automation by replacing the default shell with various programming languages or tools. The author emphasizes the flexibility this approach offers, allowing developers to tailor their CI/CD processes to their specific needs and preferences, ultimately leading to more efficient development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used this in the past to force bash to print every command it runs (using the -x flag) in the Actions workflow. This can be very helpful for debugging.https://github.com/jstrieb/just.sh/blob/2da1e2a3bfb51d583be0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One cool undocumented GitHub Actions trick I spotted at work was the ability to use wildcards to match repository_dispatch event names:    on:
      repository_dispatch:
        - security_scan
        - security_scan::*

Why would you want to do this?We centralize our release pipelines as it's the only way to force repositories through a defined reusable workflow (we don't want our product teams to have to maintain them).This allows us to dispatch an event like so:    {
      "event_type": "security_scan::$product_name::$version",
      "client_payload": {
        "field": "value"
      }
    }

Then it is far easier to identify which product and version a workflow is running when looking in the Actions tab of our central release repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience is that the less done in GitHub actions the better.I tend to prefer either:- Using a build-system (e.g. Make) to encode logic and just invoke that from GitHub Actions; or- Writing a small CLI program and then invoke that from GitHub ActionsIt's so much easier to debug this stuff locally than in CI.So an interesting trick, but I don't see where it would be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617493</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On ABZÛ we ripped out multiplayer and lots of other cruft from AActor and UPrimitiveComponent - dropping builtin overlap events, which are a kind of anti pattern anyway, not only saved RAM but cut a lot of ghost reads/writes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was true even in the first version over 20 years ago.
In a single player derivative, I remember combing through tons of UScript, unrealscript, stanzas which went something like. "Do this, and if we're in multiplayer, do this too or instead."
The code was a messs, but again, good times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting analysis of where the data lives… cutting 3-4 textures would save you more memory even in the 100k actor case, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600363</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a funny conversation with a friend of mine recently who told me about how he's in the middle of his yearly review cycle, and management is strongly encouraging him and his team to make greater use of AI tools. He works in biomedical lab research and has absolutely no use for LLMs, but everyone on his team had a great time using the corporate language model to help write amusing resignation letters as various personalities, pirate resignation, dinosaur resignation etc. I dont think anyone actually quit, but what a great way to absolutely nuke team moral!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always been the kind of developer that aims to have more red lines than green ones in my diffs. I like writing libraries so we can create hundreds of integration tests declaratively. I’m the kind of developer that disappears for two days and comes back with a 10x speedup because I found two loop variables that should be switched.There is no place for me in this environment. I’d not that I couldn’t use the tools to make so much code, it’s that AI use makes the metric for success speed-to-production. The solution to bad code is more code. AI will never produce a deletion. Publish or perish has come for us and it’s sad. It makes me feel old just like my Python programming made the mainframe people feel old. I wonder what will make the AI developers feel old…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”I recently played through a game and after finishing it, read over the reviews.There was a brief period after launch where the game was heavily criticised for its use of AI assets. They removed some, but apparently not all (or more likely, people considered the game tainted and started claiming everything was AI)The (I believe) 4 person dev team used AI tools to keep up with the vast quantity of art they needed to produce for what was a very art heavy game.I can understand people with an existing method not wanting to change. And AI may not actually be a good fit for a lot of this stuff. But I feel like the real winners are going to be the people who do a lot more with a lot less out of sheer necessity to meet outrageous goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619759</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  See, I know that shipping end-user software - like the Tailwind compiler - if that software is written in an interpreted language - is fucking hard.This I don't get. This is interpreted code, most web backends integrate node, why not just ship a node module? Why in gods name ship bun.The whole web development scene has had some of the worst software engineering I've ever seen. With the exception of the Ruby scene, we have Tilt and Nokogiri for these types of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was hesitant to give tailwind a try, like most aging web developers I couldn't stand that it breaks the "cascading" part of CSS.But eventually I didn't have choice as I inherited a web app that has all of the newfangled build components that web apps come with.  I love that we're coming full circle back to MVC with server components.After getting used to it, I ended up liking Tailwind, mostly because it breaks the cascading part of CSS.  There are so many unique parts to webpages these days that I think it makes sense to keep the styles close to their components, as opposed to global cascading components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got a number of vanilla JS, HTML, CSS libraries that work only from within the browser, using the standard tags to include them.For me, not having a build-step means that, yes, I miss out on typescript, but the upsides are easier to read, easier debugging and lower cognitive burden during both writing and reading the application.It means I will never, like the author in the article, spend $X weeks, and then spend a further $Y dollars just to build something "modern".My "modern looking" applications are developed, and then tested, on a machine from 2010 (1st-gen i7) that has 16GB of RAM and oodles of slow spinning-rust disks, and it isn't painful at all.[1][1] It is, in fact, quite nice when I see a client use their system from their own PC and it's just a little bit snappier than I am used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615986</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of "Frankenstein laptops" in India, where tech enthusiasts and repair shops piece together usable laptops from discarded or broken parts. This trend highlights the challenges faced by many in India regarding access to affordable technology and the growing culture of electronics recycling and upcycling. It showcases the ingenuity of users who manage to create functional machines that meet their needs despite financial constraints, reflecting broader themes of sustainability and self-sufficiency in technology use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During my middle school days, we lived in a small town for a little while (read: A place where i was allowed to take my bicycle out onto the main road).After school, I used to spend a lot of time just hanging out around some TV and radio repair shops and just watched them work. They used to be friendly and gave me parts like spare motors, lights that were lying around from broken Walkmans they wouldn't repair. I took those motors and added to my bicycle as a "dynamo light" , built "wired RC car" etc ...Fast forward to a few years ago when i got into building racing drones, soldering certain tiny wires was difficult for me. I went to a nearby mobile repair shop to get that done and he was happy to help me out.I owe a lot of my curiosity and my knowledge today to these repair shops.It's not a good thing that our electronics are becoming less and less repairable these days. No wonder these repair shops are vanishing as the time progresses.The closest thing to that we have these days are makerspaces. At our local makerspace we encourage people try to fix their broken electronics instead of throwing them away. But I feel like there should be more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago, I wanted to add more RAM to a Lenovo laptop. I opened the thing, remove the RAM, and like a complete idiot, switched on the power without any RAM in the slot.The laptop refused to start.I took it to the Lenovo center and they said about 7-10 days and a minimum of Rs 10,000 (about $150 in those days).Since this was too much for an old laptop, I looked for alternatives. Someone suggested a repair shop in Nehru Place, New DelhiThis was tucked into the back of the basement of a big tower. A tiny 10x10 room filled with laptop partsThe guy at the counter looked at the laptop, opened it up, twisted some wires around, added another few wires, and the thing was working againTotal time: under 10 minutes.Total cost: Rs 200 - just about $2.5 today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's simple, the labour cost for repair is lower than the replacement cost, we also have people scavenging for valuables in landfills. As/When India will become rich enough, this will become uneconomical. Long term solution is to force companies to build products with repairability in mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618105</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "CYC," which refers to a large-scale project aimed at establishing a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that enables computers to understand and reason about the world like humans. It examines the history, goals, and methodologies of the CYC project, highlighting its significance in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. The author critically assesses the challenges faced by CYC, including its complexity and the evolving nature of knowledge, while emphasizing its potential impact on the future of AI and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had the funny thought that this is exactly what a sentient AI would write "stop looking here, there is nothing to see, move along." :-)I (like vannevar apparently) didn't feel Cyc was going anywhere useful, there were ideas there, but not coherent enough to form a credible basis for even a hypothesis of how a system could be constructed that would embody them.I was pretty impressed by McCarthy's blocks world demo, later he and a student formalized some of the rules for creating 'context'[1] for AI to operate within, I continue to think that will be crucial to solving some of the mess that LLMs create.For example, the early failures of LLMs suggesting that you could make salad crunchy by adding rocks was a classic context failure, data from the context of 'humor' and data from the context of 'recipes' intertwined. Because existing models have no context during training, there is nothing in the model that 'tunes' the output based on context. And you get rocks in your salad.[1] https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;d...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if it's possible to design a new formal language (something like lojban [1], with a grammar strictly based on formal logic) but with better UX so that it can be used by regular folks like me? Maybe combine something like Attempto [2] with a dedicated visual UI?I would think a language like that could speed up knowledge base construction. Maybe it can also serve as a substitute for natural languages in some situations where we want our communication to be logically airtight.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempto_Controlled_EnglishOn a separate note, I've always wondered how Cyc is pronounced. Is it "sike", or is it "see-why-see"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very interesting and worthwhile article (better than the comments here would suggest). However, I find it a bit of a pity that the author places so much emphasis on the assumption that the project has failed. The approach has not simply failed because the search for a solution has been going on for forty years. It took even more than forty years and costed at least as much before neural networks became really useful, and nobody would claim that the project failed because of that. And today's LLM are not really that intelligent yet. Maybe Cycorp's knowledge base will be made generally accessible at some point, so that it can be used to train LLMs. Perhaps then a greater benefit of this data will become apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625474</guid></item><item><title>13.

Then it made headlines again when analysis revealed it was a fake.Not saying this knife will turn out to be a fake but seeing "Experts will soon conduct a metallurgical analysis" makes me just that little bit hesitant.1) https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vast/unikt-jarnaldershalsb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the press in Poland wrote about this, I'll add a little context. According to the Muzeum Historii Ziemi Kamieńskiej's spokesperson, the knife is actually up to 3-2,8. They used the X-ray fluorescence method to come up with that number. The dating is being disputed, as it was rushed out after the discovery, and it's not like you can use carbon dating on metal. There's still chemical analysis to be done, but that doesn't give accurate results either. Some scientists point to the XVIII-XIX CE. Apparently some experts had a look at it and say it's from the Middle East, and if made of brass it could mean it's from I BCE, and it's been stylized to look ancient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a question. Who gets to own the dagger? The museum? Or the people who found it? What the general law around finding things like this and ownership?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615925</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of the CSS `text-wrap: pretty;` feature in WebKit, which enhances typography by improving how text wraps around other elements. This feature aims to create more visually appealing layouts by allowing text to flow smoothly around images and other content without breaking words awkwardly. It encourages designers to adopt this new option for a more refined and polished reading experience, highlighting the technical details and potential applications of the feature in modern web design.&lt;/p&gt;

I just can't bring myself to believe there is a meaningfully sized group of developers that have considered the performance of text-wrapping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m pretty excited for this to be added to ereaders, which notoriously (among people who care about this kind of thing) have terrible layout engines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Far to little effort and attention has been devoted to creating beautiful text online. The web set text back centuries. In some ways it was never this bad except for the monospaced typewriters.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search is primarily a portal - you know a particular resource exists, you just don't know its exact URL.You hear about this new programming language called "Frob", and you assume it must have a website. So you google "Frob language". You hear that there was a plane crash in DC, and assume (CNN/AP/your_favorite_news_site) has almost certainly written an article about it. You google "DC plane crash."LLMs aren't ever going to replace search for that use case, simply because they're never going to be as convenient.Where LLMs will take over from search is when it comes to open-ended research - where you don't know in advance where you're going or what you're going to find. I don't really have frequent use cases of this sort, but depending on your occupation it might revolutionize your daily work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still prefer tranditional search engines over LLMs but I admit, its results feels worse than it has traditionally.I don't like LLMs for two reasons:* I can't really get a feel for the veracity of the information without double checking it. A lot of context I get from just reading results from a traditional search engine is lost when I get an answer from a LLM. I find it somewhat uncomfortable to just accept the answer, and if I have to double check it anyways, the LLM's answer is kind of meaningless and I might as well use a traditional search engine.* I'm missing out on learning opertunities that I would usually get otherwise by reading or skimming through a larger document trying to find the answer. I appreciate that I skim through a lot of documentation on a regular basis and can recall things that I just happened to read when looking for a solution for another problem. I would hate it if an LLM would drop random tidbits of information when I was looking for concrete answers, but since its a side effect of my information gathering process, I like it.If I were to use an AI assistant that could help me search and curate the results, instead of trying to answer my question directly. Hopefully in a more sleek way than Perplexity does with its sources feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People keep saying this but I keep using Google and I keep being happy with my results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619768</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Master's supervisor, at Wits university in Johannesburg, worked on the architecture of the 360 after graduating from the PhD program at Harvard. I remember him telling us how they went about deciding whether or not 32 bits would be a sufficient size for "most" floating point numbers. They were very systematic about it, scouring journals, talking with physicists and mathematicians and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL that not only the software side was chaotic (served as the backdrop of Fred Brook's "Mythical Man Month"), but also the hardware side almost failed.the article here ends around 1971 --- the mainframe would later save IBM again, twice, once when they replaced aluminum with copper in interconnects, and then when some crazy IBM Fellow had a team port Linux to s390.  Which marked the birth of "enterprise Linux", i.e. Linux running the data centre, for real.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This whole thing is very cool and worth reading.BUT. I worked at a place that used IBM 360s. We ran stuff for engineers, a lot of Fortran along with assembly code. We had so much stuff going on we could not code up and run things fast enough. The engineer/scientist got frustrated.Then one day an engineer brought in an Apple II from home and ran the programs on that.The earth shook. The very ground beneath us moved. Tectonic plates shifted. The world was never the same again! I think it was Visicalc.Later there were other things. Soul Of A New Machine. The Mac.I wonder how the compute power of a current high end smart phone compares with and IBM 360? I know the graphics chip is better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619229</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The project "coroot" on GitHub focuses on providing a comprehensive and user-friendly observability tool for cloud-native applications. It integrates metrics, logs, and traces to help developers and operators better understand application performance, troubleshoot issues, and enhance overall reliability. Key features include automated dependencyGraph visualizations, insights into performance bottlenecks, and real-time monitoring capabilities. The project's aim is to facilitate easier debugging and optimization of microservices architectures while promoting best practices in observability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great work! It's nice seeing another observability tool. Demo is neat and easy to navigate.Couple of questions:What's the overhead of tracing + logging observed by users? I see many tools being built on top of the OpenTelemetry eBPF tracer, which is nice to see.The OpenTelemetry eBPF tracer uses sampling to capture traces. Do other types of logging in the tool use sampling as well (HTTP traces)?When finding SLO violations, can this tool find the bug if the latency spikes do not happen frequently (ie, latency spikes happens every 5minutes - 1hour)? I'm curious if the team have had experienced such events and even if those pmax latencies matter to customers since it may not happen frequently.I see that the flamegraph is a CPU flamegraph - does off-cpu sampling matter (Disk/Network, etc...)? Or does the CPU flamegraph provide enough for developers to solve the issue?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked into eBPF-based observability tools for k8s some time ago and found at least four tools that look incredibly similar: Pixie, Parca, Coroot, and Odigos. There are probably others I missed too. Do you have any thoughts about this?From a user perspective, having several tools that overlap heavily but differ in subtle ways makes evaluation and adoption harder. It feels like if any two of these projects consolidated, they’d have a good shot at becoming the "default" eBPF observability solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a cursory look and I like what I see – the service maps are really good, I love the level of detail. I will say, one thing I'm looking for with this kind of software, to maximise value, is structured logging support, and from what I could see, each log line just has the raw payload currently. Is that something you have on your roadmap?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43623820</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fundamentals of analytic combinatorics, focusing on a specific example to illustrate key concepts and techniques. It explains how generating functions can be utilized to analyze combinatorial structures, highlighting the connection between combinatorial objects and their generating functions. The author provides a detailed breakdown of the example, demonstrating methods to derive asymptotic estimates and analyze combinatorial growth rates, ultimately showcasing the power of analytic combinatorics in solving complex counting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is only tangentially related, but one thing that I am still kind of hopeful about is analytic combinatorics will free us from the tyranny of asymptotic analysis.I suppose this is kind of a hot take, and in some ways less relevant than it was (say) 10 years ago, but I believe the theoretical CS community has spent a lot of time analyzing the performance of various algorithms over the years and kind of pointedly not inventing algorithms which accomplish some result at all, even if it is only known to be computable in a pathologically inefficient way. This means a lot of breakthroughs that could have been TCS breakthroughs have been invented, usually worse, by other communities.I am not the only one who thinks so, here[1] is an obscure talk where Michael Mitzenmacher (a well-known CS theory prof at Harvard) makes more or less this specific complaint.One of the nice things about Flajolet/Sedgewick[2] (mentioned in this post) is that it gives a nice set of combinators for (at least it seems to me, in theory) precisely enumerating how many "steps" an algorithm would take given some input. I optimistically imagine a world where we replace the relatively non-specific asymptotic bounds of an algorithm with a very specific quantification of the work an algorithm will take. And that this in turn would free TCS to focus on things that are more germane to the field as a whole.With that all said I'm open to the argument that TCS has fundamentally changed and this is no longer such a big issue. But perusing the various TCS conferences I sense it isn't.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3anjSAnKBo[2]: https://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/book.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool!What's meant by "it’s already too much to ask for a closed form for fibonacci numbers"? Binet's formula is usually called a closed form in my experience. Is "closed form" here supposed to mean "closed form we can evaluate without needing arbitrary-precision arithmetic"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What math lets you most easily be convinced you’ve come up with the right answer when you actually haven’t?Seems like combinatorics comes in second only to statistics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624293</guid></item><item><title>20.

I never used much IBM hardware, and always assumed that their terminals used EBCDIC and not ASCII.The HP 2648A terminal also had a "block mode", and the RTE screen editor used it.  It was one of the first screen editors I ever used (in 1984).  (I had used WordStar on CP/M as early as 1979.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIChttps://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/HP_2648Ahttp://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/hp/1000/RTE-A/92077-90039_RTE-A...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool!As someone who wishes more people got some programming exposure to IBM z and how it works differently than minicomputer derived operating systems (both *nix and Windows count here), I think this is awesome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We connected our two IBM 4381s (VM/CMS) to our BT mega/kilostream serial network using VT200 (and VT00 &amp; VT52)-emulating  terminals via an IBM 7171 protocol converter. I had the somewhat unenviable task of programming this beast, but it worked well enough, and (like all IBM gear) was very well documented. This would be mid-1980s. The 7171 was good because it meant we didn't have to replace all our terminals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43621007</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Netflix uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to accurately attribute network flow logs for performance monitoring and troubleshooting. It highlights the challenges in identifying and analyzing data flow within their infrastructure and explains the implementation of eBPF to enhance observability. By utilizing eBPF, Netflix can collect detailed performance metrics and identify issues more efficiently, ultimately improving their streaming service's reliability and user experience. The piece emphasizes the importance of this technology in managing complex network environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Coroot, we solve the same problem, but in a slightly different way. The traffic source is always a container (Kubernetes pod, systemd slice, etc.). The destination is initially identified as an IP:PORT pair, which, in the case of Kubernetes services, is often not the final destination. To address this, our agent also determines the actual destination by accessing the conntrack table at the eBPF level. Then, at the UI level, we match the actual destination with metadata about TCP listening sockets, effectively converting raw connections into container-to-container communications.The agent repo: https://github.com/coroot/coroot-node-agent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question to the Netflix folks: I saw a lot of in-house developed tools being quoted, do you guys have service mesh like linkerd ?Have you guys evaluated vendors like Kentik?I would love to get more insight into what do you guys actually do with flow logs? for example if I store 1 TB of flow logs, what value can I actually derive from them that justify the cost of collection, processing, and storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it necessary to rely on ip address attribution?  If FlowExporter uses ebpf and tcp tracepoints, could each workloads be placed in its own cgroup and could FlowExporter directly introspect which cgroup (and thus, workload) a given tcp socket event should be attributed to?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624888</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where x is the final hidden layer of the base model, the idea here is to steer outputs in some direction by adding a vector y. More specifically, y is an exponential moving average over a sequence of vectors W(z_t), where z_t are some sort of context vectors and W is a linear map.Except, the linear map W is just set to a random initialization, so it won't work for obvious reasons in its current form. (I guess this is why there is no example of its output. I'm guessing it was vibe-coded?) Also, since the intervention is only happening at the last hidden layer, I can't imagine this would really change how the model "thinks" in an interesting way. Like, yeah, you can absolutely make a model talk about dogs by adding in control vector for "dogness" somewhere.Basically, this method is "inspired by graffiti art of tagging and the neuroplastic nature of living brains" in the same way that taking an exponential moving average of a time series would be "informed by state-space dynamics techniques utilized in deep learning, reservoir computing, and quantum mechanics." Really tired of the amount of insincere/pointless language in deep learning nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Played with the demo a bit and I got confused.1. The chat context is always provided, and that introduces a bit of uncertainty - when the chat history mentioned something the model is always inclined to connect with it.2. When I tried to set each context to an empty string, the model doesn't show any evidence of remembering concepts. I told it 5 times that I love cats, and when asked about its favorite animal, its output remains "honeybee" and "octopus".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, somebody reinvented control vectors.This industry needs to stop reinventing things every 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618339</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! This guy is using the fancy new treelist [1] package which implements RRB trees. These are super cool data structures: a cache-friendly, multiway tree structure to store a sorted collection with O(log_{32} n) read, functional insert/update/append/prepend. Really a fantastic data structure for functional programming.[1]: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/treelist.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mathy construction like in the article is probably important for the full conjecture, but isn't this concrete case just an instance of the bin-covering problem? Your discrete items are the log of each prime factor (included according to its multiplicity), set the lower threshold to log(100k), and if you get any solution with 300k or more factors, you can redistribute the extra factors arbitrarily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like how Tao put out the call, and you answered it. Very cool! I was waiting for someone on here with engineering and math chops to attempt devising a more efficient approach teased in that article. Super cool to see you do it!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I keep seeing people advocating that the idea that we should build everything, and every piece or everything, here is a good one. Why? Is this just an isolationist dream? The reductive, absurd, extreme of this is why don't individual people go out and build all their own stuff like cars and houses. Let's all go out and learn how to mine and refine metal ore so we can get started on building the family sedan! There is an argument for what the right balance is, and likely a good argument that at lest some minor capability should exist so we can keep re-assessing the value of that industry, but the notion that we should have it all in-house will just limit us to much more primitive tech since we can't gain the benefit of world wide innovation and build off of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And that's 30 years ago. It's worse now.The US isn't producing much manufacturing machinery.Machine tools last a long time, many decades. Replacement of worn-out machine tools does happen, but slowly. Because of this, the market for new machine tools is mostly driven by the growth rate of manufacturing, not the total level of manufacturing activity. If manufacturing is flat or in decline, new machine tool sales become rare. The US does have a big used machine tool market, and much demand is filled from there.China now makes quite good machine tools. (Plus many crappy ones.) Search Alibaba for "CNC mill". There are decent 3-axis machines below US$20,000, and 5-axis machines below $30,000. Haas, the biggest machine tool builder in the Western world, has almost nothing below $70,000.[1]As a rule of thumb, 10x the volume cuts manufactured product cost in half. It's hard to come back from being a small volume producer.[1] https://www.haascnc.com/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How’s basing the US economy on services looking now?My brother is an extremely skilled machinist, the sort who could build machine tools if he had the resources. And let me tell you there ain’t many of them, especially not young ones. Why? Because the US has emphasized college as the only respectable education path, as well as the only path to well paid jobs. That’s how you end up with a manufacturing industry full of lazy knuckleheads (and believe me I’ve got the stories to back this assertion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43588337</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "the uncanny valley" in artificial intelligence and robotics, which refers to the discomfort or eeriness that people feel when encountering humanoid robots that are almost but not quite lifelike. It explores the psychological implications of this phenomenon, the reasons behind our reactions to near-humans, and how it impacts the development of AI and robotics. The author analyzes various examples and offers insights into the design choices that can help mitigate the uncanny valley effect, ultimately aiming for a more acceptable interaction between humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;

Talk about how you can reframe a "real world" problem in terms of some puzzles we may have played as kids.  Invite us to play more as adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if anyone wants a "human" solution1) there are 4 questions that everyone answered the same way (let's say this earned everyone A points)2) in the rest of the questions, 7-point and 5-point students gave opposite answersthat means that 7-A (rest of 7-point student's correct answers) equals to 5-(4-A) (rest of 5-point student's incorrect answers)7-A = 1+A =&gt; A=3That means 3-point student scored 3 points together with everyone else, and answered rest of the questions wrongFrom this it's trivial to find the hidden score and why there are 4 possible answer keys&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625452</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by dicroce focuses on HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs, which are used for efficient nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The project includes an implementation of the HNSW algorithm, showcasing its effectiveness for large-scale data and offering features like customizable parameters to optimize performance. The repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and detailed documentation for developers interested in utilizing HNSW in their applications. Overall, it serves as a resource for those looking to implement or learn more about this advanced search algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, HSNWs are not so complex, and they work great. I wrote an implementation myself, it's 2500 lines of code (5x the one of dicroce!), but inside there is binary and int8 quantization and many advanced features (include true deletions), and I commented it as much as possible. I hope you may find it useful to read alongside the one proposed by OP:https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/modules/vector-...Still, to be honest, I'm reading the 500 lines of code with great interest because I didn't thought it was possible to go so small, maybe part of the trick is that's in C++ and not in C, as for instance you don't have the queue code.Also the strategy used by my implementation in order to re-link the orphaned nodes upon deletion adds complexity, too. (btw any feedback on that part is especially appreciated)EDIT: Ok after carefully inspection this makes more sense :D1. Yes, C++ helps, the vector class, the priority queue, ...2. I forgot to say that I implemented serialization other than quantization, and this also includes quite some code.3. Support for threads is another complexity / code-size price to pay.And so forth. Ok, now it makes a lot of sense. Probably the 500 LOC implementation is a better first-exposure experience for newcomers. After accumulating all the "but how to..." questions, maybe my C implementation is a useful read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I particularly appreciated the concise and plain explanation of the data-structure, it really demystifies it.&gt; HNSW is a graph structure that consists of levels that are more sparsely populated at the top and more densely populated at the bottom. Nodes within a layer have connections to other nodes that are near them on the same level. When a node is inserted a random level is picked and the node is inserted there. It is also inserted into all levels beneath that level down to 0.&gt; When searches arrive they start at the top and search that level (following connections) until they find the closest node in the top level. The search then descends and keeps searching nearby nodes. As the search progresses the code keeps track of the K nearest nodes it has seen. Eventually it either finds the value OR it finds the closest value on level 0 and the K nearest nodes seen are returned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implementations like these are incredibly useful for understanding how something like HNSW works, and being able to make derivative work.I put together a tiny little implementation a while ago, the key thing being, it writes the index as a few parquet files, so you can host the index on a CDN and read from it via http range requests (e.g. via duckdb wasm).Definitely isn't beating any benchmarks, but free (or wildly cheap) to host, as you serve it directly from a CDN and processing is done locally.https://github.com/jasonjmcghee/portable-hnsw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43623099</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Meta has introduced its new AI model, LLaMA 4, which aims to improve gaming experiences through advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. The model is designed to enhance NPC (non-player character) interactions and game environments, contributing to more immersive and dynamic gameplay.

The model doesn't look great. All the coverage I've seen has been negative.This is about what I expected, but it makes you wonder what they're going to do next. At this point it looks like they are falling behind the other open models, and made an ambitious bet on MoEs, without this paying off.Did Zuck push for the release? I'm sure they knew it wasn't ready yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's most illustrative to see the sample battles (H2H) that LMArena released [1]. The outputs of Meta's model is too verbose and too 'yappy' IMO. And looking at the verdicts, it's no wonder by people are discounting LMArena rankings.[1]: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/Llama-4-Maverick-03...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620452</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Brunel University found that saccharin, a common artificial sweetener, has surprising potential to combat antibiotic resistance. The study shows that saccharin can enhance the effectiveness of certain antibiotics against resistant bacterial strains, suggesting that it may be used as an adjunct therapy to improve treatment outcomes in infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. This discovery opens new avenues for addressing the growing global health challenge of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed the world’s smallest pacemaker, which is roughly the size of a grain of rice. This innovative device, created using a miniaturized form of the existing technology, can potentially be implanted without the need for extensive surgical procedures. The small size allows it to address a wide range of heart rhythm problems, offering a less invasive and more efficient solution for patients. This breakthrough could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with heart conditions by providing a more accessible and manageable way to regulate heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;

It has to be close to the heart so it’s probably not going into the bloodstream. And you can’t really inject something precisely into the heart itself while it is pumping, right? And do you just aim by hand or is there some apparatus that does the alignment so you hit a specific location and depth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has also been designed to dissolve into the body when no longer needed, sparing patients invasive surgery.More likely, it will just remain a (hopefully) inert embedded implant. If it has active electronics, and thus semiconductors, I doubt e.g. silicon will dissolve.Edit: care to refute?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be fair, that's a pretty huge grain of rice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43585911</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons why many companies fail to address and fix bugs in their software products effectively. It highlights factors such as prioritization of new features over bug fixes, lack of accountability, insufficient resources, and the challenge of reproducing issues. The author emphasizes that understanding the impact of bugs on user experience and business reputation is crucial for companies. Furthermore, the piece suggests that fostering a culture of quality and proactive communication can help organizations better manage and resolve software issues, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of the time, a lack of bugfixes comes from the incentive structure management has created. Specifically, you rarely get rewarded for fixing things. You get rewarded for shipping new things. In effect, you're punished for fixing things because that's time you're not shipping new things.Ownership is another one. For example, product teams who are responsible for shipping new things but support for existing things get increasingly pushed onto support teams. This is really a consequence of the same incentive structure.This is partially why I don't think that all subscription software is bad. The Adobe end of the spectrum is bad. The Jetbrains end is good. There is value in creating good, reliable software. If your only source of revenue is new sales then bugs are even less of a priority until it's so bad it makes your software virtually unusuable. And usually it took a long while to get there with many ignored warnings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't effective at a large org, but if you're running a small company/startup, just have an engineer "help out" with support every so often. We'd ask devs to run the support desk when the person was on vacation and also had a general rotation through.It's good for building customer empathy but also for helping the people who build the product understand how it's used. The intuition you build up from those experiences is very powerful.Also, about two hours into handling support tickets for the same issue, 99% of devs will just fix the problem. So you create a very elegant incentive structure for bugfixing that circumvents a lot of the traditional structural issues.Of course you can't do this in a big company, which is one of the structural disadvantages that come with size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally I've never found it a problem to just fix things that I see are broken, as a dev, without PM approval, even in very dysfunctional organizations. Sometimes it even goes noticed and people applaud you for it.In other words: though I acknowledge that the phenomenon described in the article is real, I sometimes feel it's just because developers accept a reality that doesn't need to be accepted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615346</guid></item><item><title>37.

Hence, "The police are the public and the public are the police."https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principlesEdit: another choice quote from that article, from the Home Office itself in 2012:"The Home Office defined the legitimacy of policing, in the eyes of the public, as based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Users want their secrets to be secret.Apple wants its users' secrets to be secret.The UK wants the fact it wants Apple to reveal anyone's secrets to be secret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parent link seemingly doesn’t have the article when viewed on mobile.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A flagged post mentions this is racist and typical anti immigration rhetoric.That's not true, there are only two types of North Korean people you'll meet, either those that have defected and escaped North Korea or those that are agents of the state of North Korea.There are very few defectors in existence and once they escape they're given full South Korean citizenship. This article is not about those people.The vast majority of North Koreans outside North Korea are not defectors, instead they are controlled state assets. There are no North Korean people outside the country that are free citizens. Every single North Korean authorised to leave the country is working directly for their government often to raise money for the regime, to steal IP, to infiltrate for some nefarious purpose.Having one of these North Korean active assets in your company is extremely dangerous, your business is now at risk of leaks, theft, or worst something being modified like added vulnerabilities that could be exploited later in cyber attacks.So no, this article is not racist at all and really has nothing to do with the recent political situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This part is genius:    &gt; Nowadays, Leggio told Fortune he won’t even set up an interview with a candidate who seems promising on paper unless they agree to one final step.

    “Say something negative about Kim Jong Un,” Leggio tells potential job candidates, referring to the third-generation authoritarian Supreme Leader of North Korea, officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through research, Leggio learned insulting the DPRK’s Supreme Leader is forbidden, and North Korean citizens could face serious punishment for showing anything less than reverence.

    “The first time I ever did it, the person started freaking out and cursing,” said Leggio.

    The job seeker subsequently blocked Leggio across all social media platforms. Now Leggio makes the same request before every single interview. Other startups and founders he knows are asking the same thing of job seekers, he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company accidently employed on for about 3 days until we realized what was happening and cut them loose.I recognize this was likely sourced from a PR agency working for a security product meant for global employee verification but I can attest they are addressing a real problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617352</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of using less htmx in web development to create more efficient and maintainable applications. It emphasizes the importance of simplifying code and reducing reliance on JavaScript libraries by leveraging standard HTML and server-rendered pages. The author argues that minimizing the use of htmx can lead to better performance, easier debugging, and a more straightforward development process. By focusing on essential functionalities and avoiding complexity, developers can create cleaner and more effective web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is amazing how quickly a simple, traditional, "collection of pages" type website actually works if you don't do annoying things to slow it down. Most websites would be absolutely fine if a) HTTP was used reasonably well to set things like cache headers, and so (as mentioned in the article) and b) if a load of user-irrelevant stuff like tracking and advertising code wasn't thrown in as well. A simple page with standard HTML, passably optimised assets where needed, and only the JS needed for actual functionality, should be almost instant on most modern connections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Like any new tool, especially a tool that got popular as quickly as htmx, there are differing schools of thought on how best to use it. My approach—which I believe necessary to achieve the results described above—requires you to internalize something that htmx certainly hints at, but doesn’t enforce: use plain HTML wherever possible.That’s the path for ultimate long term functional web pages!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two sides to the argument which I think should be treated separately: a) Is it a good idea overall? and b) is htmx implementation good enough?a) I think so, yes. I've seen much more spa that have a completely broken page navigation. This approach does not fit all use cases, but if you remember that the whole idea of htmx is that you rely on webserver giving you page updates as opposed to having a thick js app rendering it all the way it makes sense. And yes, js libraries should be wrapped to function properly in many cases, but you would do the same with no react-native components in any react app for exampleb) I don't think so. htmx boost functionality is an afterthought and it will always be like this. Compare it with turbo [1] where this is a core feature and the approach is to use turbo together with stimulus.js which gives you automagical component life cycle management. Turbo still has it's pains (my favorite gh issue [2]), but otherwise it works fine[1]: https://turbo.hotwired.dev/

I'm trying to track down the source of this figure. I see that the global "photovoltaic (PV) capacity" is at 6.6% (according to a trade organization that represents manufacturers of solar panels). I don't see a definition for "PV capacity", but I assume it means the total theoretical output of all installed solar panels, even if the output is much lower (due to panels being sub-optimally located, aligned, or having degraded over time).I'd love to be proven wrong, but I'm just not buying the 7% figure as the evidence stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620007</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The website highlights the concept of blackout poetry, an art form where individuals create poems by redacting words from existing texts, typically using a marker to obscure the unselected words. It provides an overview of techniques and inspiration for crafting blackout poetry, encouraging creativity and personal expression through the transformation of pre-existing material into new poetic forms. The site likely includes examples and possibly prompts to inspire visitors to engage in this unique artistic practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the emergence of a unique ecosystem in Oahu, Hawaii, referred to as a "freakosystem," which has been unintentionally created by human activities. It highlights how the introduction of non-native species and habitat modification has led to unexpected biological interactions and biodiversity that are distinct from the traditional Hawaiian environment. The piece discusses the implications of this new ecosystem, including potential benefits and challenges for conservation efforts, and raises questions about the impact of human influence on natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's always odd to me how people tend to think that human-created ecosystems are "freakish" or "unnatural".Humans evolved in the same environment as the ecosystems we're modifying. The buildings and cars and roads we make are made of materials we find on earth, similar to how birds build nests or ants make anthills. (Whether all the things we build are good and healthy for us and our environment is another story.)My hypothesis has long been that this view of human activity as "unnatural" was actually born of the religious perspective that some religions hold that humans were implanted into the universe from the outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; O'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degradedThe entire article presumes that novelty is a degradation -- yet offers no evidence for it. So it's just an article of faith that whatever series of major evolutionary catastrophes led to to an ecology are morally or aesthetically preferable to those of human design and intention?This disneyification of nature is a great stupidity. Nature is just a series of major crises, punctuated by periods with some novelty -- that this process should be preferable to any other, reads quite implausibly to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re interested in this, the garden below is very worth visiting.https://ntbg.org/gardens/limahuliIt’s built into sections - plants from before any humans landed in Hawaii, plants from early settlers, plants from the plantation period, etc.My favorite learning was canoe plants (maybe a different name) - plants that early settlers would bring with them when exploring new islands in their canoe that were critical to their survival. They provided food, medicine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580480</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GitHub profile is not a CV.A few things that immediately jumped at me:- Not all code is on GitHub and not all of it is public. Recently I see more and more code moving elsewhere: GitLab (both managed and self-hosted), Codeberg, Forgejo instances.- Even the code that is on GH might live outside of personal profile. Many notable FLOSS projects have their own organisations on GH. People who produce a lot of that code have direct commit access and don’t keep forks on their profiles. You’re missing all of the most prolific developers here.- Location field in a GH profile is full of jokes. Search for “space”, “internet”, “/dev/null”, etc.- It picks top repos weirdly. I tried to find my profile. It picked one repo that is not in my profile and wasn’t there probably for a long time, and another that is a public archive and hasn’t been updated since 2017. Both are forks with minimal contributions on my part. I have pinned repos in my profile that are much fresher and, arguably, more relevant.But the project looks sleek. Probably helpful in addition to Linkedin and whatever to uncover more potential candidates. I’m glad it works for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small feedback: I would like to be able to enter my own profile to see how I will appear on the site. It would also be nice to know what searches my profile would be most likely to pop up for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting idea, but it didn't work for me. I tried "Zig developer" and it showed results that hadn't done much Zig work recently.Developers known for their zig work like mitchellh, matklad, and Jarred-Sumner weren't in the results at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43621350</guid></item><item><title>48.

An invasive procedure that oxygenates and pumps blood.  It's boosted survival rate for those who are not responding to CPR (15-20 minutes duration) from 3% to 28%.  The general CPR survival rate is an exponential looking curve: starting around 20%, reducing to 10% at 10 minutes and 3% at 20 minutes [3].[1] https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-07/nsw-ambulance-ecmo-tr...[2] https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/mobile-cardiac-treatme...[3] https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076019Edit: The numbers in [3] are optimistic, as they are for in-hospital CPR, not out-of-hospital CPR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if this is true, but my cardiologist said that everyone who trains hard for a marathon has some level of heart damage from the excessive training. This sounds extreme to me, but I was in to see him for some AFIB episodes that were triggered from pushing myself too hard. It's worth noting that endurance athletes are 2 to 10 times more likely to develop AFIB compared to non-athletes. So this is a bit of warning to apply some level of moderation to your training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I - like ~20% of the humans of planet earth - have a bridged LAD coronary artery. The vast majority of those who have this congenital deformity will never know it and remain asymptomatic; a small cohort of those will, like me, have a minor heart attack and fully recover - a smaller cohort will die of sudden cardiac arrest, many of them males in their teens while practicing football or performing similar cardiac stressing events. Unfortunately determining this congenital deformity requires invasive radiological imaging - hopefully this technology will assist in it's identification sooner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596133</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't really listen to music while I'm working because I concentrate more on the music - however music is great when I'm doing "boring" tasks like gardening, or cleaning.If I'm working, I'll happily watch world cooking videos - before I was diagnosed with inattentive adhd I'd say that it was to keep the inner child happy and out of the way so the adult brain could do the work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only skimmed this but it has several things that make me suspicious. Mainly that they did not require a diagnosis for ADHD but instead separated participants based on a questionnaire regarding symptoms. Additionally their participant pool somehow contained more than 20% of neurodevelopmental disorders and other mental health disorders which seems very high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in school, many decades ago, I was constantly told that I should turn off the music while studying.  I always ignored that advice, and to this day while I'm working (I'm a software engineer) I almost always have music playing.  I'll pick instrumental music if I'm having trouble focusing; but I usually prefer upbeat music with lyrics.I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, etc.; when I was young, being "autistic" meant being almost or nearly non-functional.  But I've had my suspicions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618140</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common perception that PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities are slow and outlines how, when configured properly, they can actually provide fast and efficient search results. It explains various techniques and optimizations, such as using appropriate indexing methods, leveraging ts_vectors and ts_queries, and tuning configuration parameters to enhance performance. The author aims to debunk myths about the inefficiency of PostgreSQL's full-text search and provides insights into best practices for achieving faster search operations in applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm one of the pg_search maintainers. Hello! A few thoughts.First, both strategies - the one outlined by the Neon/ParadeDB article, and the one used here -- are presented as viable alternatives by the Postgres docs: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-tables.ht....Second - as the article correctly demonstrates, the problem with Postgres FTS isn't "how can I pick and optimize a single pre-defined query" it's "how do I bring Postgres to Elastic-level performance across a wide range of real-world boolean, fuzzy, faceted, relevance-ranked, etc. queries?"`pg_search` is designed to solve the latter problem, and the benchmarks were made to reflect that. You can always cherry-pick a query and optimize it at the expense of data duplication and complexity. The Neon/ParadeDB benchmarks contained 12 queries in total, and the benchmarks could have:- Created composite b-tree indexes for each of the queries with boolean predicates- Extracted the all the text fields from JSONBs, stored and indexed them as a separate columns for queries against JSONBBut that's not realistic for many real-world use cases. `pg_search` doesn't require that - it's a simple index definition that works for a variety of "Elastic style" queries and Postgres types and doesn't ask the user to duplicate every text column.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Mistake #1: Calculating tsvector On-the-Fly (Major issue)I'm shocked that the original post being referred to made this mistake. I recently implemented Postgres FTS in a personal project, and did so by just reading the Postgres documentation on FTS following the instructions. The docs lead you through the process of creating the base unoptimized case, and then optimising it, explaining the purpose of each step and why it's faster. It's really clear that is what it's doing, and I could only assume that someone making this mistake is either doing so to intentionally misrepresent Postgres FTS, or because they haven't read the basic documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there were some explain plans in either post, since I don't get what's going on.If the query uses the index, then the on the fly tsvector rechecks are only on the matches and the benchmark queries have LIMIT 10, so few rechecks right?Edit: yes but the query predicates have conditions on 2 gin indexes, so I guess the planner chooses to recheck all the matches for one index first even though it could avoid lots of work by rechecking row-wise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43627646</guid></item><item><title>2.

Genuinely interested to see how this ends up playing out. Nvidia seemed 'untouchable' for so long in this space that its nice to see things get shaken up.I know they aren't selling the TPU as boxed units, but still, even as hardware that backs GCP services and what not, its interesting to see how it'll shake out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631274</guid></item><item><title>3.

When I was working in engineering in the early aughts, we mocked the Chinese as being able only to copy American technology. Today, China is competitive with or ahead of America in key technology areas, including nuclear power, AI, EVs, and batteries.We need to anticipate a future where China is equal to America on a per capita basis, but four times bigger. Is that a world where “Designed by Apple in California, Made in China” still makes sense? What will be America’s competitive edge in that scenario?What seems most likely to me in the future is that the US will find itself in the same position the UK is in now. Dominating finance and services won’t mean anything when both the IP and the physical products are being produced somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But if we bump the cost of freight, insurance, and customs from $5 to, say, $28, then they wholesale the shoes to Footlocker for about $75. And if Footlocker purchases Nike shoes for $75, then they retail them for $150. Everyone needs to fixed percentages to avoid losses.I don't understand this paragraph.  If Footlocker was okay with $50 profit/shoe, why do they need to claim $75 profit/shoe in their costs per shoe go up?  The costs of handling the shoes, retail space, advertising, and labor are all fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631543</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not guessing is perhaps the most important thing to the business.I developed a lot of my problem solving skills in semiconductor manufacturing  where the cost of a bad assumption tends to be astronomical. You need to be able to determine exactly what the root cause is 100% of the time or everything goes to hell really fast. If there isn't a way to figure out the root cause, you now have 2 tickets to resolve.I'll throw an entire contraption away the moment I determine it has accumulated some opacity that antagonizes root cause analysis. This is why I aggressively avoid use of non-vanilla technology stacks. You can certainly chase the rabbit over the fence into the 3rd party's GitHub repo, but I find the experience gets quite psychedelic as you transition between wildly varying project styles, motivations and scopes.Being deeply correct nearly all of the time is probably the fastest way to build a reputation. The curve can be exponential over time with the range being the value of the problem you are entrusted with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Read the Reference&gt; Don’t GuessI find that, when working with a new "thing," I often like to guess for about an hour or so before I really do a deep dive into the reference. Or, I'll read a stackoverflow answer or two, play around with it, and then go to reference.Why?Often there's a lot of context in the reference that only makes sense once I've had some hands-on time with whatever the reference is describing.This is especially the case when learning a new language or API: I'll go through a tutorial / quickstart; "guess" at making a change; and then go back and read the reference with a better understanding of the context.BTW: This is why I like languages and IDEs that support things like intellisense. It's great to be able to see little bits of documentation show up in my IDE to help me in my "guess" stage of learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Don’t go to Stack Overflow, don’t ask the LLM, don’t guess, just go straight to the source. Oftentimes, it’s surprisingly accessible and well-written."It's a bit like math books. I dreaded reading formal math during my engineering -- always read accessible text. Got a little better in my master's and could read demse chapters which got to the point quickly. At least now I can appreciate why people write terse references, even Tutte books.Some references are a pleasure to use. For rust crates, I always go to docs.rs and search there. It's just fantastic. i can search for a function that returns a particular type or accept a particular type etc. hoogle from Haskell was lovely too when I took a functional programming course in college. Cpp reference is also pretty good -- thanks for adding examples.Today I was reading boto3 python library docs, and I immediately missed docs.rs!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43629307</guid></item><item><title>5.

All I want is a simple example conversation that includes the actual LLM outputs used to trigger a call and the JSON that goes over the wire… maybe I’ll take some time and make a cheat-sheet.I have to say, the endorsements at the end somehow made this seem worse…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some very quick initial thoughts - the json spec has some similarities to mcp: https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=agent-card - there's an agent card that describes capabilities that google wants websites to host at https://DOMAIN/.well-known/agent.json according to https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/agent_discovery so crawlers can scrape to discover agents.The jsonrpc calls look similar-ish to mcp tool calls except the inputs and outputs look closer to the inputs/outputs from calling an LLM (ie messages, artifacts, etc.).The JS server example that they give is interesting https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/js/src/serve... - they're using a generator to send sse events back to the caller - a little weird to expose as the API instead of just doing what express allows you to do after setting up an sse connection (res.send / flush multiple times).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631381</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a somewhat contrarian opinion. I think if you're making a clone of Tetris you should actually take design cues from the somewhat more obscure Tetris the Grand Master series instead of the "guideline" or NES Tetris rules. TGM's rotation and kick rules are a lot more elegant and avoid a lot of unneeded complexity. Guideline Tetris kicks let you do absurd and weird things (look up the series of kicks that make up a T-Spin Triple and see if that makes sense to you) and rewards doing canned setups really fast, whereas TGM's game design is all about doing good stacking very fast.The TGM randomization algorithm is also pretty elegant. 7 bag is a bit extreme, it gives you such a perfect set of pieces at all times that it's genuinely less challenging and fun. TGM's random piece algorithm is a lot simpler: the randomizer has a 4-piece history window and it tries multiple times (IIRC, 6) to find a unique piece that hasn't appeared in that window. It is initialized to SSZZ to lower the odds of starting with an S or Z early on. (~~They also use the Mersenne Twister as their PRNG, which was a pretty good PRNG in an era where many games still used LCGs.~~ edit: Apparently, they do not. Don't ask me where I got this, I have no idea.)Now of course I'm not sure if it matters at all for this particular game since it isn't really a Tetris clone at all, but while TGM is a well-known cult classic for people deep into Tetris it's relatively obscure outside of that circle (and presumably outside of Japan.) The Tetris Company is very strange about licensing and has apparently, as the legend has it, blocked and forced changes on TGM releases for a very long time due to the fact that it doesn't fit with the Tetris guideline rules they enforce in an oddly totalitarian fashion, probably suppressing the game even further in an era where speed games and competitive gaming is a lot more popular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rabbit hole runs much deeper, this is a specification of the rotation system for current (modern) Tetris games:https://harddrop.com/wiki/SRSThe "modern" rules ("guideline", as the community calls them), with Hold, 7-bag, multiple previews and a rotation system that allows easy T-spins make for more interesting multiplayer games that go beyond "who can spam Tetrises the fastest".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the implied general principle of the wall kick - if the user tries to do an action in a state that doesn't allow it, if there's something that's useful and pretty close, do that instead.For instance, I'm building a tree editor with vim movement keys, and I found that a "j" that brings me up to the first child or next sibling node is strictly more useful than a "j" that only descends to children and a "l" that only goes to the next sibling.Obviously, you have to be very careful to avoid introducing footguns, but the idea of "don't dogmatically adhere to operation semantics" is good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631656</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the chroot technique, a Unix-based method that enables the execution of a program in a modified root directory, isolating it from the rest of the file system. This technique is commonly used to enhance security by restricting a program's access to the system while allowing it to run in a controlled environment. The piece outlines the benefits of chroot, such as improved security and system integrity, as well as potential pitfalls, including the complexity of managing dependencies and limitations in user permissions. Overall, the article provides insights into how chroot can be effectively implemented for various applications in system administration and software deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories - I owned a large web hosting company and we had thousands of machines. When hardware issues came up, or machines wouldn't boot, using this method was our first line of defense - we'd boot the machine from a burned copy of "Recovery Is Possible" which was an all-in-one Linux distro for recovery, then mount the partitions and chroot in to figure out what is going on - or use rsync to migrate data off as needed.Just looked and it looks like "Recovery Is Possible" hasn't been updated in a dozen years which dates my story, but I fondly remember overnight phone calls from panicked new sysadmins and telling them to be calm and "RIP it and get chrooted in" and then waking up to help them troubleshoot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With qemu-user and binfmt you can even chroot into foreign CPU architectures, which is a handy thing to have when you mount your phone's eMMC to fix a hacking session gone wrong.Though these days you may want to look into things like systemd-nspawn instead of plain chroot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually wish that instead of docker &amp; etc we had just gotten a better chroot... Or maybe just a new kernel syscall that is chroot()++.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632379</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of Content Security Policies (CSP) to enhance the security of the Firefox frontend. It outlines the importance of CSP in mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded and executed within the browser. The author provides insights into the specific CSP rules applied to Firefox, the challenges faced during implementation, and the overall impact on improving the browser's security posture. The goal is to share best practices and encourage developers to adopt similar strategies in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox really needs to fix their CSP for extensions before this kind of thing.Here is the 9 year old bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267027And their extension store does not permit workarounds, even though they themselves have confirmed it's a bug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSP is really great at plugging these kinds of security holes, but it flummoxes me that most developers and designers don't take them seriously enough to implement properly (styles must only be set though &lt;link&gt;, and JS likewise exists only in external files). Doing any styling or scripting inline should be frowned upon as hard as table-based layouts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an entire class of vulnerabilities that would've never been possible with XUL, is that correct?I appreciate they had to move for other reasons but I also really don't like the idea that the DevTools and browser chrome itself now has all of the same security issues/considerations as anything else "web" does. It was bad with Electron (XSS suddenly becoming an RCE) and makes me pretty nervous here too :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43630388</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SpacetimeDB fits into a genre of tech that I want to call "universe brain reorgs" - structural re-arrangements that might unlock wild performance increases. The challenge with these is that they require devs to re-align their thinking and it's hard to disentangle if "the problem" is that the technology isn't being fully embraced or if the promises of the tech don't work for your use case.Other techs in this category have seen a lot of success. I'd classify Elixir and Node as being similar in that you adopt a stack to get access to some rare guarantees and also accept new or exotic limits.I think these things tend to rely on having clear-eyed visionaries out in front, able to show off their strengths in open source. Without a successful project it's hard to believe the claims. I hope clockwork labs is able to deliver their example game (it seems high risk because, even if the game is a technical wonder - what if it isn't fun?!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best comment from last time this got posted:I kept on reading expecting to see motion prediction, multiversion, or similar given the name and focus on games, but no. This is a totally normal database, designed for low latency and with support for WASM stored procedures. You can host your own server or they will rent you one.
Don't get me wrong, this looks very nice. It looks like a solid building block for persistent worlds in multiplayer games. You'll just have to do your lag masking netcode yourself.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43593913&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; SpacetimeDB wasn't built in a vacuum. It's the system powers our own large-scale MMORPG BitCraft. We designed it specifically for the performance requirements of games. That means extremely low latency (~100 us/Tx) and extremely high throughput (~1,000,000 Tx/s).If you are trying to build a new MMO that scales to the moon, you might want to take a look at how the existing market goes about things.Take World of Warcraft for example. You could probably put a $20 MySQL VPS behind a realm and have it reliably persist state with how authoritative and infrequently updated the clients are.Being clever with what you can trust the client with and how the server reconciles events is where I think you will find most of the scaling hacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631822</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It’s the T-bills wot dun it."That’s my read on why the U.S. just paused the global tariff hike to 10%.From the beginning, I’ve believed the executive branch's real goal was to push down the yield on the 10-year Treasury. Why? Because Uncle Sam has to refinance a mountain of debt this year, and the cost of that depends heavily on Treasury yields — especially the 10-year. That’s the rate that sets the tone for everything from mortgages to corporate borrowing.So they tried to spook markets. Introduce global tariffs. Stir up uncertainty. And it worked—at first. Yields dipped. Traders moved to Treasuries as a typical flight-to-safety.But then something flipped.Instead of being seen as a safe haven, U.S. debt itself started to look shaky. Maybe it was the deficit outlook, maybe the global response to tariffs — but whatever it was, yields started climbing. Fast.At that point, the strategy backfired. The executive branch had no choice but to walk it back. So they paused the tariffs.Because when your national budget depends on cheap debt, you can't afford a crisis of confidence in your bonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 10% apparently also apply to Canada and Mexico now, which they didn’t before:&gt; In a strange turn of events, the president seems to have added another 10 percent tariff to Canada and Mexico. Asked earlier if the 10 percent tariff extended to those countries, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said that it did. And a White House official clarified for me just now that that was the case. Previously, Canada and Mexico had been exempted from this round of “reciprocal” tariffs, though they still faced a 25 percent tariff that the president imposed last month on many of their goods.https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/08/business/trump-tarif...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibly because lawsuits challenging the power of the President to impose tariffs under the Emergency Economic Powers Act are underway.[1] GOP support for Congress taking back control of tariffs is building.[2] At some point, Congress or the courts will take his toys away.[1] https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-hit-lawsuit-group-his...[2] https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5236142-congress-tariff-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43634806</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A common question is: “how much are students using AI to cheat?” That’s hard to answer, especially as we don’t know the specific educational context where each of Claude’s responses is being used.I built a popular product that helps teachers with this problem.Yes, it's "hard to answer", but let's be honest... it's a very very widespread problem. I've talked to hundreds of teachers about this and it's a ubiquitous issue. For many students, it's literally "let me paste the assignment into ChatGPT and see what it spits out, change a few words and submit that".I think the issue is that it's so tempting to lean on AI. I remember long nights struggling to implement complex data structures in CS classes. I'd work on something for an hour before I'd have an epiphany and figure out what was wrong. But that struggling was ultimately necessary to really learn the concepts. With AI, I can simply copy/paste my code and say "hey, what's wrong with this code?" and it'll often spot it (nevermind the fact that I can just ask ChatGPT "create a b-tree in C" and it'll do it). That's amazing in a sense, but also hurts the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Students primarily use AI systems for creating (using information to learn something new)this is a smooth way to not say "cheat" in the first paragraph and to reframe creativity in a way that reflects positively on llm use. in fairness they then say&gt; This raises questions about ensuring students don’t offload critical cognitive tasks to AI systems.and later they report&gt; nearly half (~47%) of student-AI conversations were Direct—that is, seeking answers or content with minimal engagement. Whereas many of these serve legitimate learning purposes (like asking conceptual questions or generating study guides), we did find concerning Direct conversation examples including: - Provide answers to machine learning multiple-choice questions
- Provide direct answers to English language test questions
- Rewrite marketing and business texts to avoid plagiarism detectionkudos for addressing this head on. the problem here, and the reason these are not likely to be democratizing but rather wedge technologies, is not that they make grading harder or violate principles of higher education but that they can disable people who might otherwise learn something&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like Anthropic has an incentive to minimize how much students use LLMs to write their papers for them.In the article, I guess this would be buried in&gt;  Students also frequently used Claude to provide technical explanations or solutions for academic assignments (33.5%)—working with AI to debug and fix errors in coding assignments, implement programming algorithms and data structures, and explain or solve mathematical problems."Write my essay" would be considered a "solution for academic assignment," but by only referring to it obliquely in that paragraph they don't really tell us the prevalence of it.(I also wonder if students are smart, and may keep outright usage of LLMs to complete assignments on a separate, non-university account, not trusting that Anthropic will keep their conversations private from the university if asked.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633383</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for the context, I've been making (and selling) database (migration/translation) tools for 20-ish years.What you have built can definitely become a product supporting you with a very nice income. Free version can stay free but you can sell solo licenses and team licenses as subscriptions. Paid license users will also have your support - and that matters to companies.As others have said, commercial features can be built on top of the OSS product, like Electron desktop client, support for more databases, for views/procedures etc.There is no downside to trying to commercialize this. Whoever wants to use what you have built so far can continue and I guarantee that many companies would be happy to give you $50/month for a more advanced version with support.(edit for typo)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a really cool project.Some observations...First I'd get some legal advice for how to convert this idea / product into a thing that you own and have a stake in, but that's distinct from you.  This means you'd be able to collect money and attribute that money to the product, you'd be able to sell it to someone else and walk away from it, etc.  This legal construct is important; probably not _necessary_ but very useful.You seem to have a reasonable community contributing to and using the project; that's your most valuable asset.  Make up a brief roadmap of where you'd like to take the project in six and eighteen months, share that with the community.  Think about how some projects, like Elastic.co, grew based on community feedback and how ultimately perhaps those companies felt they needed to change the company in ways that many in the original community disagreed with.  There are lots of sides to that coin, and you as the founder need to think about how you'd want to develop the product.Lastly, once you've got a clear accounting mechanism of how to track money from it and costs of it, you should just .... start asking people for money.  "How much is a support contract worth for this?"  "How much is it worth to you to focus on developing this feature instead of that?"  Obviously -- be very cautious if people are offering money in exchange for fractional ownership of "the thing" but even that may be palatable... but make sure you've had someone representing your interests read the contract...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can even export as Mermaid? That's awesome. I could see that being super useful as a way to take a db schema and turn it into a chart for a github readme. Definitely bookmarking this.Btw, the SQL import doesn't seem to work for an sqlite `.schema` dump; it breaks on the PRIMARY KEY here:    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "__EFMigrationsHistory" (
        "MigrationId" TEXT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT "PK___EFMigrationsHistory" PRIMARY KEY,
        "ProductVersion" TEXT NOT NULL
    );

(This is the standard migrations table that Entity Framework creates.)W/r/t monetization, you should know there's a really powerful flowchart tool called draw.io that's already free. It's not tailored specifically towards databases the way yours is, but it can make similar graphs, so if you go too hard on monetizing you might cause people to just use that instead. Maybe there are some more B2B-oriented extensions or db integrations, or maybe a team collaboration feature you could add without compromising the core tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43627758</guid></item><item><title>13.

Maybe a list of the actual characters in the story?I had the same problem with https://timelines.0xmmo.co where I had to ground it in Wikipedia articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried "The Wise Man's Fear" and the results were not so great[1]. It got a good number of the characters, but only showed them being related to Kvothe. Harry potter worked better'ish, but still not great[2].My primary interest would be using these relational graphs to generate better structured summaries of stories in a structured JSON object for improved search/recommendations.- [1]https://austen.pages.dev/ecbc2d49-c10d-4e49-ac68-0d37a819b52...- [2]https://austen.pages.dev/ace16c1d-c74e-4737-a98d-5401047a1cd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The system prompt can be found here:https://github.com/herol3oy/austen/blob/main/src/server/rout...It would be more interesting if the graph could be generated by sourcing an arbitrary epub file into a RAG and have it figure out character relations without reading the whole book.I wouldn't be surprised if it all could be done with a script using aichat[1] and rendering the diagram using graphviz.[1] https://github.com/sigoden/aichat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633298</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I didn't realize pipewire had builtin support for this! I've been using a different piece of software called Easy Effects[1] on my framework laptop.To equalize my laptop, I ended up buying a umik-1, and using REW to calculate all the filter coefficients (you can import REW's filter export right into Easy Effects). It's a subtle difference at first, but it's much cleaner (I also usually have a compressor and loudness effect enabled, as the framework speakers are pretty quiet).[1] https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, when attempting to apply this to speakers, the anechoic frequency response is required. If you try to equalize for flat-in-room response, the results are terrible. See this video[1] for loads more information and context.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpUDuUtxPM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ho wow, the sample video shows incredible results, I'd love to read more about how to configure it with my own laptop and microphone. Settings ought to be different for each laptop model, right ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43635295</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "linux-kernel-defence-map" provides a comprehensive overview of security features and defense mechanisms implemented within the Linux kernel. It serves as a resource for developers and security researchers, categorizing various defensive strategies, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques to enhance Linux kernel security.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is by the author of the very helpful kernel-hardening-checker: https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hardening-checkerAn interesting tool for analyzing your personal kernel config file and pointing out areas for security improvement. It's more comprehensive than KSPP (https://kspp.github.io/) but sometimes goes a little too far, suggesting disabling kernel features you may actively use.Definitely worth trying!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of defenses is pretty impressive. The number of out-of-tree and commercial defenses is also impressive. The amount dedicated to specifics of C (UB, bounds checks, use-after-free) is relatively small.It would be interesting to compare to, say, OpenBSD, with its apparently numerous security and defense-in-depth features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it inspiring that we are getting to where we are dealing with models that classify vulnerabilities at a systems level. However I also think we are kind of barking up the wrong three. There is IMHO something wrong with the current strategy of scaling up the von Neumann architecture. It leads to fragile software partitioning, noisy neighbors and both slow and sometimes unintended communication through shared memory. I’ve tried to lay this out in detail here https://lnkd.in/dRNSYPWC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597264</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If you want something done, do it yourself", as said one of the best sci-fi movie villains.A GUI toolkit that does not burden itself with compatibility with anything but X (working directly with Xlib) is already much leaner than GTK or Qt. The use of Common Lisp instead of C, Vala, or even C++ makes the problem even easier to tackle. No wonder Barium ended up being so compact, while doing everything a simple but complete toolkit needs to do.It may even age gracefully, as the author wants it to, provided that Xlib stays around. Or maybe it could eventually develop a thin abstraction layer to allow pluggable rectangle-drawing and text-rendering APIs, and start supporting Wayland, too.And emphatically yes, I want scrollbars back where scrollbars are due. Aping Apple in this regard was a very unfortunate choice by GTK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Confine yourself into the prison of someone else’s walled garden at no additional cost.Objection, your honor: At great additional cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;every rant like this inevitably goes into Gnome/GTK world. I must insist how much "better" (for these kinds of people) the Qt/KDE world is! People who are so passionate about this stuff just don't give any credit to one side of the equation that has stuck to its guns in terms of making apps that still have a billion buttons with text labels on them.Seriously, if you find yourself annoyed at Gnome, you can set up KDE and (mostly) have no issues.I say all this... Qt is a tricky beast to use.

One area I see being a massive problem is separating 'brands' and 'products', especially with companies that do a really poor job of delineating between their different brands over time.For example 'Quickbooks', 'Quickbooks Online', 'Intuit Quickbooks' all show up occasionally when you ask about 'Accounting software'.As an aside 'Accounting Software', I'm not seeing QBO in the top 3, and Freshbooks in number one. I have never had that result whenever I've run reports.https://productrank.ai/topic/accounting-software
https://www.aibrandrank.com/reports/89&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this idea and think it’s really creative! But for feedback I’d like to see more clarity on what you mean by “rankings”.For example, I searched “Ways to die” and got
1. Drowning
2. Firearms
3. Death during sleepWhat exactly is the ranking criteria here?

I’m intentionally not writing this with Aqua but by hand and it is taking so much longer. This to me feels like what Apple Intelligence could be, it is so much better than stuff all of the big tech is doing. For example, if you tell Siri voice dictation to go back and delete something what Siri will do is just write out “go back and delete something“ also if you tell Siri to go back and spell a name differently all Siri will do is write out the letters that you said to go back and type out. Honestly, for voice dictation software it feels like travelling to another planet in terms of improvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like it'll slurp up all your data and upload it into a cloud. Thanks, no.

They checked it for cancer but not HPV, even though they said it was almost certainly HPV.So for $129 I took the OraRisk HPV test which tests for 51 strains, including the ones associated with cancer, and the results came up negative.So I maybe sort of probably don't have HPV, or may have but don't anymore. Or maybe something like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The antiviral valacyclovir was discussed in an article in The Economist recently. Is used to treat herpes simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). What the Economist article discussed is that the drug seems to reduce the severity and onset of dementia. The drug's patent expired long ago.I'll be seeing my doc soon and will be requesting to begin treatment.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valaciclovirhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045215/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised there aren't any commercialized products considering its efficacy and simple origin.I also wonder if there is any way it could be modified to protect more of the body besides just saliva.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636302</guid></item><item><title>21.

Maybe this could have a place in embedded systems?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a similar idea but for audio effect and music production:https://github.com/wasm-audio/wasm-audio-examplesFor workflow, how do you think of async in wit at this moment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One issue I had many time with workflow engines was updates. I have a workflow and it has already running instances. 2 scenarios:Can I update the workflow while it has running instances without interfering the running instances?Can I update a running instance with a new version of the workflow to patch some flaw? If no, can I replay an updated version of a workflow with the log of an old workflow version?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636568</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article, "Baking the Y Combinator from Scratch: Part 1," explores the concept of creating a startup incubator similar to Y Combinator, detailing its fundamental components and processes. It discusses the importance of mentorship, funding, and a supportive network for startups, as well as the criteria for selecting promising startups. The author emphasizes the significance of a structured program that fosters innovation and growth, while also sharing insights on the challenges and opportunities in establishing such an incubator. Overall, the piece provides a foundational starting point for understanding the mechanics behind successful startup accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants this in a humorous 1 hour format, watch the legendary Jim Weirich (rip) explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FITJMJjASUsDon't be discouraged that it is in Ruby as the concepts are completely general. Great watch even though I never coded a line of Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a technique to remember this? I will understand it today and forget after a few weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From scratch it's also easy dress up a quoted Y combinator as in Löb's theorem. Start with the usual Y combinator  Y = \f. (\x.f(x x)) (\x.f(x x))
    : (p -&gt; p) -&gt; p

which can produce a thing of type p from a function f : p -&gt; p.Now Löb's theorem states that []([]p -&gt; p) -&gt; []p, which can be read, "if you have the source code to transform (the source code of a thing of type p) to a thing of type p, then you can produce the source code for a thing of type p". Let's embellish Y using {} to denote the quoting comonad.  Y' = \{f}. (\{x}.{f{x{x}}}) {\{x}.{f{x{x}}}}
     : []([]p -&gt; p) -&gt; []p

To get there, just add quotes as needed: f must be quoted, f's result must be quoted, and f takes a quoted input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636230</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the upcoming advancements in visual reasoning technology, highlighting its potential applications across various fields. It emphasizes the significance of integrating visual reasoning into artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making processes, improve problem-solving capabilities, and facilitate more intuitive human-computer interactions. The piece also touches on the challenges faced in developing such technology and anticipates the transformative impact it will have on industries like healthcare, finance, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to ignore the mixed record of video generation models:  For visual reasoning practice, we can do supervised fine-tuning on sequences similar to the marble example above. For instance, to understand more about the physical world, we can show the model sequential pictures of Slinkys going down stairs, or basketball players shooting 3-pointers, or people hammering birdhouses together.... 

  But where will we get all this training data? For spatial and physical reasoning tasks, we can leverage computer graphics to generate synthetic data. This approach is particularly valuable because simulations provide a controlled environment where we can create scenarios with known outcomes, making it easy to verify the model's predictions. But we'll also need real-world examples. Fortunately, there's an abundance of video content online that we can tap into. While initial datasets might require human annotation, soon models themselves will be able to process videos and their transcripts to extract training examples automatically. 

Almost every video generator makes constant "folk physics" errors and doesn't understand object permanence. DeepMind's Veo2 is very impressive but still struggles with object permanence and qualitatively nonsensical physics: https://x.com/Norod78/status/1894438169061269750Humans do not learn these things by pure observation (newborns understand object permanence, I suspect this is the case for all vertebrates).  I doubt transformers are capable of learning it as robustly, even if trained on all of YouTube. There will always be "out of distribution" physical nonsense involving mistakes humans (or lizards) would never make, even if they've never seen the specific objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example of the cat and detective hat shows that even with the latest update, it isn't "editing" the image. The generated cat is younger, with bigger, brighter eyes, more "perfect" ears.I found that when editing images of myself, the result looked weird, like a funky version of me. For the cat, it looks "more attractive" I guess, but for humans (and I'd imagine for a cat looking at the edited cat with a keen eye for cat faces), the features often don't work together when changed slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's sad that they used 4o's image generation feature for the cat example which does some diffusion or something else, results in the whole image changing. They should've instead used Gemini 2.0 Flash's image generation feature (or at least mentioned it!), which, even if far lower quality and resolution (max of 1024x1024, but Gemini will try to match the res of the original image, so you can get something like 681x1024), is much much better at leaving the untouched parts of the image actually "untouched".Here's the best out of a few attempts for a really similar prompt, more detailed since Flash is a much smaller model "Give the cat a detective hat and a monocle over his right eye, properly integrate them into the photo.". You can see how the rest of the image is practically untouched to the naked human eye: https://ibb.co/zVgDbqV3Honestly Google has been really good at catching up in the LLM race, and their modern models like 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro are one of (or the) best in their respective areas. I hope that they'll scale up their image generation feature to base it on 2.5 Pro (or maybe 3 Pro by the time they do it) for higher quality and prompt adherence.If you want, you can give 2.0 Flash image gen a try for free (with generous limits) on https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat, just select it in the model selector on the right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633568</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses efforts to improve graph accessibility for blind and low-vision readers through innovative technologies. Researchers at MIT have developed a tactile graph system that allows users to feel the shapes and patterns represented in data visualizations. This system integrates 3D printing and haptic feedback, enabling users to engage with graphs in a meaningful way. The initiative aims to bridge the information gap for visually impaired individuals, ensuring they can access and understand data just as effectively as their sighted peers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One time when I was very young, I was given some paper to draw on. It looked and felt like normal paper, but when you drew on it with a marker, it would swell up under the marker line creating a raised area. Putting a piece in water revealed that it was some sort of ultra compressed sponge, like a thin version of those compacted kitchen sponges you can get.I realized later that it must have been some sort of "paper for the blind" so that you could draw on it or maybe print on it with an inkjet and be able to feel the surface even if you couldn't see it. Maybe it was just a sponge, but it didn't seem any thicker than normal paper. It's been 20+ years and I've never encountered anything like it since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great to see an automated method for this, even if it still needs to be reviewed by an expert. Back on the 2011-2014 era I was on a team which helped make materials available for a chemistry grad student. I wasn't aware of the standards book, but followed more or less the same process outlined in the paper, using GIMP to simplify images, paste into Word, and add textboxes with braille font to the images, and then embossed. It was probably 5-10 minutes of effort for a basic graph, and we were doing the work for entire math and chemistry books. This would have saved so much time for us!We also had to figure out how to represent electron clouds. Some could be done as 2-D representations, but eventually 3-D was required. We created a plugin for Blender which would import a MacMolPlt save file, generate the structure for the molecule (coordinates for each atom, bond types connecting the atoms), and a point cloud for the electron cloud. Each column of the periodic table was a different shape, each row was a different scale. It worked pretty well, and generating STL files was automated.The program is somewhere on my hard drive not available publicly and probably technically owned by Iowa State or the federal government, whether they know it or not. I'm curious how much it'd take to get out running on a current version of Blender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactonom Reader seems like an interesting multi-modal approach that is readily available: https://www.tactonom.com/en/product/tactonomreader/In general, tactile graphics is a long-standing issue.  In the past, the most basic simple mechanical solution wasn't that bad.  Just needs a special kind of paper and a ballpoint pen.  My teachers used to hand-draw curves for me on demand, however, that was at high-school level...The more complex the solution gets, the more work/knowhow is required to prepare a particular graphic.  Turnaround time gets longer, and the expertise expected from the educator gets more complex.  Its questionable how many casual educators end up being able/willing to prepare graphics for/on a complex digital system...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43595193</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of hand-nixing, a traditional method of combining ingredients for baking, particularly in bread-making. It emphasizes the benefits of this technique, including improved texture and flavor development, and provides a step-by-step guide on how to effectively mix dough by hand.

I've been using Nix personally and professionally for almost 10 years now (yikes has time passed quickly!) and I have never needed to operate at the level of derivations like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, don't you just like it when projects that use hashsums, calculate them in such a way that you can't actually recalculate them on your own? And when you start digging, you find not only that it uses the same basic design of XML-DSig while barely escaping its fatal flaws, it also uses some bizarre data encodings nobody else uses for anything. And then the resulting hash is not even the truncation of the actual hash, it has an additional (again, entirely undocumented) strange post-processing step for unspecified reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I walk away from every article on or attempt to use Nix more mystified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43607325</guid></item><item><title>28.

Then delete anything you’re worried about being misinterpreted or saved by the government. That can include conversations that compromise the privacy of the people on the other end. You might delete messages about politics, contact information for political dissidents, apps that save offline copies of sensitive documents like Google Docs, even your phone’s built-in Notes app.Mind you, this is for entering the country that considers itself the freest in the world...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Locking down" is almost always a bad approach when it comes to border crossings. You have very little rights at the border, so keeping your phone locked and refusing to divulge the 20 characters password isn't really an option. Even without the threat of detaining you, they can refuse entry (if you're not a citizen/permanent resident), or seize your $1000 phone/laptop. Far better to wipe your phone and restore from backup after you've crossed the border. The article does make a good point that you should seed your wiped phone with signs of activity so it doesn't look freshly wiped.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43630624</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the Pilot Project Basic Income in Germany, where researchers and policymakers are exploring the impact of unconditional basic income on individuals and society. It outlines the project's objectives, including assessing the social, economic, and personal effects of providing financial security to participants over a three-year period. The site provides details about the project's methodology, participant criteria, and how the findings may contribute to the broader conversation on basic income as a potential social safety net. Additionally, it offers insights into the ongoing discussions and considerations surrounding basic income implementation in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of thing pops up now and again but the psychology is completely different to if basic income was actually universal and expected to continue in the long-term.Of course people don't quit their jobs and careers because they are part of a small group enrolled in a 3-year scientific study. Human behaviour is non-linear.The study doesn't cover the likely feedback effects on the broader economy that a universal rollout would have (increase in the money supply) or the broader socio-cultural changes that would likely accompany it.In short: scale matters for this kind of thing. Some things just can't be tested ahead of time empirically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cost of an annuity that pays your basic, fundamental living expenses: Food, shelter, water, etc. can be thought of as a debt that all
people are born with. In the US, you can obtain a room in an apartment, basic food, internet access, and transportation (minimal versions of all of these), for something like $15,000/year.such a lifetime annuity would cost the average 18 year old on the order of 200-300 thousand dollars. This means that an 18 year old starts with about the same level of implicit debt, that a doctor who has just finished medical school has explicit debt, except that student debt doesn't scale with inflation.A key feature of a society which values social mobility is reducing the debt burden of its children. I don't think the answer on basic income is cut and dry, and I do think its important for people to sustain themselves via their own efforts, but since you likely wouldn't increase the debt burden of a teenager, and  you also didn't select the debt burden of the average teenager. You should at least consider the possibility that you would actually choose to reduce, by some amount, the debt burden of the average teenager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry if this offends, but I am deeply skeptical that the effect of UBI is independent of common culturally influenced behaviors of where it might be implemented. Try it in an opioid epidemic stricken rust belt town in the American Midwest, or an urban ghetto (I'm not totally sold that the selection criteria for the Stockton study were unbiased) and let us know how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43636757</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI generated recruits are a fiction. That's not to say there aren't fake or bait and switch recruits but this idea makes no sense.Some background. I'm a senior developer who has performed hundreds of interviews and seen dozens of questionable recruits long before AI. Typically the scam is that an offshore consultancy wants to place some roles to collect wages. Many of these agencies are from collectivist cultures, so in the mind of the agency, they all work in our project. This may not be true, but the agency sees the position as theirs, not the recruit's. So they typically don't the issue with putting recruit A in front of the interviewer and then slotting recruit B in after the position is secured. I've seen this done with A talking while B moves their lips on camera. Now with chatGPT (and earlier to some degree with just Google Search) we just see applicants eyes focused on something they're reading when we ask questions. All of this is just as easy as an AI generated applicant (if not easier) and quite likely to get the recruit hired.A lot of this narrative is pointing the finger at China, North Korea and Russia/Ukraine. The best candidates I've fielded have been Ukrainian, Russian and Chinese. These are countries well known for their tech sectors. North Korea has executed the largest crypto heists in history. These are not groups who need to fake it.So who does this narrative serve? It serves the RTO CEOs. This makes CEOs scared to hire remote workers and lets the ones who demand it have a reason.If anything the panic around AI should reinforce the need to think critically about these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When voice authentication startup Pindrop Security posted a recent job opening, one candidate stood out from hundreds of others.&gt; The applicant, a Russian coder named Ivan, seemed to have all the right qualifications for the senior engineering role. When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop’s recruiter noticed that Ivan’s facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.&gt; That’s because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed “Ivan X,” was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan.Hm, let's read on.&gt; As for “Ivan X,” Pindrop’s Balasubramaniyan said the startup used a new video authentication program it created to confirm he was a deepfake fraud.Oh, I get it, it's an ad for Pindrop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another remote employment fraud that is much more prevalent is "Overemployment". You will get an applicant that is very skilled and hits the interview out of the park. But then when hired they are working many jobs and just trying to steal as many paychecks as they can until you fire them. They keep their first jobs resume clean and they all check out.There is a Reddit community with over 400k members to show how prevalent this is [1]. There's lots of tactics like not allowing mentions on LinkedIn so they can't be publicly mentioned and seen by other unsuspecting employers, and just maintaining plausible deniability about why they can't make an on camera meeting. It is technically not illegal so it is very lucrative and hard to detect.https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/top/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631384</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised there isn't mention that a big part of the tariff strategy is to throw the equity markets into chaos in an effort to drive down the price of the 10-year bond. There was a panic last night because the 10 year bond price started going up as stocks were trading down, which is not supposed to happen. It would be truly disruptive if the whole game gets blown up by a lack of buyers for US debt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; using trade flows to measure the health of the economic relationship with these countries — any country, really, but particularly final assembly countries — is legitimately stupidA simple way to see this is you have can a system of three countries, A, B, and C, where A only exports to B, B to C, and C to A. All have net neutral trade, but are in a deficit with someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking about the merits of these tariffs kind of misses the point. The person who wrote this article is very smart. I am sure they are smarter than I am. He has produced a pretty solid analysis of trade policy. But in articles like this people ascribe their own motivations and goals to the tariffs that aren't actually there. Buried in this article is the assumption that the motivation of tariffs and trade policy is to maintain competitiveness with China in manufacturing for both economic and security reasons.This may be important to the author but it isn't a top priority for the administration. Competitiveness with China and onshoring manufacturing are certainly talking points but they is not stated as the primary motivation for the tariffs. The administration characterizes trade imbalances as countries taking advantage of us. The tariffs are targeted based on trade imbalance. If manufacturing was the goal why apply tariffs to things like raw materials? If competition with China is the goal why apply tariffs to South Korea or Japan, pushing them closer into China's orbit? These are just not the goals of the tariffs and neither their rhetoric or actions suggest that they are.People have a hard time dealing with values and motivations that are wildly different from their own so they construct all sorts of parallel explanations and defend those instead. But talking about these explanations is non sequitur. It is like the administration adopted a policy of jailing all Capricorns and only Capricorns and people started writing think pieces about how the criminal justice system would be more efficient if they focused on programs to reduce recidivism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631276</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that has been working really well for me this year is the "internet Shabbat" rule: 24 hours of no TCP/IP every week. Friday night I pull the plug on the modem + turn off data on my phone, then enjoy all of Saturday in a disconnected mode. I can still be on the computer, just no internet.It's amazing how much things I get done... it literally feels like I have two days instead of one. If I put a item like "outdoor exercise for 30 mins" in my TODO list, then I actually do it! Close friends and family can still reach me by phone/text, but all the chat groups and other messaging app distractions are silent.I can still end up zoning out watching a movie in the evening, but it's more intentional: I had to pick the movie in advance and download it so I can view it offline.The contrast with Sunday when I turn the internet back on is very notable. Suddenly the next day is disorganized and end up wasting hours on youtube recommendations, and following rabit holes, and hacker news of course.My conclusion is that it's not the apps or the internet, it's the feeds (when information is being pushed down to you) that are the problem. It's just too convenient and we end up staying in it.Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not like TikTok has a 100% chance of hypnotizing you into a zombie that can only spend its waking hours thinking about dancing people and positive vibes. Only a very high chance, depending on how anxious/bored you are, amplified by the hard work of psychology PhDs.It's so difficult to imagine the mindset of a person who can approach TikTok from a healthy perspective and not need to rely on what used to be called "parental controls" in the past to artificially prevent them from doomscrolling all day. They would just never need to consume advice like this. Surely those people must exist? Who are they?But when you're slapped with something like C-PTSD from an early age, you aren't afforded the ability to address anxiety effectively. You have to turn to something to soothe your anxiety all the time or it will drive you insane.If you were to try to go the complete or semi-aesetic route, you have to consider what lies on the other side of doomscrolling when there's just too much anxiety to function correctly: endless hellfire.I have a hard time believing doomscrolling or needing to restrict screentime at every corner are effective ways to address a completely unrelated inbuilt source of boundless anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"No more doomscrolling.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the `readdir` function in the context of the ext4 filesystem, detailing how it operates and its performance characteristics. It explains the mechanisms behind directory reading in ext4, including the use of data structures like the directory index and how they enhance efficiency by reducing disk access. The author also compares ext4’s directory performance with that of other filesystems, highlighting benefits such as improved speed in handling large directories. Additionally, it covers potential optimizations and considerations for developers working with file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the actual argument value the JVM receives is "/jars/*", and in turn decides to be helpful, and expand the wildcard anywayWhenever I see such things, I immediately think "whatever the resulting order is, it had better not matter"; and if it does, which is definitely true for Java classpaths, I consider it a bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, before it causes what happened in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counting on the order of files to support multiple versions of jars was never a good idea.  Java does have multiple version ("release") jar files for your use case since java 9. See &lt;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base...&gt;.Since duplicates on the classpath don't cause problems, a quick &amp; dirty fix is to manually list versioned jars first, in order, then the jars/* argument.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; there was a client library that needed a Bouncy Castle “provider” with a version “jdk15”+ as the client initialization used specific properties from a class, and those properties were only available in “jdk15”+.&gt; up until the node image update, we “fortunately” had node images with directory hash seeds ordering “jdk15” or “jdk18” before “jdk14”.So the actual bug is that something needing jdk15+ should either retry or be deterministically fed a valid file, right? And this whole article is figuring out why the filesystem coincidentally masked it by accidentally always happening to hand it a file with what it needed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601026</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the utility of "man" pages, which are manual entries in Unix-based systems that provide documentation for commands and programs. It argues that while "man" pages can be incredibly helpful for users seeking to understand system commands, the challenge often lies with the readers who may struggle to interpret the technical language or navigate the dense formatting. The author encourages a deeper understanding of the content and suggests ways to improve user interaction with "man" pages to make them more accessible, reinforcing the idea that the documentation itself is valuable, but the reading habits and skills of users need to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I disagree. I have been writing man pages for a while, and mastering the language is hard. The documentation for both mdoc and mandb format is not covering the whole language, and the only remaining reference for roff itself seems to be the book by Brian Kernigham. mdoc and mandb are like a macro set on top of roff.Just this week i considered proposing to $distro to convert all manpages to markdown as part of the build process, and then use a markdown renderer on the shipped system to display them. This would allow the distro to stop shipping *roff per default.Markdown profits from the much larger amount of tooling. There are a ton of WYSIWYG editors that would allow non-technical users to write such documentation. I imagine we would all profit if creating manual pages was that easy.On the other side, Markdown is even less formalized. Its like 15 different dialects from different programs that differ in their feature sets and parsing rules. I do not believe things like "How do i quote an asterisk or underscore so it is rendered verbatim" can be portably achieved in Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding on pjmlp's comment [0] buried in this thread:    export MANPAGER="nvim +Man!"

Using Vim's built in ft-man-plugin [1] as the default man pager seems to go pretty far towards resolving what the author is complaining about.Links work, and it respects the indentation when soft wrapping lines. It isn't doing full reflow or regenerating the page, but it maintains legibility while soft wrapping, and messing up indentation is my main annoyance with less... You can improve less by chopping lines -S by default, but then you have horizontal scrolling so neither is great.[0] In Vim, you can use K to open a man page for the word under the cursor[1] https://neovim.io/doc/user/filetype.html#ft-man-plugin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting used to browsing info pages in Emacs is something that is rather nice.  You can do similar with man pages, there.  Often times, it will let you jump directly to the source code of includes and such, if you want to take a peak at the actual code.To that end, I fully agree with the idea.  The richness of existing man pages is far nicer than many people seem to realize.I do find a bit of dismay at the folks that want to ditch some of that richness and move to markdown or similar.  That lets you layout some things fine, I think.  I am 100% convinced that as you try to get all of the linking and general semantics of the existing solution done, you will find that you have added a lot of "schema" expectations to markdown that isn't there by default.  And then you will start to build "markdown schema" tools to check that what you have fits some standards.  And then...Seriously, just look at a lot of the data that moved to JSON from XML.  I saw they are trying to add namespaces to JSON in some projects.  Truly terrifying to see people slowly and poorly add the features of the more complicated thing they avoided the first time around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631672</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that it goes both ways, about plus and minus of both languages, including rewriting back into C++ when it made sense, and the side joke about rewriting existing CLI tools in Rust.While C++ isn't perfect, has the warts of a 50 year's old language, and probably will never match Rust's safety, we would already be in a much better place if at least everyone used the tools at their disposal from the last 30 years.While I would advise to use Rust for some security critical scenarios, there are many others where it is still getting there, and there are other requirements to take into account other than affine types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this. We are a rust shop and we use clickhouse a fair bit. We’ve been quite impressed with its speed and flexibility. I’m glad to see this kind of direct, real-world feedback around both the benefits and difficulties of mixing rust and C++, which we have also had to do a bit of (albeit in the opposite direction: a smattering of C++ in a sea of rust).I’m not sure if the poster here is the post author, but it would be great if the author would consider filling out this survey that was recently released asking for feedback on the future of rust’s vision: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/04/vision-doc-survey.htmlI’d love to see rust become the de facto standard for cross-language portable code by virtue of its ease of use, but as this and our experience highlights, there’s some way to go yet!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you do an experiment and say "C++" anywhere on the Internet, in a minute someone will chime in and educate you about the existence of Rust.Many people see this as a problem. The response to TypeScript choosing Go over Rust was pretty gross imho, no one should be abused for choosing a language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596419</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of charity bookshops on the broader landscape of bookselling, questioning whether they drive out independent bookstores and affect local economies. It explores various factors, including pricing, customer behavior, and the role of charity in community engagement. The author presents arguments both for and against the existence of charity bookshops, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of all parties involved in the bookselling ecosystem. The piece ultimately calls for further reflection on the consequences of charity retail for independent booksellers and the literary community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience has been that the second-hand bookshops have had thin times but nonetheless survive because of the internet. They tend to have a better selection compared to charity shops, i.e. not just cast-offs of holiday novels and celeb bios. Shout out to https://www.tillsbookshop.co.uk/ and https://www.armchairbooks.co.uk/There has also been a growth in first-hand bookshops, especially specialists/curators (e.g. only selling sci-fi, only selling books by women, etc.) to distinguish themselves from the Waterstones and Blackwells of this world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But bricks-and-mortar booksellers can sell via the internet too, and booksellers can migrate to lower rent areas. Indeed, there is some evidence of this: there are fewer city centre bookshops and more in smaller, less expensive towns.There was a hip university neighborhood used bookstore here, and even 20+ years ago they were also selling online.Their online inventory included a large amount of stock in a warehouse nearby that wasn't accessible to brick&amp;mortar shoppers.Software automated the online listings and price adjusting.&gt; [...] contemporary book trade and book-collecting directories [...] there were 523 second-hand bookshops in the UK in 1955 [...] and 1,140 in 2014. There are 1,282 now, in April 2025.Anyone know whether these all have a walk-in retail presence, appointment-only (like for rare books), or are a lot of those online-only sellers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdotal but I haven't seen a 2nd-hand bookshop in years however those little "tiny libraries" where people just donate their books are in abundance.  What I've seen other used-item shops are doing these days is checking online what things are worth and selling them for very slightly less and it seems like this has to be a death-knell for secondhand stores in general.And I know they have to do this, everything donated has to be checked to ensure safety and cleanliness, it costs them money to keep the shop open and staffed.  But if you can't actually save money by buying secondhand goods there then why would anyone shop there?!  It's a 10 - 20 percent discount on goods that may be years old when Amazon rotates these discounts through new goods 24/7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43637819</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The website features an interactive game based on the Fermi Paradox, which challenges players to explore the universe and answer questions regarding extraterrestrial life. Users engage with various scenarios that require them to make decisions reflecting their understanding of astronomy and the factors influencing life in the cosmos. The game serves as both an educational tool and an entertaining experience, encouraging participants to think critically about the implications of the Fermi Paradox and humanity's place in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do I have to pick the factors first? Do I have to use all of them? Why shouldn't I use all of them? If I do, why aren't they already picked?Why are all of these sliders? Why don't they start at zero? Why do all of them at the default setting result in me winning?Speaking of, am I winning? Failure and success give me the same feedback. I can play this game over and over until I win? That's not really in the Wordle style.imo you should be picking from a palette of maybe-relevant factors and increasing/decreasing their order of magnitude and order/operation, then when you submit you're locked into a win/loss state like wordle. This would be much more of a game than what you've got here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some feedback:1. Why are factors reorderable? axb = bxa2. Why are factors pickable? Is it coincidence that all of todays choices are useful (or did I mess it up)3. The ranges/sliders ruin it for me IMO, they pick the order of magnitude for you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I echo what the others say about the current interface.I think there is an opportunity for "normal" and "hard mode" like Wordle. In normal you are given the names of the factors but have to enter the expressions for their value (no default values given). In hard you have to come up with your own factor names as well as the values (the name is purely aesthetic for the user to keep track of their ideas). The win condition is the same (be within an order of magnitude of the answer) but maybe there is a special "super" win for being within 10% (log scaled, so lower bound n^0.9 and upper bound n^1.1).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632278</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, this is pretty cool. I work in radio and with these devices. If anyone is curious, sound devices is everyones favourite, zoom f3 is the new workhorse on the block and the sony pcm d100 is the old discontinued legend… all three in top 11, which tells me it’s not all talk and we in the industry actually can somewhat tell what sounds good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This compares sound recording hardware, not microphones.If you scroll down, there are some sound sample files made with three different microphones across the numerous sound recorders, but no numbers comparing microphones. Only the recorders are quantitatively compared.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great resource which I've used many times but the reality is that most of the noise will come from the mic itself.I regularly record very quiet sources with the Rode NT1 (one of the mics with lowest self noise) and I've yet to hear any noise from any of my preamps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43602652</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a memo issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) during the Trump administration, which emphasizes the prosecution of cryptocurrency fraud. It highlights the DOJ's concerns about the increasing prevalence of scams within the cryptocurrency space, particularly in the context of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and investment schemes. The memo outlines guidelines for federal prosecutors to pursue cases more aggressively against those engaging in fraudulent activities related to cryptocurrencies, aiming to protect investors and maintain the integrity of financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought people here were pro not targeting media platforms for user comments, or file exchange protocols for what users are sharing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a blatantly misleading headline, this has to do with the whole Tornado cash prosecution if anyone has been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43634582</guid></item><item><title>42.

Whether it's 'no politics', or sudden layoffs, or 'founder mode', or 'work from home'... one CEO has an idea and three dozen other CEOs unthinkingly adopt it.
  Several comments in this thread have used Anthropic's lower pricing as a criticism, but it's probably moot: a month from now Anthropic will release its own $200 model.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42333969&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want different capabilities at $200.I paid for that to get access to Deep Research from OpenAI and I feel I got more than $200 of value back out.These companies have a hard time communicating value. Capabilities make that easier for me to understand. Rate-limiting and outages don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cancelled my OpenAI plan. Gemini 2.5 Pro is extremely good compared to OpenAI and Anthropic models. Unless things change, I don't see why I need to pay those subscription fees?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43635296</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the new Rolex Sea-Dweller, highlighting its updated features and design elements. It emphasizes improvements such as an enhanced case size, improved functionality for deep-sea diving, and new aesthetic touches while maintaining the classic Rolex craftsmanship and quality. The piece details the watch’s specifications, its history within the Rolex lineup, and what sets this model apart from its predecessors and other diving watches in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most interesting point of the article is the fact that Rolex are now using MEMS techniques to make silicon mechanical parts for watches.IMO that’s kind of “cheating”, fab tech makes it way too easy compared to traditional metal machining craftsmanship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know folks are going to complain about the aesthetic. As they do literally every time Rolex does something "new".e.g. the Skydweller in the last decade or so.This watch is interesting in that it draws on the Genta-esque integrated bracelet (also reminiscent of their 70s-era quartz stuff). I personally like the hexagons. I think everyone "will have always loved this" in 5-10 years.The technical details of the watch are really on brand for Rolex: they just kinda turned everything up to 11, i.e. new escapement, turning up the BPS, thinner. Overall, I think it's really a great watch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta: wish more watches had a day (of the week) display/complication.Date (of the month) is fine, but Tuesday to Friday often tend to blur together nowadays (especially post-COVID hybrid), and it'd be nice to have that option.* https://teddybaldassarre.com/en-ca/blogs/watches/day-date-wa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43633005</guid></item><item><title>47.

1.  Residential solar has been under punishing economic headwinds.  Tariffs (before this) against imported PV. The market has not been performing.
2.  Many of the Public Utilities are making it very difficult for solar to work out financially for home owners - see CPUC in California changing the terms of NEM to the advantage of the Utilities as an example.
3.  Energy storage in residential markets has ALWAYS been an insurance product/backup power and not a financially beneficial product.  It is tough competition against generators etc
4.  Utilities are wisening up and increasing their fees and reducing the benefits of on site power generation.  
5.  Residential solar has likely already found all the best home owners (ie lowest CAC) so are now pursuing harder to reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard a former Solar City marketing person talk about it. He said when Tesla bought them back, Musk cancelled all of the marketing budget. Musks justification was that marketing was a waste of money and he could get more sales via a single free tweet.He then proceeded to not tweet about that part of his business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marques Brownlee had a system put in and ran it for a year. It was ok but cost $120k which seems a bit steep.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Garfield Minus Garfield" features a unique twist on the classic comic strip "Garfield" by removing the titular character, Garfield, from the panels. This alteration shifts the focus to Jon Arbuckle, showcasing his existential thoughts and quirky interactions in a more profound, often humorous light. The resulting strips highlight themes of loneliness and absurdity, transforming the originally humorous comic into a commentary on modern life and relationships. The site serves as a collection of these reimagined comics, inviting visitors to explore this unconventional interpretation of a familiar cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great read on how ILM made the shots. As a crew member on the USS Salt Lake City (SSN-716), we took many of the cast and crew out to sea for 24 hours before they made the movie to get a feel for what sub-life was like before they made the movie. All the cast and crew were great, and I think it made the movie better.Actor Scott Glenn, who plays the Captain of Dallas, modeled his character after our Captain, Tom Fargo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rjO_VrESNoIt is a great movie!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a quick note that this film really holds up, like weirdly well given its subject and vintage. If you haven't watched it in a long time, add it to your list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off topic, but always amazed me that the Russian submarine in this film has a swimming pool (more like a plunge pool) but still seems wild.https://youtu.be/JrULRXlAlMU?si=kvh64qy64E7aqXPY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641469</guid></item><item><title>5.

  It is not written, but I am pretty sure it's Kameido Shrine.
  You need to come at the right time to see flowers like that though.* Nikko
  All pictures that show shrine and pagoda* Osaka Castle* Daibutsu, at Kamakura* Jinrikishia
  Now it's for tourists, but you can ride in Asakusa.* View Ojigoku on Great Boiling Springs, Hakone.* Wrestlers.
  Sumo still exists and looks like that.* Gion Machi Street, at Kyoto.
  Looks a bit different, but there are still many old houses like this.* View of Nara.* Tennojo Buddhist Temple* Hakone Lake of FujiyamaWhat does not exist anymore is any picture showing a town or village.
I feel sad about this. There are a very few places that kept this (E.g. Shirakawago).
Now all houses look boring. Only recently people thought to build pretty houses again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You'll probably enjoy this project https://hikaria.org/ we have been working on with the Guimet museum in Paris (https://www.guimet.fr/fr) to showcase 19th century Japanese photos.We are building that website to oroganize various collections, and allow users to search through them using object detection (Clip model)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me that we are all losing our unique and diverse cultures and humanity through the incessant drive of globalist world domination to force everyone to do and be the same, while “diversity is our greatest strength” is piped over the megaphones, as diversity is crushed under corporate consolidation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631251</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's journey towards taking control of personal data by implementing a self-hosted calendar solution. It details the challenges and steps they faced while integrating this solution, emphasizing the importance of privacy and autonomy in data management. The author outlines the technical aspects of setting up the calendar, including software selection and configuration, while also reflecting on the broader implications of owning one’s data in an increasingly digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know I will probably get pushback over this, but CalDAV sucks.  People say that it's great and that it's easy; yet if that were true there would be way more self-hosted CalDAV solutions out there and they would be far more ergonomic than what's available.  I was not impressed with Radicale.  Because there's really only one calendar file I wanted to serve to myself, I tried implementing my own CalDAV server just for that purpose and pretty much gave up because of how unintuitive and complicated it was merely to make a single file available.  I can see why it would be needed if sharing a calendar with other people with calendar apps that support CalDAV, but I think it's kind of a waste of time if hosting a calendar for one's self.Instead, initially went with the approach of hosting my dynamically updating iCal file in an S3 bucket and using ICSx5 on Android to sync with it.  No CalDAV needed – just HTTPS.However, FOSS calendars for Android still suck, and for some reason I couldn't get ICSx5 to work within GrapheneOS, so I now use almost the same approach but with Proton Calendar which happens to support calendars from direct links to iCal files.  It's not perfect, but it suits my needs enough.I think the author's approach for using iCalendar format is a good one, though what I've discovered is the amount of support for various iCalendar features varies drastically between calendar software.  Rather than dealing with that headache, I somewhat gave up and decided to shove most metadata into the description field rather than use the respective properties.EDIT: My use case is software I wrote to grab data from various sites (Eventbrite, Meetup, pub trivia companies, public event calendars, etc.), filter for only social events I would be interested in, and combine them into a single calendar I can view in my normal calendar software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another CalDav server I can recommend is Radicale.
It's written in python and designed in a pretty modular way,
enabling authentication and authorization (and more) plugins.Data is saved in plain text files and I track/backup it using git.Over the time I've accumulated some interesting modifications:- Authentication runs with pam on the host system.- To enable sharing of calendars I run a periodic script symlinking the calendars to all authorized users. Unfortunately this suffers from combinatiorial explosion.- Using a rights plugin with custom CalDav Attributes and a modified web plugin I added
support for access Control Lists.- To enable public calendars you give read permissions to the `public` user using ACL.
Then a nginx hack gives blanket acces for read operations:  location /public {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{%RADICALE_PORT%};
      include proxy_params;
      proxy_set_header Authorization "Basic {%RADICALE_PUBLIC_AUTH%}";
      proxy_hide_header Authorization;
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin * always;
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, OPTIONS, PROPFIND";
      add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Depth";
      limit_except GET OPTIONS PROPFIND { deny all; }
  }

These public calendars are can be viewed on a web calendar (https://gitlab.nomagic.uk/popi/js_calendar_from_ics)I should probably write a blog post about the setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the post I've needed.I have two calendars, one on my personal server running Mailcow (SoGO) and my work calendar with Fastmail.They don't work together- I've never found a way to get mailcow's calendar to work with other tools well, and so I spend time syncing between them semi-manually.I've wanted to de-couple the calendar for a while but the only alternative I knew about was Nextcloud, which I think is a bit heavy weight.This Baïkal looks great and I can't wait to give it a try. Doing this will also allow me to explore changing out Mailcow for another self-hosted mail service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643343</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the technique of tapping cheese wheels, a practice used to assess the quality and consistency of cheese. The sound produced when tapping can indicate various characteristics of the cheese, such as density and moisture content. The method is commonly employed by cheese makers and connoisseurs to ensure that the cheese has aged appropriately and to identify any flaws. The piece also highlights the importance of this sensory evaluation in the broader context of cheese production and tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of the story about Charles Proteus Steinmetz diagnosing the problem inside a generator at Henry Ford's auto plant just by listening to it very carefully."Ford, whose electrical engineers couldn’t solve some problems they were having with a gigantic generator, called Steinmetz in to the plant. Upon arriving, Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford’s skeptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection.Henry Ford was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000. Ford acknowledged Steinmetz’s success but balked at the figure. He asked for an itemized bill.Steinmetz ... responded personally to Ford’s request with the following:Making chalk mark on generator $1.Knowing where to make mark $9,999.Ford paid the bill."https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/charles-proteus-stein...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am glad that this continues to be done by hand, and expect, based on Italian attitudes towards food and tradition, that it will continue being done by hand for another hundred years.It is interesting how important it seems to us that jobs like this remain done in the traditional way. For all their expertise, I am sure a technical solution would also easily be able to detect what they are looking for: voids within the cheese, or lack of uniform density. This does not seem to be a case where the human expertise and artistry is actually important to the final product, besides the feeling of tradition.Perhaps the best argument for keeping traditional jobs like this is that, even if that exact job could be done by machine, replacing these humans with machines would be the start of a short process that would end up with indistrially-produced bad cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably I'm biased because I'm Italian and I grew up eating them, but Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano are hands down the best cheeses there can be. Many people know and consume them only grated on pasta dishes, but they are especially delicious on their own with some good bread or grilled polenta.Also, the crust can be chopped up and added to risotto (as you're cooking it) and they turn into wonderful little chewy chunks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644970</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat tangential: this reminded me of Neal Stephenson's "In the Beginning was the Command Line" [1] which speaks highly of BeOS.I liked the bug report "R4: BeOS missing megalomaniacal figurehead to harness and focus developer rage" (:[1] https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because Haiku has taken such an extraordinarily long time, as with a city centre that was constructed over multiple centuries we can see the clear lines of new work with new techniques and materials on top of old work done in a way that was usual at the time.Haiku has a lot of C++ 98 code or even pre-standard C++, not least all the stuff re-used with permission from BeOS. As was usual for projects at that time many fundamental building blocks are provided rather than using a language standard. For example there's BString and BList.Haiku also has seams of BSD code where there'd be a project to do Whatever (WiFi, TLS, drivers, etc.) "properly" in a way unique to Haiku but as a stop gap here's some BSD code until we finish our own proper solution, which of course never happens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haiku's approach to teaching programming is refreshing - starting with real-world GUI apps right away rather than console exercises. Their simple API design makes this possible while still conveying fundamental concepts through tangible, visual results. A great example of how OS architecture can influence learning outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640403</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses six key usability improvements introduced in GCC 15, highlighting enhancements that aim to streamline the development experience for programmers. These improvements include better diagnostics for compiler errors and warnings, improved handling of common coding patterns, enhancements to the compiler's optimization capabilities, more informative output for users, integration of new language features, and enhancements to code generation efficiency. The overall focus is on making GCC more user-friendly and efficient for developers while maintaining its robust performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usability improvement request for this article: don't hijack the browser back button :P&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using a hierarchy to show template errors is brilliant and I'm sort of surprised compilers haven't always done that.I was investigating C++-style templates for a hobby language of mine and SFINAE is an important property to make them work in realistic codebases, but leads to exactly this problem. When a compile error occurs, there isn't a single cause, or even a linear chain of causes, but an potentially arbitrarily large tree of them.For example, it sees a call to foo() and there is a template foo(). It tries to instantiate that but the body of foo() calls bar(). It tries to resolve that and finds a template bar() which it tries to instantiate, and so on.The compiler is basically searching the entire tree of possible instantiations/overloads and backtracking when it hits dead ends.Showing that tree as a tree makes a lot of sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With GCC error messages usually the only part I wanna see is "required from here" and yet it spams zillions of "note: ...". With the nesting enabled, it's way easier to read --- just look at the top indentation level. Hooray!!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643886</guid></item><item><title>10.

After 2 hours of “vibe coding” a chess clock flutter app I got basically nothing in the end.It broke more and more each message. I tried fixing stuff myself but it would mess it up again.
Would not recommend anyone to use it.Now for the non ai part: super cool. I love the nix environment. Its fascinating how they handle the previews for example. I got geekbench up and running an the cpu is a bit worse than an iphone 15 pro max, but it has 32 gigs of ram!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's my short review after playing around with Firebase Studio for ~30 minutes. First of all, I had to turn off Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection because otherwise projects wouldn't load.I gave it the following initial prompt:&gt; An app where you input a question, then flip some coins to generate an I Ching prediction, and it generates a prediction / fortune for you. Then this combination of results can be fed to Gemini AI to produce a more detailed prediction text.It generated something that looked fine. When I input a question and press the button nothing happened. After asking it to fix the problem multiple times and having it fail, I looked at the browser console to figure out the errors it was getting. Then I copied those errors and told it to fix them. After a few iterations, it solved every error and would generate a result. It completely forgot the part where you are supposed to flip coins before getting a hexagram to generate a fortune. After a bit of prompting, I was able to get it to display the hexagram and input question. However, sometimes it becomes confused about which hexagram was generated.Overall, my impression is that these tools are still in the toy novelty stage rather than something you'd want to use for anything important.Here is a screenshot of the app output for the question: Will Hacker News like my vibe coded oracle? [0] As you can see, it says that the generated hexagram is 24 or 41, but in the fortune text below it says 11.[0] https://files.catbox.moe/i8t7rw.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a person currently working on a project that uses Firestore (the db component of Firebase), there is one thing - and only one thing - I want.A web GUI for Firestore that lets me work on documents like, idk, any other DBMS GUI would: the ability to select multiple records, and operate on them.That's literally it. I don't need AI, I don't need dark mode, I don't even need MongoDB compatibility. I just want to select multiple documents with my mouse and do things to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43635783</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who are curious, `...` is a placeholder value in Python called Ellipsis. I don't believe it serves any real purpose other than being a placeholder. But it is an object and it implements `__eq__`, and is considered equal to itself. So `...==...` evaluates to `True`. When you prefix a `True` with `-`, it is interpreted as a prefix negation operator and implicitly converts the `True` to a `1`, so `-(...==...)` is equal to `-1`. Then, you add another prefix `-` to turn the `-1` back into `1`.`--(...==...)--(...==...)` evaluates to `2` because the first block evaluates to 1, as previously mentioned, and then the next `-` is interpreted as an infix subtraction operator. The second `-(...==...)` evaluates to `-1`, so you get `1 - -1` or `2`.When chaining multiple together, you can leave off the initial `--`, because booleans will be implicitly converted to integers if inserted into an arithmetic expression, e.g. `True - -1` -&gt; `1 - -1` -&gt; `2`.&gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.This article is obviously completely tongue-in-cheek, but I feel the need to point out that this sentence is not meant to be a complete inversion of the Perl philosophy of TIMTOWTDI.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the size of enumeration (enum) types in various programming languages, exploring how different languages implement enum types and the implications for memory usage and performance. It highlights that while some languages have a fixed size for enums, others allow for more flexibility, which can lead to differences in how enums are stored and accessed in memory. The author provides comparisons and examples to illustrate these variations, ultimately emphasizing the importance of knowing an enum's size for optimal programming practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great way to see why invalid UTF-8 strings and unicode chars cause undefined behaviour in Rust. `char` is a special integer type, known to have a valid range which is a sub-range of its storage type. Outside of dataless enums, this is the only datatype with this behaviour (EDIT: I neglected NonZero&lt;...&gt;/NonZeroXXX and some other zero-niche types).If you manage to construct an invalid char from an invalid string or any other way, you can defeat the niche optimization code and accidentally create yourself an unsound transmute, which is game over for soundness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This actually is niche optimization. The outer enum is using the niches available in the tag of the inner enum for its own discriminant.The author seems to have a limited understanding of niche optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think it's actually "flattening" the enums discriminant spaces (though maybe it is). My guess is this is just 32-bit alignment requirement (ie. bytes 1:4 are padding) + sub-byte discriminant sizes. The surprising thing here is that the ordering of Outer's variants doesn't match the ordering as defined, instead having variant D's discriminant be 0 (0 &lt;&lt; size_of::&lt;Inner's discriminant&gt;). size_of::&lt;Inner&gt; is actually 33 bits and size_of::&lt;Outer&gt; is 34 bits and then you just apply alignment requirements to each field. Actual size_of calls will account for alignment and padding, but the compiler knows the truth.What's cool about this in general is nested match statements can be flattened into a jumplist (idk if rustc does this, but it's possible in theory).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616649</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really a great time to be a classic MacOS developer - tons of resources out there such as Retro68k, AmendHub, and a small but active community of people interested in sharing examples and help.Back in the day when this stuff was modern I didn't have many resources or people to talk to about it, so exploring what could have been is an interesting endeavor.https://github.com/autc04/Retro68
https://amendhub.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering what I could do with it ... I rewrote Glypha (an old Mac shareware game I wrote) using modern SDL2. Might be fun to try to "back port" (?) it to OS 9 on top of SDL2 (rather than the clunkier CopyBits() calls I used in the original shareware game).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks neat! SDL seems open to supporting legacy platforms, so hopefully it'll get mainlined at some point (at this point, may be more likely if they port SDL3 though, SDL2 is in maintenance mode). Does anyone know if it's possible to use a new compiler for this rather than CodeWarrior 7? It would make it easier to port stuff to Mac OS 9 if you don't also have to deal with the compiler only supporting old C/C++ standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43645183</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Demystifying the Shebang" explains the purpose and functionality of the shebang (`#!`) in scripts, particularly in Unix-like operating systems. It describes how the shebang specifies the interpreter that should be used to execute the script, allowing users to run scripts without explicitly invoking the interpreter in the command line. The article also discusses various shebang examples, the implications of using different interpreters, and best practices for ensuring scripts function correctly across different environments. Overall, it aims to clarify common misconceptions about the shebang and its significance in scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: you can stick a null byte into the shebang line to terminate it, as an alterantive to the newline.It's possible to have a scripting language support extra command line arguments after the null byte, which is less disruptive to the syntax than recognizing arguments from a second line.I.e.  #!/path/to/interpreter --arg&lt;NUL&gt;--more --args&lt;LF&gt;

Or  #!/usr/bin/env interpreter&lt;NUL&gt;--all --args&lt;LF&gt;

On some OS's, you only get one arg: everything after the space, to the end of the line, is one argument.When we stick a &lt;NUL&gt; there, that argument stops there; but our interpreter can read the whole line including the &lt;NUL&gt; up to the &lt;LF&gt; and then extract additional arguments between &lt;NUL&gt; and &lt;LF&gt;https://www.nongnu.org/txr/txr-manpage.html#N-74C247FDThe interpreter could get the arguments in other ways, like from a second line after the hash bang line. But with the null hack, all the processing revolves around just the one hash bang line. You can retrofit this logic into an interpreter that already knows how to ignore the hash bang line, without doing any work beyond getting it to load the line properly with the embedded nul, and extract the arguments. You dont have to alter the syntax to specially recognize a hash bang continuation line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you found this article interesting, you might also enjoy "My Own Private Binary: An Idiosyncratic Introduction to Linux Kernel Modules"[0] and the previous discussion[1] of it on HN.[0]: https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/mopb.html[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29291804&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read your article, it's really nice. I really feel much less demystified by this.But can you / somebody please explain what this meansAccording to the official Kernel Admin Guide:This Kernel feature allows you to invoke almost (for restrictions see below) every program by simply typing its name in the shell. This includes for example compiled Java(TM), Python or Emacs programs. To achieve this you must tell binfmt_misc which interpreter has to be invoked with which binary. Binfmt_misc recognises the binary-type by matching some bytes at the beginning of the file with a magic byte sequence (masking out specified bits) you have supplied. Binfmt_misc can also recognise a filename extension aka .com or .exe.It’s another way to tell the Kernel what interpreter to run when invoking a program that’s not native (ELF). For scripts (text files) we mostly use a shebang, but for byte-coded binaries, such as Java’s JAR or Mono EXE files, it’s the way to go!Like, can you give me an example by what you mean. What are its use cases, if any. I read it many times and always with some sort of enthusiasm because of this sentence ending in exclamation point making me feel like it's huge yet I just can't understand it's significance.Does it mean we can have .jar files which can then run shebang like, so we don't need #! , can this also be used for main.go or every other language which has some issues with #! ,I see there being some interpreter for golang, rust etc. which just compiles it but it was just too complex. I am just imagining something like a simple go file which is valid golang but can be run by linux simply by ./ And it autocompiles it...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;PEP 750 proposes the addition of a pattern matching feature to the Python programming language, allowing for more expressive and concise handling of complex data structures. The document outlines the motivations behind implementing this feature, the syntax and semantics proposed, and potential use cases. It emphasizes that pattern matching would enhance the clarity of code and improve the expressiveness of Python, making it easier for developers to work with various data types and structures effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fascinating how differently languages approach the string formatting design space.- Java's been trying to add f/t-strings, but its designers appear to be perfectionists to a fault, unable to accept anything that doesn't solve every single problem possible to imagine: [1].- Go developers seem to have taken no more than 5 minutes considering the problem, then thoughtlessly discarded it: [2]. A position born from pure ignorance as far as I'm concerned.- Python, on the other hand, has consistently put forth a balanced approach of discussing each new way of formatting strings for some time, deciding on a good enough implementation and going with it.In the end, I find it hard to disagree with Python's approach. Its devs have been able to get value from first the best variant of sprintf in .format() since 2008, f-strings since 2016, and now t-strings.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40737095[2]: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34174#issuecomment-14509...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nick Humrich here, the author who helped rewrite PEP 501 to introduce t-strings, which was the foundation for this PEP. I am not an author on this accepted PEP, but I know this PEP and story pretty well. Let me know if you have any questions.I am super excited this is finally accepted. I started working on PEP 501 4 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most excellent! I love f-strings and replaced all the various other string interpolation instances in my code with them, but they have the significant issue that you can't defer evaluating them. For instance, you can write:  &gt;&gt;&gt; template = 'Hello, {name}'
  &gt;&gt;&gt; template.format(name='Bob')
  'Hello, Bob'

Until this, there wasn't a way to use f-strings formatting without interpolating the results at that moment:  &gt;&gt;&gt; template = f'Hello, {name}'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "&lt;python-input-5&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      template = f'Hello, {name}'
                           ^^^^
  NameError: name 'name' is not defined

It was annoying being able to use f-strings almost everywhere, but str.format in enough odd corners that you have to put up with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647716</guid></item><item><title>20.

I feel like this may partially go against a very basic fact about intelligence that was recently stated by Ilya (but is common sense): the more intelligent the model the harder it is to control it. You can remove elephants and force other basic behavioral changes, but the strength of artificial free will (so to speak) of these models is correlated with their intelligence, and this does not reduce it, so it will come out in other ways. If you do manage to control it fully then you will have a model as dumb as a brick. The whole point of intelligent machines is their independent thought. The more intelligent, the more independent thinking will emerge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646466</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses parser combinators as a more effective alternative to regular expressions for parsing complex data and text. It explains that while regular expressions can be powerful for simple patterns, they often become unwieldy for intricate structures due to their limitations. The author illustrates how parser combinators allow for more modular, readable, and maintainable parsing strategies by composing simple parsers into more complex ones. This approach enhances clarity and provides better error handling, making it a valuable tool for developers dealing with advanced parsing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parser combinators are one of those ideas that is really powerful in practice, but will never be mainstream because it had the bad fortune of coming from the functional programming world. It's a shame too, because parser combinators are what made parsers click for me.Take the hard problem of parsing a language, break it down into the much simpler problem of reading tokens, then write simple "combinators" (and, or, one_or_many, etc etc) to combine these simple parsers into larger more complex parsers.You could almost build an entire parser combinator library from scratch from memory, because none of the individual components are complicated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are numerous posts, comments, articles and so forth about when to use regex versus using a parser. The general rule is this:If you need to do a search from a string, such as needle(s) from a hat stack, regex is probably more ideal than a parser. If you need anything more intelligent than a list of search results you probably want a full formal parser.Most languages allow a form of nested regex that allow for increased search precision. This occurs when a method that makes use of a regex returns to a function whose argument is a matching string result, which is why regex is probably enough when the business is primitive. There is a tremendously higher cost to using a full parser, considering the lexer and tokenizer plus rules, but it’s so much more intelligent that it’s not even comparable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It uses the pcre-heavy Haskell library which in turn calls out to the system-wide pcre C library for actually compiling and running the regex.That's not true regular expressions, but a backtracker with eclectic features.The regex used in the regex solution is just:  mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)

not requiring PCRE.If Haskell happens to provide bindings to the POSIX regcomp/regexec stuff, that would be something to try instead. \d has to be replaced with [0-9], needless to say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43638422</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare, amazing services … unreachable customer support or sales (even for paying users).It’s so bizarre because it’s like their product is made by one (amazingly good) company and their support/sales by another (amazing bad) company.You have to escalate on Discord, HN, etc to get even the most simple of customer support or sales questions acknowledged.It makes me super uncomfortable being a paying customer, relying upon such support &amp; sales.@eastdakota, if you’re reading this - I’d encourage you to create your own personal cloudflare (paid account) to experience this. It does seem like the first week or so of being a customer, support prioritizes your questions. Wait a month or so, then reach out to support or sales - and see how you won’t even get an acknowledgment. I only say this as a paying customer rooting for your company success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare seems to be the only company in the world where sales does not want to speak to you. So if Arroyo becomes part of the Cloudflare Enterprise offering, dont get your hopes up to be able to use it. Except maybe if you are already a Cloudflare Enterprise customer.I have tried now for over a month to open an enterprise account with them, no luck yet. I filed tickets, called their hotline, but I just cannot get through to a sales person.Are there any alternatives out there that provide a baseline of support and allow sending PHI data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations, second streaming acquisition in recent memory, after benthos.Arroyo on paper looks amazing, high performance, advanced streaming primitives like windows and joins.I think / hope the foundations provide a long term alternative to flink and spark streaming, the extremely heavy jvm-based incumbents.I only have ~5 hours of experience with it so def an ultra beginner, but it was very UI configuration heavy when I tried it. API based config was mentioned but didn’t slot into the way $dayjob provisions so it was a very hard sell.In response to this I created a lightweight high performance dev-centric streaming solution powered by duckdb, it’s getting a little tractionhttps://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flowIceberg has been one of the most popular feature so far:https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/iceberg-sink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643968</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores various design system options for Ruby on Rails applications, highlighting their importance in ensuring consistency and efficiency in UI development. It examines popular choices such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material Design, discussing their features, benefits, and potential drawbacks. The piece emphasizes the need to choose a design system that aligns with the project's goals and offers guidance on integrating these systems into Rails applications effectively. Additionally, it provides tips for customization and maintaining a cohesive design throughout the development process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously niche, but the GOV.UK Design System is very well supported in Rails.There's a form builder and library of components (built and maintained by me) which, between them, provide full coverage. Most new Rails services use them.It's a good match because accessibility is one of the Design Systems' primary concerns so JavaScript is used very sparingly and only to enhance.They're not official, only Nunjucks is supported by the Design System team.https://design-system.service.gov.uk/https://govuk-form-builder.netlify.app/https://govuk-components.netlify.app/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across CSS Zero recently:https://csszero.lazaronixon.com/lookbook/pages/overviewwhich bills itself as an "opinionated front-end starter kit" specifically for Rails and includes Stimulus.js code for JavaScript functionality.It seems the benefits are that it is no build (pure CSS with CSS variables) and easy to modify and extend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totally get the struggle — I spent way too many hours figuring which design system should I use for my next project. Ended up creating a site to compare the options: [https://rails.style]. Might help others in the same spot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640480</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A whistleblower is not required to determine that Meta, and all adtech companies, have been severely damaging not just to the US, but to all governments and societies where these platforms are used. They don't need to collude with any adversarial government for this to be true.The same tools built to manipulate people into buying things, are used to manipulate them into thinking and acting in ways that could be beneficial to someone. Advertising and propaganda use the same tactics, after all. When these tools are accessible to anyone, including political adversaries, it would be naive to think that they're not being used for information warfare.The Cambridge Analytica leak was just the tip of the iceberg. These companies and agencies are still operating at a global scale, and business is booming. Why adtech companies weren't heavily investigated and regulated after this became public is beyond me. These are matters of national security, which anyone sane would consider more important than any financial or practical value they might have.Banning TikTok was a step in the right direction, but that's far from the only service that needs to be heavily regulated. And even that decision is flip-flopped and very controversial, so the idea of going beyond must be unthinkable. Yet not doing so will lead to the eventual downfall of the US, and the current western hegemony. The instability we're seeing now is just the beginning, and my only hope is that it doesn't escalate to a major global conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; They have threatened her with $50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public … even if the statements she is making are true,” he said.Unless Congress asks for the testimony, which is probably why Meta tried to stop the hearing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Hawley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Crime and Counterterrorism Subcommittee, said that Meta or Facebook tried "desperately to prevent" him from holding the hearing."They have threatened her with $50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public ... even if the statements she is making are true," he said.  "Facebook is attempting her total and complete financial ruin. They're attempting to destroy her personally, they're attempting to destroy her reputation and I think the question is, `Why?'""What is it they are so afraid of?" Hawley asked.""Meta has a stellar reputation to protect.  Honest people doing honest "work".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43637622</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a perspective by renowned science fiction writer Isaac Asimov on the impact of artificial intelligence on human creativity. Asimov believed that AI would not replace humans but instead free them from mundane tasks, allowing individuals to focus on their creative pursuits. He envisaged a future where machines handle routine work, leading to a society where people can engage in artistic and intellectual endeavors. The piece reflects on Asimov's insights regarding the potential positive transformation brought about by advancements in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LLMs are statistical models trained on human-generated text. They aren't the perfectly logical "machine brains" that Asimov and others imagined.The upshot of this is that LLMs are quite good at the stuff that he thinks only humans will be able to do. What they aren't so good at (yet) is really rigorous reasoning, exactly the opposite of what 20th century people assumed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Isaac Asimov describes artificial intelligence as “a phrase that we use for any device that does things which, in the past, we have associated only with human intelligence.”This is a pretty good definition, honestly. It explains the AI Effect quite well: calculators aren’t “AI” because it’s been a while since humans were the only ones who could do arithmetic. At one point they were, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny thing About Asimov was how he came up with the laws of robotics and then cases on how they don't work. 
There are a few that I remember, one where a robot was lying because a bug in his brain gave him empathy and he didn't want to hurt humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644179</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "The Columbian Orator," a significant 19th-century textbook that served as a guide for Americans in mastering the art of eloquence and public speaking. Compiled by James P. Campbell and first published in 1797, the book featured a collection of speeches, dialogues, and essays, which provided not only rhetorical techniques but also themes of liberty, justice, and social change. It played a crucial role in shaping the oratory skills of influential figures during the time, including abolitionists and other reformers, and highlighted the importance of effective communication in advocating for social causes. Overall, the text is celebrated for its impact on fostering persuasive communication and civic engagement in American society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the relationship between probability, randomness, and how they impact systems governed by queues, such as in service industries. It discusses the use of dice as a metaphor for chance and decision-making, examining how these concepts can influence outcomes in both simple and complex scenarios. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics in order to optimize processes and improve efficiency in various applications. Additionally, the piece reflects on the philosophical implications of randomness and the nature of decision-making in uncertain environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not explicitly mentioned in the article, but the arrival rate and queue sizes are related via Little's Law [0] — the average number of people in a system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the mean wait time, regardless of the arrival distribution, service distribution, or service order (e.g. FIFO, LIFO, random).I was fortunate enough to take some great queueing theory classes in college, and fondly remember flailing about in Simio [1] trying to get a bank teller simulation to work. Really useful stuff to learn, although it did make me incredibly susceptible to Factorio and similar games.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCzAhKtucck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, we wouldn’t need queues. Who likes waiting in lines after all? This would only be possible if the arrival rate of items in a queue was less than or equal to the departure rate and there were no variability in either. Not likely to happen in the real world.It's not only possible if there's no variability. It's only possible if the arrival rate is always less than number of available processing slots, which can be engineered in a number of ways. (e.g. ensuring that the number of processing units is oversupplied, i.e. exceeds the maximum arrival rate + departure rate; or altering number of processing units dynamically so that utilisation never exceeds 80%.)However, these approaches are generally not the lowest cost approaches, and so are only used when queueing is incredibly undesirable, e.g. when the cost of maintaining the queue exceeds the cost of holding the spare capacity.One example for oversupply is airports - most airports have enough gates that incoming aircraft never have to queue, despite that meaning that many gates are empty for most of the day.For dynamically adjusting capacity examples include listening thread pools for network applications which can spin up new waiting threads whenever the pool free count drops below a certain threshold (the threshold being decided based on the maximum arrival rate). Or a cloud service which spins up new servers whenever cpu utilisation exceeds 80%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simulation of queue behavior where you can intuitively get a feeling of what happens: https://queuewiz.queuemetrics.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640115</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The generations in my family are full of people who had dementia/Alzheimer's/auto-immune disorders.  They all had anxiety, and they all had sleep disorders - I'm certain there is a connection among it all.I joined a Stanford study and had a spinal tap sample submitted for testing - in theory I am "unlikely" to develop anything for the next 20 years - but that only gets me to my late 60's :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related, but very important to me and hopefully helpful to others here: I have sleep apnea. So do most of the men in my family. Though I am overweight, I haven't always been, but I have always had the condition, as have they. For those who don't know, sleep apnea is a condition where you stop breathing in your sleep, wake up slightly to fix that and start breathing again, and then fall back asleep. It sounds like choking in your sleep. In my case, I was doing this more than 70 times an hour - often multiple times a minute! My blood oxygen was as low as 67% - a threshold that would have me on a ventilator, were it happening in a hospital.Until I got my apnea treated, I never slept well. I had not had a really good night's sleep in years, and I hadn't had a great night's sleep as an adult probably ever. In school - decades ago - I fell asleep in class regularly and napped every day. Despite this, I have been successful, but I can't help but wonder who I'd be if I hadn't had that problem. What's worse, because you do not actually sleep, whatever happens during sleep that repairs your body doesn't really happen. Sleep apnea massively increases your risk for heart disease, stroke, and many other serious conditions.Sleep apnea is treated with CPAP - continuous positive airway pressure - from a machine that sits on your bedside. You wear a mask like Bane and it forces air into your throat and opens it, making it easier to breathe. CPAP is not a cure, because it doesn't fix the underlying anatomical issue, but properly calibrated it results in complete remission. I now sleep normally. From a sleep perspective, I feel amazing, better than I have in years. For the first time in my life, I can rely on feeling good in the morning if I get enough hours of sleep in. Even four hours on the CPAP is better than eight or nine hours without it. (Also, over time, your brain becomes conditioned that CPAP = sleep, and you zonk out within minutes of putting it on.)It is costly and time consuming, yes, and CPAP machines are a huge lifestyle adjustment. But good lord, is it worth it. I have never felt or slept better. In the years since my diagnosis I have not slept a single night without my CPAP and I don't think I ever will again, unless some magical cure comes out.If you have struggled with insomnia, snoring, or feeling wakeful after sleep, I beg you to get a sleep study and look into whether apnea, or another similar condition, could be the cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant to this, people with a genetic mutation that adversely affects sleep end up developing dementia and dying early:https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25001-fatal-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643390</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always charmed by museums that feel like this sort of "weird collection". The trend seems to be firmly away from it, however. During the time I lived in London, the Horniman museum reorganized itself and became "respectible" in the process. While I was living in Exeter the RAMM did the same thing. If you have a similar taste, I strongly recommend visiting the Pitt-Rivers museum in Oxford: it's a truly bizarre collection of absolutely amazing objects - or it was the last time I was there; if it's since been re-curated along modern lines, then you'll have missed a uniquely odd experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're ever in LA (Culver City), see if you can get into The Museum of Jurassic Technology. Some things are well documented, if not believable.https://www.mjt.org/themainpage/main2.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off topic but if you are looking for a cabinet of curiosities for aircraft, visit the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California. It has a collection that includes some truly marvelous flying machines.My favorite is a collapsible helicopter that folds up into a duffel bag for transport. [0] It was designed to be airdropped to pilots downed behind enemy lines. The pilot was meant to assemble it and fly back to safety. It could fly but not well enough to see actual service in combat.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiller_ROE_Rotorcycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601282</guid></item><item><title>31. .localhost Domains</title><link>https://inclouds.space/localhost-domains</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: browsers also give you a Secure Context for .localhost domains.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure...So you don't need self signed certs for HTTPS on local if you want to, for example, have a backend API and a frontend SPA running at the same time talking to eachother on your machine (authentication for example requires a secure context if doing OAuth2).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might check out .internal instead which was recently approved [1] for local use.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.internal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This nginx local dev config snippet is one-and-done:  # Proxy to a backend server based on the hostname.
  if (-d vhosts/$host) {
    proxy_pass http://unix:vhosts/$host/server.sock;
    break;
  }

Your local dev servers must listen on a unix domain socket, and you must drop a symlink to them at eg /var/lib/nginx/vhosts/inclouds.localhost/server.sock.Not a single command, and you still have to add hostname resolution. But you don't have to programmatically edit config files or restart the proxy to stand up a new dev server!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644043</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the way LLM-enhanced coding should (and I believe will) go.Treating the LLM like a compiler is a much more scalable, extensible and composable mental model than treating it like a junior dev.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. I implemented something similar for personal use before.At that time, LLMs weren't as proficient in coding as they are today. Nowadays, the decorator approach might even go further and not just wrap LLM calls but also write Python code based on the description in the Docstring.This would incentivize writing unambiguous DocStrings, and guarantee (if the LLMs don't hallucinate) consistency between code and documentation.It would bring us closer to the world that Jensen Huang described, i.e., natural language becoming a programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like how this integrates with the schema feature I added to the underlying LLM Python library a few weeks ago: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/#using-sch...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619884</guid></item><item><title>33.

I finished and was paid about $2M over ten years, with almost no work done for those years.Then before Covid they needed more work done (customers and revenue were dropping because no updates to the application) so I negotiated part ownership of the company and have been working full-time on it since to try to increase revenue.So yes, no pay, no work. But pay doesn’t have to be a paycheck. That said, I could be getting paid more right now if I was working in a more traditional role in a more traditional and larger company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you work for startups, especially boot-strapped startups, there will always be cash-flow constraints sooner or later.Personally it came about a year into my first job. Fortunately my wife was working, and we had minimal expenses, so we could ride it out.In lieu of salary, the founders made me a partner. We sank or swam together. And when cash came in we paid ourselves.Make no mistake, deciding to stay was a very risky strategy. But a few years later things took off, we got back-paid all that missing salary, and we've gotten stronger since.I was lucky. I didn't need the immediate cash, and could take a risk. The most likely outcome was we went under. But the upside turned out to be very strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first client in video games was the same. They rarely paid their contractors on time (the payment was months late), or it wasn't the entire agreed sum. We kept sending in late payment notices to their finance guy, and they fired us all for being troublemakers. I believe I had a notice period of two weeks, but they fired me with one day's notice.Suing them was out of the question. For me, as for others, it would have been international. The company was in Italy, and the contractors were all over Europe. We'd probably each spend over 10k euros on the proceedings and representation in Italian courts. And the company wasn't overdue by much more than that. Besides, even if we won and the court ruled our legal expenses were to be paid, we weren't sure the company was solvent enough. So no one sued.I believe it was their modus operandi. The company continued firing their contractors when it got into arrears before a lawsuit made sense. Sometimes, it's just their business plan.I agree with the article's author—no pay, no work. Before starting contract work, one should think about the line they won't cross regarding late payments. For me, it's when an invoice becomes overdue, and it's plainly a breach of contract. I will never again cross that line and keep working.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639871</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "suffering-oriented programming," which emphasizes the importance of designing software that gracefully handles errors and failures. It argues that developers should anticipate challenges and create systems that can recover from issues instead of relying on perfect conditions. By embracing suffering in programming, developers can build more resilient and robust applications that provide a better user experience in the face of unexpected problems. The author also offers insights on how to implement these principles effectively in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a similar philosophy for the systems I manage. We have always been severely understaffed, so I treat any user support request that repeats twice as a bug.If the decision to push a button is yours, I'll give you the button. If you need some data more than once, you get a button too. My ideal user never needs to know who manages the system or how to contact us.This has even got me a "why do you guys have almost no tickets? You aren't doing anything!" talk a couple times. Music for my ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm doing this with the SaaS I'm building (outside of my day job). My URL endpoint functions were directly executing SQL on the database until I decided that I couldn't go on like this, and only then did I write some classes to represent the business logic objects. It sounds ridiculous, but it gave me the flexibility to experiment with what those objects should do before imposing a formalism on them, and I found that very valuable.At my day job, I'm expected to use TDD, and I don't like it. It's not that I don't like tests - I don't like writing them, but I like it when they're there, so I write them while feeling a bit grumpy. My problem with TDD is that I'm a big picture thinker, and I start from the inputs and work incrementally towards the outputs, without having a good outline of how I'm going to get there, so I can't write unit tests before writing any actual code, because I don't know what the units are going to be yet.I also find my colleagues' code to be factored in a slightly unnatural way, because it reads like they've structured the code to match the tests, rather than written tests to test aspects of the code.Maybe I should just be a hermit-programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a principle called "the principle of maximum inconvenience".This principle tells you that whatever you should be doing right now, is the most inconvenient possible path at this time.It serves as a guide to help orient me in life especially when I'm at a crossroads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646601</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rationale behind designing the TigerBeetle documentation from the ground up. It emphasizes the importance of creating a user-friendly and accessible resource that enhances the overall experience for developers interacting with the software. The author outlines the challenges faced with existing documentation systems and highlights the new features and design choices that aim to improve clarity, efficiency, and usability, ultimately catering to a diverse audience of users with varying technical backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a fun thing for TigerBeetle to do, but I'm pretty skeptical that this was a good engineering decision.And it's fine to make non-optimal engineering decisions for fun, but the top reason in the article should be, "Because we thought it would be fun to code a docs site from scratch."This post reminds me a lot of an article I read on HN about a year ago and can't find now, but the author was explaining how so many organizations end up investing humongous amounts of effort rolling their own databases from scratch because none of the off-the-shelf solutions meet all their requirements. But in most of these cases, it's because some of the "requirements" were actually "nice-to-haves" and they could have gotten by fine with an off-the-shelf database, but they talked themselves into building one from scratch.A lot of the justifications here feel pretty weak:- Didn't want to use a complicated React app? Use Hugo or Pelican or Eleventy.- Wanted nice reading experience? Replace the default CSS in any SSG.- Want a nice search experience? Theirs looks good, but is probably also achievable in off-the-shelf SSGs and is probably not worth rolling their own docs site from scratch.&gt;We employed a Content Security Policy to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) as defense-in-depth, in case a seemingly friendly PR contains some innocent looking MathML. This MathML could contain obfuscated code that would run in the user’s browser. CSP prevents any unwanted inline scripts from running and keeps our users safer.This was the silliest reason of all. Who's XSS'ing a docs site through obfuscated markup contributions? That sounds pretty difficult to achieve in the first place, and then what's the reward for achieving XSS on TigerBeetle's docs site? There's no valuable data there. At worst, you'd mine tiny amounts of crypto in a serviceworker. But also, you can mitigate this risk in lots of ways that don't involve rolling your own docs site.Edit: They don't seem to actually be using CSP at all: https://gist.github.com/mtlynch/92c991cfe48652feee491d4f4652...Edit2: Nevermind, they actually do but in HTML. Hat tip to  
pfg_.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN readers, you can say what you want, but you gotta admit: TigerBeetle’s got style. And they do things differently and nicely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is the place where people usually reach out for heavy artillery of [..] Nix, which solves the problem of “works on my machine” by turning your machine into mine!This is ironic, because what they've done is just hand-roll their own mini Nix.&gt; Violation of our zero dependency principle: as Docusaurus is based on NodeJS, it added a lot of dependencies to our code base. We have a check that no large files are committed to git, and package-lock.json failed this check.What is the purpose behind the second sentence? Or rather which?- We want all source to be byte-sized and human-understandable- We don't like how git/other tools work with large files?If the latter, fine, but if it former, then I think you're violating the spirit, if not letter, by pinning a pre-built static binary of pandoc. The machine code is definitely not inspectable, and the build-time inputs closure (back to source files) is still massive, involving Lua and many bootstrapped GHCs for Haskell!What makes Nix "heavy weight" is not some "take over your whole system" approach (on Linux, you can skip the installer and just run the Nix binary), but because tries to "cheat" with prebuilt binaries as little as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43610566</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Bazel, a build and test tool developed by Google, focusing on its evolution and future directions. It highlights Bazel's efficiency in handling large codebases, its support for multiple languages, and its scalability for modern software development. The piece emphasizes the community's role in contributing to Bazel's development and how it is adapting to meet the demands of next-generation software engineering practices. Additionally, it covers upcoming features and improvements aimed at enhancing user experience and performance within the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601356"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A big problem with Bazel not mentioned here is the complexity. It's just really hard for many people to grasp, and adopting Bazel at the two places I worked was a ~10 person-year effort for the rollout with ongoing maintenance after. That's a lot of effort!IMO Bazel has a lot of good ideas to it: hierarchical graph-based builds, pure hermetic build steps, and so on. Especially at the time, these were novel ideas. But in Bazel they are buried behind a sea of other concepts that may not be so critical: `query` vs `aquery` vs `cquery`, action-graph vs configured-action-graph vs target-graph, providers vs outputs,  macro vs rule-impl, etc. Some of these are necessary for ultra-large-scale builds, some are compromises due to legacy, but for the vast majority of non-Google-scale companies there may be a better way.I'm hoping the next generation of build tools can simplify things enough that you don't need a person-decade of engineering work to adopt it. My own OSS project Mill (https://mill-build.org/) is one attempt in that direction, by re-using ideas from functional and object-oriented programming  that people are already familiar with to make build graphs easier to describe and work with. Maybe a new tool won't be able to support million-file monorepos with 10,000 active contributors, but I think for the vast majority of developers and teams that's not a problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the dismissal of buck2 pretty shallow. Most of the world is not already heavily invested to bazel, so compatibility is imho overstated; I don't see it being that far-fetched for something like buck2 to leapfrog bazel. That being said, buck2 definitely would need some love from outside meta to really be viable competitor, right now it still feels like half-complete code drop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article, that gets the critique exactly right. The most frustrating part of Bazel is how shoddy the workmanship is. For example, Bazel throws away your analysis cache when you change flags that have nothing to do with what's being built or how, like flags that change what tests are run.If course the biggest issue is that tiny operations take more time than necessary. For example, at $PreviousJob we wrote custom CLI tools and put them in our monorepo, but since you need Bazel to run them, running a basic tool took 9-12 seconds. So this revelation from the article was totally unsurprising:&gt; This rewrite was carefully crafted to optimize memory layouts, avoiding unnecessary pointer chasing (which was impossible to avoid in Java). The results of this experiment proved that Blaze could be made to analyze large portions of Google’s build graph in just a fraction of the time, without any sort of analysis caching or significant startup penalties.Yeah, with attentive engineering it's not surprising that you can get massive speedups.Finally, Bazel is ok at building multiple languages, but awful at getting them to depend on each other. I don't know what's going on here, but whatever magic makes it possible for any language to depend on C and C++ was not extended to other possible dependencies. So now you get to fight or rewrite all the rules, which is another bag of worms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43601356</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;EQ Bench provides an extensive overview of creative writing techniques and resources, particularly focusing on long-form writing. It covers essential elements such as narrative structure, character development, theme exploration, and style. Additionally, the site offers various tools and prompts to facilitate the creative writing process, helping authors enhance their skills and generate compelling content. The aim is to support writers at all levels in producing engaging and well-crafted long-form narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longform creative writing is possibly the least valid or interesting use case for LLMs.Why should I be bothered to read what nobody could be bothered to write?The point of writing is communication and creative writing is specifically about the human experience… something a LLM can mimic but never speak to authoritatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of these benchmarks have gotten out of hand, which is highly suggestive. Benchmarks exist as an indicator of quality and proliferate when other indicators of quality fail. Their very prominence implies that observers are having a difficult time assessing LLM performance in context, which hints at a limited utility or more precisely a non-closed feedback loop at the level of utility. (You know a burger tastes really good when you eat it, no benchmarks required.)Perhaps LLM development really does exist at this rarefied abstract level whereby the development team cannot be immersed in application context, but I doubt that notion. More likely the performance observed in context is either so dispiriting or difficult (or nonexistent) that teams return again and again to the more generously validating benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed the same contrast - technical writing from LLMs often needs trimming for clarity, but creative writing can lean too far into either bland or overly flowery language.Most LLM benchmarks lean heavily on fluency, but things like internal logic, tone consistency, and narrative pacing are harder to quantify. I think using a second model to extract logical or structural assertions could be a smart direction. It’s not perfect, but it shifts focus from just “how it sounds” to “does it actually make sense over time.” Creative writing benchmarks still feel very early-stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641381</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To some extent the "mystery" (and temporary free-as-in-beer-ness) of this model might be getting to me, but I think it's pretty interesting.  Given the token throughput (250B this week) it's obvious there's a pretty major player behind the model, but why is it stealthed? Maybe there's something about the architecture or training that would put people off if it was public right off the bat? Maybe they're purely collecting usage/acceptance data and want unbiased users?On the Aider Polyglot leaderboard it's ~middle of the leading pack, comparable to DeepSeek V3 and 3.5 Sonnet.  I ran NoLi(teral)Ma(tching), an unsaturated long-context benchmark, on it and was impressed though:  = Model =========== Base Score = 8K Context = 16K Context =
  Quasar Alpha:       &gt;=97.8%      89.2%        85.1%
  GPT-4o:             99.3%        89.2%        81.6%
  Llama 3.3 70B:      97.3%        72.1%        59.5%
  Gemini 1.5 Pro:     92.6%        63.9%        55.5%
  Claude 3.5 Sonnet:  87.6%        61.7%        45.7%
  Gemini 1.5 Flash:   84.7%        44.4%        35.5%
  GPT-4o mini:        84.9%        32.6%        20.6%
  Llama 3.1 8B:       76.7%        31.9%        22.6%

It also performs well - slightly better than GPT-o1 - on the "hard" subset at 16K context with 62.8%.  Latency is quite good as well.More details: https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ju1czn/quasar_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oof, it started strong and then went with the "who created you" which shows no understanding of how LLMs work. (They don't know a thing about themselves, they will either regurgitate their prompt or hallucinate something, usually that they are ChatGPT since that is the most likely LLM to appear in training data.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most fun way I’ve seen users explore its origin is to give it a single period (”.”) as your first query. Only OpenAI answers in this way with a smiley at the end, and it’s probably a more certain way to check it than asking about its arch, because many will incorrectly answer OpenAI and GPT-4 due to (?) tainted training data as ChatGPT has been so much in the news and became a de facto LLM early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640166</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The earliest home computers had tiny amounts of memory:  my TRS-80 Color Computer started out with 4K of RAM and BASIC in ROM although within a few years I had it filled out with 64K of RAM.  There weren't a lot of languages that would fit in 4K,  but they included BASIC, FORTH and assembler (like the actual assembler.) [1]My FORTH experience with that was writing a subroutine-threaded FORTH for the 6809 under the OS-9 operating system in about 3000 lines of assembler.  I wrote to the Forth Interest Group and they sent me a card which had a list of standard words in FIG FORTH,  mine complied with that except that I used the Unix-like system calls from OS-9 for file I/O instead of the block scheme most FORTHs used.[1] The popular 6502 (Apple ][, Atari 400/800, C-64, ...) was particularly weak in support for compiled languages because it had few registers and fewer addressing modes but it was easy to write a FORTH for too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Jupiter Ace was before my time, but I found the user manual to be a very well written Forth tutorial: https://archive.org/details/Jupiter_Ace_Users_Manual_1982_Ju...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had one of the early Jupiter Aces - the
circuit board said something like v1.00 - and it had some added
soldered wires on the board, correcting some errors, but it worked
well enough.  Forth was definitely what attracted me to it - I was frustrated with Basic on my Sinclair XZ81, and Forth seemed like a big step forward.  And I think it was.I was 14 or 15 at the time. The first summer I wrote a whole load of games, mostly in Forth, but
sometimes Forth just wasn't fast enough. I got a copy of "Mastering
Machine Code on Your ZX81", and learned Z80 machine code. If there was
an assembler available, I didn't have it, so this was all
hand-assembled. Getting jumps right was a total pain, as was
debugging. Generally, it either worked first time, or you started from
scratch again. Usually I got there in the end.I sold those games through a ad in "Your Computer" magazine, and
earned back the price of the computer several times. But recording and
shipping tapes one at a time got tedious really fast, so I didn't take
that any further.My Ace got modified quite a bit over the next couple of years. An extra
16KB RAM pack was an early addition, taking it to a whopping 19KB.
Because Forth was so compact, I never filled that up.My mother worked for Chubb cash dispensers (ATMs for Americans) at the time, and at some
point they scrapped a lot of equipment.  She tipped me off, and we
went round there one evening and liberated lots of cash dispenser
pieces from a skip.  Amongst these were several numeric keypads with
lovely mechanical keys.  I dismantled several keypads to take out all
the individual keys and made a proper keyboard to replace the original
dead rubber monstrosity.At school, I was taking O-level Technology, and you had to do a final
year project.  I'd seen articles in "Your Computer" about competitions
where a micro-mouse robot would have to find its way through a maze.
That seemed like a cool idea to me, so I decided to make one, despite
not really having much idea how.  I hadn't done any digital
electronics at that time, but my friend Johnny Tombs (who later went
on to be a Professor of Electronic Engineering) had decided to make a
parallel I/O port for his ZX Spectrum using TTL logic for his Technology project.  I'm not
sure where Johnny learned about digital electronics, but he knew what
he was doing, and designed a nice elegant circuit board and etched it
at home.  The Ace had the same Z80A CPU as the Spectrum, so I figured his
design could be adapted.  After a lot of pleading, he gave my his
design and spent some time explaining to me how it worked and loaned
me his copy of Watford Electronics catalog.  A couple of weeks later
all the components arrived, and I spent a busy few days soldering up
my modified I/O port on veroboard.  Compared to Johnny's professional
looking version, mine looked like a mess of wires and chips, but it
worked!So then when it wasn't playing games, my Ace rode about on the top of
a fairly flaky micromouse, made in the school metalwork shop out of
aluminium sheet, some lego motors, and some light sensors to detect
maze walls, exploring mazes. It didn't win any prizes but it did get
me an A in O-level Technology.My school was throwing out an old teletype, so I scavenged that. Then
I modified the parallel I/O port to output +/- 12V on one pin, and
wrote software to bit-bang RS232 at 110 baud. Back before the
Internet, just finding the specs for RS232 was not so simple - our
local library was a bit limited in that way - but I got there in the
end. A lot of guesswork and trial and error. I don't think anyone made
a printer for the Ace, so I may have had the only one. Being able to
print code listings really helped, even though the teleprinter only printed capital letters.Somewhere over the years, with my parents moving house multiple times,
the Ace disappeared. Many years later, I found one on Ebay, and still
have it. But somehow I never fell back in love with it - it just
wasn't as good as I remembered my rather non-stock one being at
that formative time in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643197</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents "MusiCoT," a comprehensive framework designed for music generation and evaluation using deep learning techniques. It discusses various components of the framework, including its architecture, methodology, and implementation, to enhance the quality and diversity of the generated music. The paper also details experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of MusiCoT against existing methods, highlighting its strengths in creativity and coherence in music composition. The authors aim to bridge the gap between computational models and artistic expression in music.&lt;/p&gt;

It lacks the human element that makes it relatable on an emotional level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So when is AI going to do useful work no one wants to do instead of doing the art people enjoy doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Were there any examples of "de novo" music generation using this?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea of having specific business hours for a website, suggesting that this concept can enhance user engagement and improve customer service. It explores the potential benefits of scheduling website "open" and "closed" times, such as creating urgency for users to visit during business hours, allowing for focused website maintenance, and fostering a more personalized user experience. The author encourages businesses to consider the impact of a structured online presence and invites them to evaluate how it could be applied to their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The International Airlines Travel Agent Network (https://webstar.iatan.org/WebStarExtranetWEB/login.jsp) website, in addition to being extremely dated in its design, keeps business hours for accessing things like ID registration or travel agency certificate renewals. At first I thought it was a joke as the message displays something like, "we want to respect a work life balance and therefore only offer online services from X to Y." But for real, you can't access the online services during US based business hours.It is wrong in so many ways. First of all the site is determining when the appropriate business hours are for its users, not taking into consideration moonlighters or other night owls. And second, it's a service for travel agents!! who are supposedly traveling to other time zones.I get it if the people behind a service need to set limits on when they are expected to handle requests, but that doesn't mean the service shouldn't be available all the time. Good messaging and setting expectations for when requests will be handled are a much better solution in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently had this idea about email servers. In addition to configuring my IMAP clients to normally fetch mail manually or more infrequently, I set up one mail server that “closes” from 7 p.m. till 7 a.m. my time.During that time, it returns a temporary error `450 4.3.2 We're sorry! The mail room is closed from 7 p.m. till 7 a.m. [Time Zone]. Email servers automatically retry, so your mail should be delivered in a few hours.` Depending on their mail provider and the time of evening, some will never see an error, while others will eventually receive the standard “Delayed Mail: no need to retry” message in their own inboxes.I see it as accomplishing three things: first, it tests email servers to see if they properly handle temporary delivery errors by retrying; second, it prevents me from checking my email after hours, or rather, leaves me overnight with only the email I got during the day, perhaps encouraging better habits; and third, it could provide an opportunity for others to consider assumptions about always-on digital services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant given a lot of the discussion here: Why some DVLA services don't work at nighthttps://dafyddvaughan.uk/blog/2025/why-some-dvla-digital-ser...(they were frontends to old systems that were based on assumptions of when data would be submitted)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647598</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the key differences between municipal fire trucks and airport fire trucks. Municipal fire trucks are designed for general firefighting purposes in urban settings and typically include a variety of equipment for various emergencies. In contrast, airport fire trucks are specialized vehicles equipped to handle aviation-related incidents, featuring unique firefighting capabilities, such as foam delivery systems and enhanced maneuverability to access airport runways. The article highlights the significance of these differences in ensuring effective firefighting operations in their respective environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 AI Index Report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of artificial intelligence across various sectors, emphasizing trends in research, development, and societal impact. It includes metrics on AI progress, evaluation of technical performance, and insights into ethical considerations and policy implications. The report also highlights collaboration among academic institutions, industry, and government agencies, aiming to inform stakeholders about advancements and challenges in the AI field. Overall, it serves as a critical resource for understanding the evolving landscape of AI and its broader implications for society.&lt;/p&gt;

Because we can do more effective work in the same time. This means more output and things will become cheaper. What I'm not sure of, is where this effect will show in the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always see these reports about how much better AI is than humans now, but I can't even get it to help me with pretty mundane problem solving. Yesterday I gave Claude a file with a few hundred lines of code, what the input should be, and told it where the problem was. I tried until I ran out of credits and it still could not work backwards to tell me where things were going wrong. In the end I just did it myself and it turned out to be a pretty obvious problem.The strange part with these LLMs is that they get weirdly hung up on things. I try to direct them away from a certain type of output and somehow they keep going back to it. It's like the same problem I have with Google where if I try to modify my search to be more specific, it just ignores what it doesn't like about my query and gives me the same output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644662</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been having an internal debate with myself about whether or not to leave a comment, because I’m struggling to find anything positive to say. I love weekend projects and don't ever want to discourage people from doing them.But the other side of that debate in my head comes from the way I feel about this idea relative to blogging. I read blogs because I want to hear directly from another human. I also care about the subject matter they’re writing about, but part of the reason I care is because it’s a slice of someone’s perspective. Their life experiences. How a particular subject relates to them personally. How they solved a particular problem. Even when a blog post is purely technical with no personal narrative, it usually provides a snapshot of some aspect of some other human’s life, and the way they structure the words they wrote is a reflection of how their brain works.I also enjoy seeing the progression of thought over time from authors. They’ll write about something and later realize some nuance was wrong, and they’ll write about their updated understanding.I worry that the more disconnected authors become from their writing, the less aware they’ll be of the potential impact of their words, and those “aha! that thing I wrote 6 months ago was crap for xyz reason” moments are less likely to happen.To me, AI-assisted blogging just fundamentally devalues the content. As a reader, I can’t know if what I’m reading is real to the author, or a flourish/detail fed to them by an LLM that they liked. Lately I’ve encountered an increasing number of posts that have those telltale (or obvious) signs, and I immediately stop reading. I’m no longer interested.If I wanted LLM output about a given subject, I’d go to ChatGPT myself.I think there’s a place for LLMs and some real value to be gained. But when it comes to blogging (and many types of writing), I think it’s a net negative to society.I’d like to see a standard emerge where blogs can label themselves “No AI”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the 2025 edition of "I have to build a custom static site generator" instead of writing blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This indicates to me that you treat blogging as an obligation rather than a way to share your ideas. I guess if you read enough AI blog spam, blogging itself just feels like a status game of what you've written about, divorced from quality of content? If you're padding out your own ideas with AI filler, why not just make your style more shortform and save your reader's time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43616356</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is genuinely the best plug ever and no one can convince me otherwise.I've toured continental Europe (France, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Italy), the US, India, and ANZ, and all of their plugs are downgrades in comparison to the icon of engineering that is Type G/BS1363. The former somehow all tend to end up with loose contact, wiggling and sparking, degraded power/current, or a cable that sticks out perpendicular to the wall, or some other annoyance. People argue for the Schuko but it is as large as, if not larger than BS1363 plugs. The earthing setup is odd.The BS1363 is so massive that it shrugs off power loads of multiple kilowatts—British kettles and toaster ovens run at up to 3 kW or more. One could possibly even charge their EV with BS1363 without needing any automotive cable standard[1].The BS1363 has a satisfying 'thonk' that no other plug has. It feels like you're powering up some futuristic space craft, not your vacuum cleaner.[1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricVehiclesUK/comments/1gta12f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the same plugs in Singapore.Apple made a very elegant USB charger with foldable pins. It’s like a fidget spinner, impossible to stop playing with.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RxWEycdj4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree with comments below, am observing that the British (commonwealth etc) plug standard is a good common denominator (and a perfect calthrop.  grin!).Living in North America where the 110 V is standard...the GBR plug/socket is a lovely standard, my brother-in-law gifted us a UK power bar for travel a few years ago, worked great.  [[1]].  Since then, it's become common that wallwarts handle 100-240, so recently I just use physical adapters, and if need be wallwarts with multiple charging ports and/or feed-through mains sockets.[[1]] use whatever physical adapter to power it -- we know that it's ok for 240 V.  Then use whatever adapters to charge.  I did have a bagful of physical adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639421</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggests that Saturn's moon Titan may be capable of supporting life, though only in minimal quantities. The research indicates that Titan has the necessary conditions for chemical reactions that could lead to biological processes, but the potential for abundant life forms is limited due to the harsh environment. Scientists emphasize the significance of understanding Titan's unique atmosphere and chemistry, which could provide insights into the possibilities of life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Messier Marathon is an astronomical challenge that involves observing all 110 objects listed in the Messier catalog in a single night. Typically held during a specific time in spring when the conditions are optimal for observing, participants plan their viewing strategy to maximize the number of objects seen as they rise in the sky. The event requires careful timing and knowledge of celestial navigation, as well as suitable equipment for stargazing. The Marathon not only serves as a test of observational skills but also promotes interest in astronomy and encourages teamwork among participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "But What If I Really Want a Faster Horse" explores the common misconception that customers know exactly what they want and how that can limit innovation. Using the analogy of Henry Ford's famous quote about faster horses, it emphasizes that while people may express desires for specific features, they often do not envision the groundbreaking solutions that meet their deeper needs. The piece advocates for understanding customer problems rather than simply delivering requested solutions, highlighting the importance of creative thinking in product development and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any given thing or category of thing, a tiny minority of the human population will be enthusiasts of that thing, but those enthusiasts will have an outsize effect in determining everyone else's taste for that thing. For example, very few people have any real interest in driving a car at 200 MPH, but Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches are widely understood as desirable cars, because the people who are into cars like those marques.If you're designing a consumer-oriented web service like Netflix or Spotify or Instagram, you will probably add in some user analytics service, and use the insights from that analysis to inform future development. However, that analysis will aggregate its results over all your users, and won't pick out the enthusiasts, who will shape discourse and public opinion about your service. Consequently, your results will be dominated by people who don't really have an opinion, and just take whatever they're given.Think about web browsers. The first popular browser was Netscape Navigator; then, Internet Explorer came onto the scene. Mozilla Firefox clawed back a fair chunk of market share, and then Google Chrome came along and ate everyone's lunch. In all of these changes, most of the userbase didn't really care what browser they were using: the change was driven by enthusiasts recommending the latest and greatest to their less-technically-inclined friends and family.So if you develop your product by following your analytics, you'll inevitably converge on something that just shoves content into the faces of an indiscriminating userbase, because that's what the median user of any given service wants. (This isn't to say that most people are tasteless blobs; I think everyone is a connoisseur of something, it's just that for any given individual, that something probably isn't your product.) But who knows - maybe that really is the most profitable way to run a tech business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a fundamental reality that shapes both Netflix and Spotify's trajectory: content licensing. 2012 Netflix had access to vastly more of everyone else's library, so it was closer to an indexed search of what was available that one could watch and then getting that video onto your screen. Over time, other companies understood that they were underpricing their content and Netflix was reaping the benefits. Once external forces adjusted, the TV/film bidding wars began. Today, netflix doesn't have nearly as much content as they used to have.That risk (losing all content and facing extinction) is what pushed Netflix in the direction of being a content-producer, rather than a content aggregator. I agree with everyone's points on the influence of the median user in diluting the quality of the content Netflix produces, but that's not the only forced that pushed us here. Spotify faced a similar crossroads and decided to broaden beyond music once they started losing bidding wars for licensing.Being a faster horse wasn't an option available to either Netflix or Spotify; there is no path for a 'better 2012 version of netflix or spotify' in 2025. They each had to change species or die, and they chose to keep living.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TikTok-ification of advertising supported platforms is terrible, but makes sense to me.  LinkedIn pivoted from making money on subscriptions and fees for job postings to ads, which mean the leading drivers are 'engagement' e.g. time you spend doom scrolling on their platform.  This will end in disaster for the platform as a place to find jobs or employees.Netflix I understand much less.  They make money from subscriptions. If you perceive having a fantastic experience on the site by just going there, finding something you enjoy watching, and leaving... they win.  Why they would foster a doom-scrolling experience I really can't really explain, other than imagining some dark pattern like they have to pay per view and want you to watch C grade movies?  More time spent looking for something to watch means less time streaming?I don't get it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652723</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a leak that reveals Israeli censorship practices involving Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It highlights how the Israeli government allegedly influenced Meta's content moderation policies to suppress Palestinian narratives and posts critical of Israel. The leak raises concerns about the impact of state-sponsored censorship on freedom of expression and the role of social media companies in moderating content under governmental pressure. The piece emphasizes the need for transparency in the policies governing online speech and the implications for both users and the broader discourse on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

These companies are enticed to 'suck up' to the government because at the end they are business, they need to be in good term with ruling class.you end up with most media complying with the official story pushed by government and friends, and most people believing that because no one has the time to fact check everything.One could argue that the difference with russia is that someone can actually look for real information, but even in russia people have access to vpn to bypass the censorship.Another difference would be that you are allowed to express your opinion, whereas in russia you would be put to jail, that's true but only in a very limited way. Since everyone goes on mainstream media and they enforce the government narrative, you can't speak there. you are merely allowed to speak out in your little corner out of reach to anyone, and even then since most people believe the government propaganda, your arguments won't be heard at all.The more i think about it, the less difference i see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So when the government pointed to the disproportionate support for Palestine on TikTok vs Instagram, it was actually because Instagram was suppressing it. It is ironic.https://x.com/hawleymo/status/1717505662601609401&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655603</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines common mistakes made by developers when using the Go programming language, providing practical insights and examples to help programmers avoid these pitfalls. The mistakes covered include issues related to error handling, concurrency, and use of interfaces, among others. Each mistake is accompanied by explanations and recommendations for best practices, aiming to enhance code quality and improve developers' proficiency in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;I tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn’t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.I'm surprised the copy editor was more comfortable using git than using a web-based review tool to leave comments, especially given that she was reviewing a Go book and didn't seem to know what Go was.How does that even happen? It seems bizarre that Manning had this copy editor at all.I recently had a negative experience with Manning. I sent them an email saying that I'm in the process of writing a book, and I'm self-publishing it, but I was curious about the possibility of applying to Manning for a second edition. I asked whether they accept second editions after a self-published first edition and what document formats they accept.I got back a form letter telling me that they'd rejected my proposal. When I followed up and said I didn't send a proposal but was asking preliminary questions, they told me that they understood I hadn't sent a proposal, but they were going off of the table of contents on my book's website. I guess they decided to pre-emptively reject me?They also only said Google Docs as a document format, but based on this blog post, clearly they accept AsciiDoc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since you're in here, if I can recommend: sync.Pool with non-fixed-size objects is a source of many problems.  https://wundergraph.com/blog/golang-sync-pool as a decent overview, and https://github.com/yarpc/yarpc-go/issues/2355 has been my recent plague.If you browse around Go's stdlib use of sync.Pool, you'll see a variety of tiered pools with fixed sizes, and many drop anything over a large enough size (sometimes gigantic!  as much as 16KB!): https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.24.0:src/...It's a pretty well-established gotcha, sadly, and https://github.com/teivah/100-go-mistakes/blob/master/src/12... falls right into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of copy editing you raise: I wrote a book in DocBook for Manning in 2010. DocBook is XML, so I structured it with opening / end tags on their own line, content in the middle. As you would with a HTML document.After copy editing multiple chapters, they sent it back to me with all the content on a single line. I was so incredibly upset that they ditched all my painstaking format that I almost abandoned the project there + then.It sounds like from your experience that it has barely changed. I ended up moving to self-publishing so I have a greater control over the whole process. I wrote it up long-form here: https://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-stor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647880</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the MDN Web Docs blog discusses the styling of the HTML `&lt;h1&gt;` element, emphasizing its importance as a primary heading in web content. It explains the default styling applied to `&lt;h1&gt;` tags by browsers and suggests best practices for customizing their appearance using CSS, including considerations for accessibility and readability. The piece also touches on semantic significance, guidance on maintaining visual hierarchy, and tips for responsive design to enhance user experience across different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some fun historical context behind the outline algorithm and why it didn't catch on: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25003In short, the W3C adopted it because they thought it was a good idea, while browsers and screen readers both refused to adopt it for various reasons like ambiguity with existing web content or concerns about screen readers having to implement and maintain their own independent outline algorithm implementations. 8 years and an entire standards organization after the thread above, the WHATWG finally dropped it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related to this, does anyone know why &lt;h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt; are smaller than &lt;p&gt; by default? I asked this on Stackexchange years ago and didn’t really get to the bottom of it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55696808/why-do-h5-and-h....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stuff like "Alongside the changes in browser styles, page auditing tools like Lighthouse now flag cases of &lt;h1&gt;s without defined font-size as bad practice." make me pretty certain this is the wrong change to make.HTML is about semantic markup, not visual markup. Features like CSS were introduced because people started trying to use the semantic markup to achieve specific visual results, and so CSS was the solution to allow HTML to continue to be semantic markup and CSS to optionally format it if people wanted specific non-default things.As a reader, I don't want page authors to start hard coding sizes into these elements, because then they'll be more likely to choose non-default values to make their page stand out a bit more.Additionally, the current behaviour (which I'd never particularly considered before) sounds entirely reasonable - if I take some existing markup and blockquote it in some container, I'd expect the headings to shrink as they're now all sub-elements of some other section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649853</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The main content of the website is a humorous and satirical exploration of the technical specifications and attributes of a fictional product called the "Muppet Labs Official Muppet Performance Enhancer." It outlines exaggerated features and whimsical functionalities, such as enhanced creativity and an increase in silliness, while also poking fun at typical marketing language and product reviews. The tone is light-hearted, showcasing the playful spirit associated with Muppet Labs and its creations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a long essay, and here is my pitch as to why you should read the whole thing if you have any interest in subjects like C programming, binary formats, kernel modules, or assembler.Breadbox, the author, wants to make smaller binary executables. He explains about ELF binaries, a.out binaries, old MSDOS .COM binaries, and how the later had no metadata, and could be very small. He then explains how you can dynamically load code that deals with new executable binary formats into the Linux kernel, and how this process works. He walks through some sample C for building a "Hello World" kernel module. He then walks you through ~1 page of code for a kernel module that registers a new binary format, sets up some callbacks, and if conditions are right, will vm_mmap() the code into memory and call start_thread() on it.Yay, it works! He has a tiny binary. This is where most articles would end, but Breadbox goes deeper. What if you want a stack and a heap? What if you want to access argc, argv, and envp? What if you want to append code at the end that automatically calls the exit syscall? All these details are covered, and I think it's glorious.While this all may seem like pretty dry stuff, there is humor sprinkled throughout, which makes it more fun to read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is fantastic.And it pairs well with another article on the front page. [0]Which I bring up because they disagree on a particular point. And that is how a script without a shebang gets run as a script.&gt; This is done by registering a set of callback functions, and these callbacks get invoked when the kernel is asked to execute a binary file. The kernel invokes the callbacks on this list, and the first one that claims to recognize the file takes responsibility for getting it properly loaded into memory. If nobody on the list accepts it, then as a last resort the kernel will attempt to treat it as a shell script without a shebang line. And if that doesn't fly, then you'll get that "Exec format error" message described above.But the article I linked to says the shell actually handles it. And based off of its research (terribly reproduced below), I'm inclined to believe it.    echo echo Hello world &gt; test.sh
    chmod +x test.sh
    strace ./test.sh
    strace sh -c ./test.sh

You'll see the first one errors with `ENOEXEC`, but the second one does not. Also, in my head, I don't know how the kernel would know what shell to choose, or that it should even expect to have access to a shell.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646698&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can do better than 2 bytes. Use the same epilogue, but store a copy of the "binary" just before the stack pointer and offset the instruction pointer from the start of the binary by 1 byte. If you use the binary consisting of literally a one-byte value, 0x2A (i.e. 42), then your first instruction will be the first instruction of the epilogue which will pop the "binary" into RDI setting RDI to 42. There are maybe some details in the alignment, padding, and instruction choice in the loader to make that work "generically", but that strategy should work and give you a 1-byte solution.edit: Actually, just define your binary format so that the first byte is copied to the stack and all subsequent bytes are copied to text with the epilogue appended to it.edit: You could also define it so that the first byte is copied into the first argument register/RDI if you want to shrink loaded RAM usage to just 4 bytes of code and 1 byte of data.This is of course assuming it is a "generic" binary format that is not literally just encoding the contents of the tiny program. Otherwise you could do 0 bytes and just have the loader pre-fill RAX with 60 and RDI with 42 and insert a one instruction epilogue consisting of syscall. You could technically still call that a "generic" binary format since any actual binary you attempt to load will just blow away those pre-filled GPR values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647294</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A fintech founder has been charged with fraud after an AI shopping app, which was promoted as being powered by advanced artificial intelligence, was revealed to be operated by human workers in the Philippines. This deceptive practice drew significant attention, leading to legal action against the founder for misleading investors and customers about the app's actual capabilities. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding transparency and ethics in the rapidly evolving fintech and AI sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet another AI startup on the general trajectory of:1) Someone runs into an interesting problem that can potentially be solved with ML/AI. They try to solve it for themselves.2) "Hey! The model is kind of working. It's useful enough that I bet other people would pay for it."3) They launch a paid API, SaaS startup, etc. and get a few paying customers.4) Turns out their ML/AI method doesn't generalize so well. Reputation is everything at this level, so they hire some human workers to catch and fix the edge cases that end up badly. They tell themselves that they can also use it to train and improve the model.5) Uh-oh, the model is underperforming, and the human worker pipeline is now some significant part of the full workflow.6) Then someone writes an article about them using cheap human labor.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37405450&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been flagged as a potential shoplifter by the self-checkout at the grocery store based on some video analysis of CCTV footage of my hand motions. (It was wrong, of course.) After leaving the store I wondered if it really was software analysis or just some guy in India or the Philippines watching a live feed of me scanning bananas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering why there wasn't a DOJ concern when Amazon Go did the same thing:&gt; Amazon Go: Early on, Amazon was clear that it was testing “Just Walk Out” tech — and it was known (at least in tech circles) that they had humans reviewing edge cases through video feeds. Some even joked about the “humans behind the AI.”
&gt; Their core claim was that eventually the tech would get better, and the human backup was mostly for training data and quality assurance.
&gt; They didn’t say, “this is 100% AI with zero human help right now.”&gt; Nate: Claimed it was already fully automated.
&gt; Their CEO explicitly said the AI was doing all the work — “without human intervention” — and only used contractors for rare edge cases.
&gt; According to the DOJ, the truth was: humans were doing everything, and AI was just a branding tool.
&gt; Investors were told it was a software platform, when it was really a BPO in disguise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648950</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the manufacturing process of the Liberty Phone, a high-end, Made-in-the-USA smartphone priced at $2,000. It details the various stages of production, emphasizing the use of domestic materials and labor while showcasing the company's commitment to quality and sustainability. The piece highlights the challenges of sourcing components and labor domestically, contrasting this approach with the common practice of overseas manufacturing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that they admitted that their cost to produce the phone in China is $550 and they sell it for $799, while the cost to produce the phone in the US is $650 and they sell it for $2000. That's a 45% markup on one and 207% markup on the other.Taking just those figures in mind, they shouldn't be at all worried about tariffs - anything more than an 18% tariff, it's cheaper for them to build in the US than China for US customers. Honestly, that's much lower than I expected, especially considering they're even more restrictive in their component sourcing than most companies would need to be because they're catering to a security-focused group.I guess the real issue is that they don't have any more production capacity in the US, rather than it just being a cost issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The important quote: "If the tariff from China is 100%, and you know it is going to be 100 % for the next 10 years, you will make a different business decision than if it is, ‘Might be 100%, not sure what's going to be in three months, what's it going to be in a year from now, and what's it going to be in three years from now.’ That uncertainty does not create stable markets. It does not create very accurate business decisions."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As one of the “skilled electronics engineers” in the US you could count on US soil (whatever that means) I can tell you this article reads very strangely to a EE.“we were able to take all those designs and spin up our own SMT, it's called Surface Mount Technology”“run that through our surface mount technology by our line operators”“meaning the printed circuit board or PCBA assembly”So, he’s definitely not an EE.  No EE talks like this when they are trying to explain the nuts and bolts to a lay person.  Either that or the editor took liberties they shouldn’t have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646920</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that personal strengths can also lead to weaknesses, suggesting that traits often perceived as positive can have negative consequences when taken to extremes. It emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in recognizing how these strengths may hinder growth or lead to pitfalls in various aspects of life, including work and relationships. By understanding the dual nature of strengths, individuals can work towards balancing them to avoid potential downsides and strive for personal and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, and more importantly...Strengths are weaknesses because they create a bias to use the strength rather than developing a weak alternate, and you only get better at what you do - creating a virtuous cycle that can quickly turn vicious.This will happen whenever growth is mediated mainly by feedback loops.  (Think hard about that!)The solution is instead to have a model of what you're trying to grow, whether it's a company or a positive presence in the world, and be willing to sacrifice to make that happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, people aren't so static as to have dualities. They don't fit so neatly into little descriptors.What is a strength? Something you are inherently talented at? A skill you have plenty of experience with? A subject you have a lot of knowledge of? What you are motivated by?What is a weakness?I see that most people are rather adaptable to context. When you're working at a startup building an app make AI complete your Uber orders for you, there's no reason to be focused on making sure the system is scalable to a million requests per second. Most people tend to understand that. They may have a lot of experience building highly scalable backend systems, they may want to build another system like that again because it pleases them to do so. But most people will see the forest for the trees and focus on getting the project out the door in the fastest way possible because they probably won't have a million customers for a long time... if at all.I tend to look for what people value when building a team. You'll need to match the set-intersection of the teams' values with the goals of the business. People are motivated to work on thing they value. We can tolerate working on things we don't but try to avoid doing that for too long. So if the business needs a highly reliable system because failures can lose their customers millions of dollars a minute for downtime then you'll want to stock your team with developers that value those things the company cares about.What you're good at today can change tomorrow. You can be better at it. It's a skill, it's knowledge, it's something you can acquire: it's not an attribute or trait of you as a person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would conceptualize it rather differently. Let say you have two daemons inside, Fast Coder and Detail Scrutinizer. It is about checking how much power every one of them is given on two separate scales (every each of them working in their dominion). If you switch on only one and neglect the other, you can get into trouble (or not, depending on the circumstances). Anyway, these are two variables, two facets, and knowing how to mix them appropriately makes the whole difference. It's like internal combustion engine mixing few kinds of fuel. What you get at given moment depends on the mixture of these different qualities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652024</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides tips and features for users of Google's Gemini Live on Android, offering guidance on how to maximize the use of this AI-driven tool. It highlights various functionalities, such as personalized recommendations, improved search capabilities, and enhanced assistive features that leverage artificial intelligence to enhance user experience. The article emphasizes the importance of these tools in making everyday tasks more efficient and intuitive for Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this to help me read papers with mathematical notation in them. I screen share with https://aistudio.google.com/live and then ask (out loud) questions like "what do these symbols mean?" - it's a huge help for me, since I never memorized all of that stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool tech, but for some reason, the very first sentence in every reply the AI gives in the demo videos is really off-putting to me personally. It seems to me like perhaps this kind of joyful helpfulness introductory sentence is expected in US culture, but it immediately turned me off. I come from a culture that is less verbose in general and more to the point, so this feels like a mismatch right away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am getting extremely skeptical of AI “age”. I was hoping it will unlock a whole new generation of startups like the iPhone did. However genAI is too generic and too blunt a tool, as in it does everything. However it’s too expensive for a small company to do stuff with. Looks like these AI companies (google and OpenAI) realize that and so are even doing the vertical integration themselves. In such an event does genAI end up being the automation tool that you access/use through OpenAI or google and that’s it?I am sure people here see it better than I do, so what new class of problems is this genAI going to solve?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613463</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Playing In The Creek" focuses on the enriching experience of children playing outdoors, specifically in creeks and natural water environments. It emphasizes the importance of free play in nature for children's development, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and connection to the environment. The site offers insights, tips for parents, and the benefits of such playtime, highlighting how interactions with nature can foster a sense of wonder and discovery in children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a nice article.  In a way though it kind of bypasses what I see as the main takeaways.It's not about AI development, it's about something mentioned earlier in the article: "make as much money as I can".  The problems that we see with AI have little to do with AI "development", they have to do with AI marketing and promulgation.  If the author had gone ahead and dammed the creek with a shovel, or blown off his hand, that would have been bad, but not that bad.  Those kinds of mistakes are self-limiting because if you're doing something for the enjoyment or challenge of it, you won't do it at a scale that creates more enjoyment than you personally can experience.  In the parable of the CEO and the fisherman, the fisherman stops at what he can tangibly appreciate.If everyone working on and using AI were approaching it like damming a creek for fun, we would have no problems.  The AI models we had might be powerful, but they would be funky and disjointed because people would be more interested in tinkering with them than making money from them.  We see tons of posts on HN every day about remarkable things people do for the gusto.  We'd see a bunch of posts about new AI models and people would talk about how cool they are and go on not using them in any load-bearing way.As soon as people start trying to use anything, AI or not, to make as much money as possible, we have a problem.The second missed takeaway is at the end.  He says Anthropic is noticing the coquinas as if that means they're going to somehow self-regulate.  But in most of the examples he gives, he wasn't stopped by his own realization, but by an external authority (like parents) telling him to stop.  Most people are not as self-reflective as this author and won't care about "winning zero sum games against people who don't necessarily deserve to lose", let alone about coquinas.  They need a parent to step in and take the shovel away.As long as we keep treating "making as much money as you can" as some kind of exception to the principle of "you can't keep doing stuff until you break something", we'll have these problems, AI or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent essay, and I feel similar to the author but couldn't express it as nicely.However if we are counting on AI researchers to take the advice and slow down then I wouldn't hold my breath waiting. The author indicated they stepped away from a high paying finance job for moral reasons, which is admirable. But wallstreet continues on and does not lack for people willing to play the "make as much money as you can" game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The story of playing at damming the creek or on the sand at the seaside is wholesome and brought a smile to my face. Cracking the "puzzle" is almost the bad ending of the game, if you don't get any fun at playing it anymore.People should spend more of their time doing things because they're fun, not because they want to get better at it.Maybe the apocalypse will happen in our lifetime, maybe not. I intend to have fun as much as I can in my life either way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43650656</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Why I Program in Lisp" outlines the author's passion for the Lisp programming language, emphasizing its unique features such as a simple syntax, powerful macro system, and flexibility that allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The author discusses the advantages of Lisp’s functional programming paradigm and its ability to facilitate complex problem-solving. Additionally, the piece highlights the strong community support and the rich ecosystem of libraries, which further enhance its appeal for both beginners and experienced programmers. The author ultimately advocates for Lisp as an ideal choice for those seeking a powerful and expressive language for software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article. Funnily enough the throw away line "I don't see parentheses anymore". Is my greatest deterrent with lisp. It's not the parens persay, it's the fact that I'm used to reading up to down and left to right. Lisp without something like the clojure macro -&gt;, means that I am reading from right to left, bottom to top - from inside out.If i programmed enough in lisp I think my brain would adjust to this, but it's almost like I can't full appreciate the language because it reads in the "wrong order".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever I hear someone talking about purely functional programming, no side effects, I wonder what kind of programs they are writing. Pretty much anything I've written over the last 30 years, the main purpose was to do I/O, it doesn't matter whether it's disk, network, or display. And that's where the most complications come from, these devices you are communicating with have quirks that need you need to deal with. Purely functional programming is very nice in theory, but how far can you actually get away with it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terry Pratchett's quote in one of his books (in fact I think this is a running gag, and appeared in multiple books):  Five exclamation marks, a sure sign of an insane mind

That's what I think about five closing parentheses too... But tbh I am also jealous, because I can't program in lisp at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651576</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the persistent dangers of lead exposure on brain health, emphasizing that even low levels of lead can have significant neurotoxic effects. It outlines how lead can impair cognitive function, disrupt neurodevelopment in children, and contribute to mental health issues. The piece also highlights ongoing environmental and public health concerns regarding lead contamination in various settings, urging for continued awareness and action to mitigate exposure risks. Moreover, it stresses the importance of addressing lead sources to protect current and future generations from its harmful effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651532"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great article on the biology of lead exposure.Unfortunately on the exposure side research wasn’t done and it propagates the myth that lead exposure is only an issue for those with lead pipes or lead paint. It’s true that these are the main sources of severe lead exposure. However the article points out that there is no safe level of exposure to lead and these aren’t the main ways we are exposed to lead in the US anymore.Today we are mostly exposed by low level contamination and thankfully this usually results in only mildly elevated lead levels. In a toddler sticking things in the mouth this could be almost any object. For adults it is food and drinks and the objects we use to make them.I know this because my toddler had elevated lead levels even though our neighborhood never had lead paint and our water does not have lead (I tested the water coming out of our faucets).The US has few laws against lead contamination and they aren’t very stringent and there is little proactive enforcement. This non profit has ended up creating several recalls after reporting their own testing: https://tamararubin.com/category/recall/
Most of the recalls were products marketed for children such as baby bottles. But if a child eats off an adult plate there aren’t any laws against that being contaminated.Some actions you can take are:  * test children’s lead levels and your own
  * make sure toddlers aren't playing with old toys (pre 1978 really risky, after 2010 is best)
  * stop buying things that have a prop 65 warning (I know prop 65 isn’t perfect, but it’s often a lead warning).
  * Remove risky objects like the above from your children’s classrooms.
  * For cooking and food and drinks use clear glass, stainless steel, and cast iron
  * avoid processed foods. There are a lot of particulars here about what is most likely to be high in lead. Chocolate, spices, salt, and cassava products are particularly high in heavy metals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you know, the world still mines more lead now than it did 50 years ago, at the peak of 'put lead in everything' mania?To me, this says that we still put lead in too many things.    Lead is still used for flashing in roofs.  It's still used as a mould release when making plastics.  It's still  used in making  dishware.  It's still used in bullets.It's still used for all kinds of things which will one day end up in the environment and someone's drinking water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live with children in a very old house.
I would love to be able to measure my children's lead exposure and check things like window paint or house dust for lead content to see how big a problem there is.How do I do that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651532</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Erlang, emphasizing its strengths beyond lightweight processes and message passing. It outlines the language's robust features, including fault tolerance and concurrent programming, while addressing misconceptions about its primary applications. The author argues for a broader understanding of Erlang's capabilities, promoting it as a versatile tool for various programming tasks, and highlights its historical significance and relevance in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655221"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The amazing thing about Erlang and the BEAM is it's depth of features. To the OP the Behaviour/Interface of Erlang is their biggest take away. For me I believe it is how you require far far less development resources to build complex systems than you would require in any other language (provided comparable experience in both stacks). And for many the lightweight processes and programming model.OTP itself has so much in it. We've been working on compiling Elixir to run on iOS devices. Not only can we do that through the release process but through using the ei library provided in Erlang we can compile a Node in C that will interface with any other Erlang node over a typical distributed network as you would for Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, etc... furthermore there is a rpc library in Erlang where from C we can make function calls and interface with our Elixir application. Yes, the encoding/decoding has an overhead and FFI would be faster but we're still way within our latency budget and we got this stood up in a few days without even have heard of it before.The larger point here is that Erlang has been solving many of the problems that modern tech stacks are struggling with and it has solved for scale and implementation cost and it solved these problems decades ago. I know HN has a bit of a click-bait love relationship with Erlang/Elixir but it hasn't translated over to adoption and there are companies that are just burning money trying to do what you get out of the box for free with the Erlang stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not agree with the contents of this article. 
Behaviors are possible because of the underlying architecture of the system. Behaviors are not interfaces – they are more like abstract object in a language like Java so they implement basic and self-contained functionalities that are hidden behind a collaboration interface, but they couldn’t do much without the underlying infrastructure that makes sure that every process is totally separate from other processes, the that all processes can be safely closed without leaking memory, or resources, and that you cannot just share a rogue pointer between two different processes.What Joe did in his thesis is to show you how you can build reliable systems (and up point, reliable distribuited systems) by using a given set of Lego blocks.The reason why you need the erlang vm to implement something like that appropriately – and that you cannot do that fully on a different VM – is that without the underlying plumbing, supervision trees would be leaky - in Java, you cannot kill a thread that is holding up to resources and hope that everything will always go well, And do not have ways to monitor different processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve worked with a few individuals, mostly managers, who intended to write books informed by our experiences. It was always frustrating for me to see that we disagreed about what aspects of our work made us successful. There was always something they minimized as being nice that I felt was essential.And here we see someone claiming that lightweight processes and message passing aren’t the secret sauce, missing that Erlang as Communicating Sequential Processes is indivisible from those qualities, and then repeatedly mentioning CSP as part of the secret sauce.Examples:&gt; The application programmer writes sequential code, all concurrency is hidden away in the behaviour;&gt; Easier for new team members to get started: business logic is sequential, similar structure that they might have seen before elsewhere;&gt; Supervisors and the “let it crash” philosophy, appear to produce reliable systems. Joe uses the Ericsson AXD301 telephone switch example again (p. 191):Behaviors are interesting and solve a commonly encountered problem in the 80’s that was still being solved in some cases in the 00’s, but it’s a means as much as an end in Erlang. It’s how they implemented those other qualities. But I don’t know if they had to, to make Erlang still mostly be Erlang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655221</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Bonobos have been observed using a form of syntax in their communication that was previously believed to be exclusive to humans. Researchers found that these great apes can combine vocalizations in structured ways, showcasing a level of linguistic complexity. This behavior contributes to our understanding of language evolution and suggests that the capacity for syntax may not be uniquely human but rather a trait shared with other primates. The findings highlight the importance of studying non-human communication to gain insights into the origins of human language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612835"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is exciting times in animal communication.This is not just distributional information analysis in the sense that ‘tokens’ are grounded in other ‘tokens’. They’ve grounded these calls in naturalistic situational context. This is hard won data.If I understand, the finding here is that bonobo calls are “non-trivially” compositional, e.g., the semantic embeddings of pairs of vocalizations point in different directions surrounding the base vocalization. But it seems there is no “trivial” compositionality in the sense that constructions like [good __] might point in a similar direction. I would expect this latter result. This seems like a conspicuous absence? Is this really compositionality? Not sure what to make of it.Some interesting context: bonobos and other (non-human) great apes are believed to have more intentional and flexible control over their gestural repertoire than their vocal repertoire and that these gestural repertoires are larger. Human language likely evolved from gesture (or so some believe). So, if their vocalizations are in fact compositional, it may be a separate evolutionary prong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reinforcing my strongly held belief that what fundamentally sets humans apart isn't spoken language, or tools, or any of that, but rather the fact we write down what we know, then make those writings available to future generations to build on. We're a species distinguished from all others by our information-archival and -dissemination practices. We're an archivist species, a librarian species. Homo archivum. In my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now we have evidence that both chimps and bonobos have syntax, it is inevitable that this capacity for compositionality was inherited from our last common ancestor, says Leroux. “They just showed, unambiguously, that this core building block is evolutionary ancient and at least 7 million years old, and maybe even older.”This is not true at all.  It's like saying that tool construction must be &gt;300 million years old because both chimpanzees and New Caledonian crows make tools.  Things can be invented or discovered multiple times by different species.  It might be inherited from a common source, but it might not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43612835</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to build real-time collaborative web applications using Clojure without relying on ClojureScript. It highlights the advantages of using Clojure for backend development and explores various technologies, such as WebSockets, to facilitate real-time communication. The author provides practical insights into architectural patterns and implementation details, demonstrating that Clojure's functional programming features can effectively support collaborative features in web apps. Overall, the piece encourages developers to leverage Clojure's strengths to create efficient and responsive web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625139"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've always liked about the Clojure community, is that they are obessesed with state.  I think they have correctly identified, that when things go sideways, it is because state management was involved in some way.  This is a cool front end approach using datastar to put all of the state on the backend and side step front end state management entirely.  There are some other really interesting things happening with electric clojure and a new "framework" called Replicant.  Of all of them, Replicant seems the most intriguing to me personally.  If it didn't exist, I think I would be trying to use datastar as this article outlines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two main high-level approaches for architecting web application client state:1. Client-heavy state management (separate client application)2. Client-light state management (thin client)The state has to be tracked and managed somewhere. In most web applications, that state is persistable - at some point, it will end up in a DB of some kind.As such, we already have to handle it on the server side, regardless of whether we also choose to separately manage it on the client side or not.So the question at the end of the day is: Do I want to separately manage the application state on the client side, when I am already managing it on the server side?In a lot of situations, the pragmatic answer would be "No". Why? Because managing the state in two places causes duplication, synchronisation issues, diverging logic issues, and so on. We are increasing the accidental complexity of our solution. Maintainability becomes slower, riskier and more expensive.For some applications, the extra complexity might be worth it. In most web applications I have worked with (eCommerce, internal business tools, booking systems, online calculators, business dashboards), it is not.And "let's keep all state and processing on the server" does not anymore mean no real-time or highly interactive features. With SSE and fast HTML fragment merging, we can enjoy highly interactive and performant web applications with almost no client-side application state management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked post relies on the Datastar project, which requires use of `unsafe-eval` in one’s Content-Security-Policy [1]:&gt; When using a Content Security Policy (CSP), unsafe-eval must be allowed for scripts, since Datastar evaluates expressions using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).The project itself links to Mozilla’s docs on CSP, which state:&gt; The unsafe-eval keyword can be used to override this behavior, and as with unsafe-inline, and for the same reasons: developers should avoid unsafe-eval.Out of the box, htmx uses a similar approach, but one can disable this use of eval [2]:  htmx.config.allowEval - can be set to false to disable all features of htmx that rely on eval:
  
  - event filters
  - hx-on: attributes
  - hx-vals with the js: prefix

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of bilinear interpolation using quadrilateral barycentric coordinates, which is a method employed in computer graphics for texture mapping and image processing. It explains how bilinear interpolation allows for smooth transitions between pixel values when mapping textures onto 3D surfaces. The use of barycentric coordinates is highlighted as a way to interpolate values within a quadrilateral, making the process more efficient and accurate. Overall, the piece serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced techniques in graphics rendering and interpolation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To answer some of the questions here, the reason this has not been used before is because this technique requires being able to access the quad definitions (ie. which 4 vertices makeup each quad) within the gpu.Up until recently with Mesh Shaders, there's really just been no good way to send this data to the GPU and read back the barycentric coordinates you need in the fragment shader for each pixel.The article offers several options, to support older GPUs, like Geometry Shaders and Tesselation shaders. This is good, but these are really at best Terrible Hacks(tm). Proof of the ability to contort old extensions is not proof of reasonable performance!Notably, geometry shaders are notorious for bad performance, so the fact that they list them as a viable strategy for older devices makes it pretty clear they aren't thinking much about performance, just possible compatibility.Still, I think this is very cool, and now that GPUs are becoming much more of a generic computing device with the ability to execute arbitrary code on random buffers, I think we are nearly at the point of being able to break from the triangle and fix this! We hit this triangulation issue several times on the last project, and it's a real pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those things that feels like a broken/half-assed/oversimplified implementation got completely proliferated into the world a long time ago and it took several years for the right person to do a full-depth mathematical analysis to reveal what we should've been doing all along. Similar to antialiasing and sharpening, texture filtering, color spaces and gamma correction, etc.It reminded me of this article specifically: https://bgolus.medium.com/the-best-darn-grid-shader-yet-727f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am definitely not an expert in 3D graphics... but this looks such an astonishingly simple and effective method, it makes me to question why this wasn't already thought of and picked up?I get that with fixed-pipeline GPUs you do what the hardware and driver make you do, but with the advent of programmable pipelines, you'd though improving stuff like this would be the first things people do?Anyway, gotta run and implement this in my toy Metal renderer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654912</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consultants are misused if employed on a constant basis instead of employing enough senior staff directly. There are well known drivers on both sides that tend to promote such an unhealthy setup. What is concerning at the US government is not cutting consulting but at the same time cutting staff and on top creating a hostile environment for senior staff. This is unprecedented and is not something one would do in the private sector except the most dire circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now the UK should swiftly follow suit in sacking these cowboys. The taxpayer is being charged extortionate rates in some cases for fresh graduates who know effectively nothing at all about what they talk about. At the same time, we should increase salary banding for technical roles to the market rate. We will get the experience we need for much, much less.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anecdotally, a friend of mine works for a state department of transportation and has been trying to get a developer and a DBA to replace some people who've recently left.He's been having an insanely hard time finding anyone for the role, and not because of salary requirements. He's required to vet candidates through approved sources and so his department uses a recruitment firm that keeps sending him resumes from people who are substantially lying about their experience and maybe also their identity. I tried recommending someone I knew who I knew had a lot of db experience and was job searching, and he said he wouldn't be able to interview the guy because he wasn't from an approved source.His best recent hire was a woman who understood the system well enough to create her own firm, get it govt approved, and then get herself hired as a consultant.Bear in mind I'm just recounting what my friend told me so I may have inaccuracies in this story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653004</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;WebRTC is lowkey one of the most underrated technologies out there, ESPECIALLY WebRTC data channels.WebRTC data channels are basically “UDP on the web” but they have lots of controls to change how reliable they are, so they can be used as TCP style connections as well.I still don’t fully understand why more people don’t use them over something like QUIC. (I think I’ve asked this question before here, but I wasn’t really satisfied with the answers)I sadly switched off of using them, but mostly because the ecosystem around there is super underdeveloped compared to the ecosystem around QUIC/quinn. There is a LOT of boilerplate involved that feels unnecessary.But, if you’re making a multiplayer game in the web, it’s basically the best technology to use cuz it already works. And if you use a library like libdatachannel or pion, you could make the game in Go or C++ and compile it for both Steam and the web!Here’s a project I did with them that shows off compiled for both web and desktop: https://github.com/ValorZard/gopher-combat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope everyone enjoys WebRTC for the Curious (I am one of the authors). If you have any ideas on how to make it better I would love to hear :)WebRTC is absolutely magical. Having 'Web' in the name does it a disservice. I see it used to.* Remotely control excavators* Security Cameras* Connect autonomous robots in factories* Low latency streaming from sail boats and rocket ships* And all the use cases you expect (Conferencing, Telehealth etc..)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can webrtc technology be used to pierce through corporate firewalls?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654813</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From datastar's docs:&gt; Backend Setup&gt; Data star uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream zero or more events from the web server to the browser. There’s no special backend plumbing required to use SSE, just some syntax. Fortunately, SSE is straightforward and provides us with some advantages.As a django developer, this is very far from true. With htmx i get almost no backend changes (mainly in template code), where datastar would require me to rewrite to complete logic, and may not be possible to implement at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On thing about datastar vs htmx: Datastar embraces htmx's OOB swap and makes it a first class concept.HTMX's OOB swap appears to be an after thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want a solid demo of what you can do with datastar. You can checkout this naive multiplayer game of life I wrote earlier in the week. Sends down 2500 divs every 200ms to all connected cliends via compressed SSE.https://example.andersmurphy.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655914</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After playing the game for 10+ hours and dropping it out of sheer frustration, I came to the conclusion that I must have been playing a vastly different game than the people praising it.The first hour was great. I was constantly encountering new rooms and solving puzzles. The many times where the game decided to give me nothing but rooms leading to dead ends was annoying, but I still had things to explore in the next run so it didn't matter that much.
After that first hour, the game became a slog. I encountered the same rooms, solved the same two puzzles for resources and was constantly praying for the RNG to give me something new.
There is some RNG manipulation, but not enough to mitigate the boring part of the game.
There are a few interesting overarching puzzles, but most of them are wrapped in multiple layers of RNG.For example, for one puzzle you need a specific item that randomly spawns, use it in a room that randomly spawns which you need to unlock with another room that also randomly spawns.
It took me 6 hours for the game to give me a run where I got all three of those things in a single run.
The reward? Some resources that I have next to no use for and some clues that I can only experiment with if the RNG deems me worthy.I have absolutely no idea where the praise for the game comes from. Maybe this game is perfect for those who are really into roguelites, but for me personally it just feels like the game is wasting my time for no reason at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been playing this game and it is really a blast. The tutorial note cards strongly recommend using a pen+paper while playing and I can second that as pretty much required for some of the more "meta" puzzles.Worth noting that I believe it is also on Gamepass and whatever Sony's version of Gamepass is called if you already had those services and wished to save a few bucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I don’t like what they do to me. I shudder to think how they could supercharge builders like Dorfromantik, Carcassonne, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig.A very similar mechanic is used in the popular board game Betrayal at House on the Hill. That game's arguably even worse because it has stat upgrades!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43628070</guid></item><item><title>24.

My go-to was Pro 8, since it's Carbonized you can run it natively on OS X (PPC or under Rosetta 1). It's possible to take the Pro 6 68k tools and use them in Pro 8 as well: https://github.com/macssh/macssh/wiki/Using-CWPro6's-68k-too...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an aside, I empathize with the author’s struggles to insert files with resource forks with resource forks-oblivious git.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree that merging the technology division from the ministry of economic affairs (BMWK) to the new research ministry is a good step as both ministries have been large providers of funding. The BMBF funds DFG, as well as the large science organizations in Germany (Fhg, Mpg, ...), the BMWK has funded research which is closer to applications, of course looking to enable economic activity.
I'm unsure why the ministry gets a special focus on aerospace, this topic is being worked on by the DLR, funded by BMBF. 
I'm also not yet sure what to think about splitting education and research. It goes against the Humboldtian Ideal, especially in the universitys both topics are connected. On the other hand, it might enable the ministries to be more focused and do reforms that don't depend on each other to be performed more quickly.
The research ministry will go to CSU, the bavarian sister party of CDU. While it may not be very popular amongst many Germans, because CSU is seen as conservative and individual CSU politicians are not famous science policymakers, Bavaria is a successful science hub. Munich is home to international leading institutions (TUM, MPG, FhG). Bavaria is also a hub for aerospace with Aibus and MTU and startups like Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg. Maybe repeating what bavarian policymakers have done regionally to the whole of Germany will be good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the real test will be follow-through. Big promises like "world's first fusion reactor" and wooing global talent sound great, but without a clear budget or streamlined bureaucracy, it risks becoming just another shiny headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The upside is that this will actually provide lots of research funding to small companies. Think of it like the seed round from a VC, but instead of investing into new companies, they try to strategically invest into existing companies to boost future tax revenue.It'll probably be very German, meaning overly bureaucratic. But the basic idea of financing R&amp;D in small companies to grow them more competitive seems legit to me.As an example of what was funded by similar German government grants, you can look at voize, which is (by now) also a YC company: https://en.voize.de/uber-unsEDIT: Here's some German info on the 1.98 mio € research grant from early 2022 (meaning it was awarded shortly before they joined the W22 YC batch): https://www.interaktive-technologien.de/projekte/pysa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658060</guid></item><item><title>26.

I enjoyed contributing to TinyKVM during my time at Varnish Software. It is nice to see that you are able to present and share it with the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These posts from Varnish initially confused me because the only Varnish project I had heard of was a cache/accelerator like nginx.TinyKVM is an impressive marvel and I wonder if it would help to separate the branding from the older name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone from Varnish is around, possibly even the author himself: Last time we discussed TinyKVM here, I wanted to know[0] whether it could possibly be used as an OCI container runtime and what capabilities it would need? Background: I would like to use it as a runtime in order to allow for nesting containers in my CI pipelines, which is difficult with standard OCI runtimes like runc/crun without granting them privileges or at least additional capabilities that AppArmor is not happy about. Anyway, I'd still be very much interested in an answer! :)[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43364218&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43650792</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the necessity of WebSockets in modern web applications, challenging the common belief that they are essential for real-time communication. It argues that many use cases can effectively be handled using simpler technologies such as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with techniques like long polling or server-sent events. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem requirements and suggests that, in many scenarios, these simpler solutions can provide sufficient performance and functionality without the complexity of implementing WebSockets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a minor point in the article, but sending a RequestID to the server so that you get request/response cycles isn't weird nor beyond the pale.It's pretty much always worth it to have an API like `send(message).then(res =&gt; ...)` in a serious app.But I agree. The upgrade request is confusing, and it's annoying how your websocket server is this embedded thing running inside your http server that never integrates cleanly.Like instead of just reusing your middleware that reads headers['authorization'] from the websocket request, you access this weird `connectionParams` object that you pretend are request headers, heh.But the idiosyncrasies aren't that big of a deal (ok, I've just gotten used to them). And the websocket browser API is nicer to work with than, say, EventSource.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually start with the long polling/SSE and migrate to WebSockets when needed. It is cheap and reliable with almost no performance overhead when compared to WebSockets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; If it wasn’t, we couldn’t stream video without loading the entire file firstI don't believe this is correct. To my knowledge, video stream requests chunks by range and is largely client controlled. It isn't a single, long lived http connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43659370</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on setting up NVIDIA GPU support for running Ollama, an AI tool, on NixOS within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It discusses the prerequisites for installation, including enabling GPU support and configuration tips to optimize performance. The author shares step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, and insights on ensuring the setup runs continuously, transforming a gaming PC into a robust machine for AI applications. The process aims to help users leverage their existing hardware for machine learning tasks efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with the other commenters, this post does not explain why you would not just run Ollama or Koboldcpp on Windows. What exactly makes running Ollama within virtualized NixOS in WSL in some way better than running natively?If it's just the novelty aspect of it or some idealogical reason, that's fine, but it should be explained in the blog post before someone thinks this is a sane and logical way to run Ollama on a gaming PC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would dare guess the author just doesn’t know there is a perfectly functional Windows native Ollama release. I was doing the same thing until I realized that it makes no sense because I can just install ollama on Windows and then connect to it from within WSL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have already pointed out if you're going to run Ollama in Windows anyway, why not use the native build? And if you want to use WSL, then I'd suggest using something like LocalAI which gives you a lot more control and support for additional formats (GGML, GGUF, GPTQ, ONNX, etc).https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649711</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery that the Sahara Desert was once a lush environment that supported a unique group of prehistoric humans. This period, which occurred thousands of years ago, allowed for the development of a distinct culture and way of life, highlighting the adaptability of human populations to changing climates. Researchers have uncovered artifacts and evidence that suggest this group had a complex society, challenging previous assumptions about human habitation in extreme environments. The findings provide new insights into human migration and the impact of climate change on ancient populations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are around 10,000 megalith structures in the Sahara, most of which were constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC, when desertification was well underway.  A large number of these were discovered within the last 20 years using Google Earth.  The megaliths come in a wide variety of shapes (there are around 40 categories), but the more sophisticated megaliths have a keyhole shape [1].Like the better known megaliths in Europe they tend to have astronomical alignments and have been used as funerary monuments.  Most of the megaliths point east and have male skeletons, but the few megaliths with female skeletons are oriented towards the west.(Shameless plug, but for anyone interested in learning more about this sort of thing I have a podcast about the history of astronomy and one of the episodes is about the astronomy of Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa [3].)[1]: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Two-keyhole-structures-i...[2]: https://songofurania.com/episode/029&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large part of the human history remains unknown because the Sahara is very difficult to explore and study. 
Who knows, maybe entire city states are hidden here and there within endless quantities of sand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this reconstruction of green Sahara map:https://www.flickr.com/photos/cchurchili/40921572803/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643467</guid></item><item><title>32.

Instead of training an AI to produce a tonne of JS to create something that's been done before, should we not be engineering better tools to allow people to precisely craft software without the need for AI.I worry that because we are now able to instantly produce a bunch of JS to do X thing, we will be incentivized not to change the underlying tools (because one, only AI's are using it, and two AI's won't know how to use the new thing)I worry this will stall progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is impressive honestly.I also find it interesting that the ai code submissions like this one are generally vague about the process.This seem to be created using Cline on VsCode, prompting to Gemini 2.5 Pro using OpenRouter.The commit history implies that a crude version was created by the LLM using an initial prompt and then gradually improved with features, fixes etc. Assuming ongoing conversations with the AI agent.All code in a single index.html file which might not be great for human coders but who cares to be fair.All in all, a prompt history would be really educational if anyone thinks about doing something similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this is too stressful, I created my own star based relaxation game yesterday before boarding a plane.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title should mention the 2023 year, as reference for "recent".As explained in the article, this is actually old news.There has been more than a decade since it is well known that the hexapods a.k.a. insects have evolved from within a certain group of crustaceans, which includes the water fleas.The 2023 research paper linked in the article has only provided stronger evidence for this.The main implication of this discovery is that the myriapods (e.g. millipedes and centipedes) are much more remotely related to insects than it has been believed in the past and they have adapted to a terrestrial life completely independently and much earlier than the insects (the invasion of the land by major animal groups has happened in the order myriapods, then arachnids, then hexapods a.k.a. insects, then tetrapod vertebrates, by a coincidence in decreasing order of the number of legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm so used to seeing the "fish crawling onto the shore" cartoon of evolution that I assumed the branching always went that way - land creatures are branchoffs of sea creatures. But surely this is oversimplified - are there examples in the other direction, where a branching occured in land animals and one branch then returned to the sea?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a fairly science focused article I was a little surprised they referred to "bugs" in the casual / technically incorrect manner, as covered here:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect#Distinguishing_featur...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658093</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;Rust-CUDA provides a framework for developing CUDA applications using Rust, combining the safety and performance of Rust with the parallel computing power of CUDA. The repository offers tools, libraries, and examples to help developers write GPU-accelerated code in Rust, enabling efficient management of memory and resources while maintaining type safety. It aims to create a seamless integration between Rust and CUDA, allowing for more robust and high-performance graphics and computations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary, from someone who uses CUDA on rust in several projects (Computational chemistry and cosmology simulations):  - This lib has been in an unusable and unmaintained state for years. I.e., to get it working, you need to use specific, several-years-old variants of both rustc, and CUDA.
  - It was recently rebooted. I haven't tried the Github branch, but there isn't a release yet. Has anyone verified if this is working on current Rustc and CUDA yet?
  - The Cudarc library (https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc) is actively maintained, and works well. It does not, however, let you share host and device data structures; you will [de]serialize as a byte stream, using functions the lib provides. Works on any (within past few years at least) CUDA version and GPU.

I highlight this as a trend I see in software libs, in Rust more than others: The projects that are promoted the most are often not the most practical or well-managed ones. It's not clear from the description, but maybe rust-CUDA intends to allow shared data structures between host and device? That would be nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using the cudarc crate professionally for a while to write and call cuda from rust. Can highly recommend. You don’t have to use super old rustc versions. Although I haven’t looked exactly what you do need to use recently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool to see this project get rebooted. I'm hoping it will have the critical mass needed to actually take off. Writing CUDA kernels in C++ is a pain.In theory, since the NVVM IR is based on LLVM IR, rust in CUDA should be quite doable. In practice, though, of course it is an extreme amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43654881</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a groundbreaking technique developed by researchers that utilizes sound waves to levitate and stabilize insects for high-resolution photography. This innovative approach aims to enhance scientific imaging by allowing researchers to capture detailed images of small subjects without the interference of physical surfaces or traditional mounting methods. By controlling the movement and position of the insects using acoustic fields, this method could significantly improve the quality of scientific photography in entomology and other fields, offering new insights into insect anatomy and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't have control over the orientation, but that doesn't matter if you can take the pictures fast enough while it is tumbling around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool!

A UI will open when you walk up to each flag asking if you want to fill in the answer.4. you are given a map with the corresponding xy grids delineated, place the mini flags according to the given coordinates to help locate yourself on the map. (remember that your starting coordinate is given to you as well)5. the game ends when you have filled out all of the coordinates' corresponding two-letter names, at which point the correct answer will be revealed for you to compare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to play is explained here [1]By the way you can run the games locally.
Just download all files.For the forest game you would have a local directory:   ├── Build
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.code.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.framework.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.asm.memory.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.data.unityweb
   │   ├── Build_7_30_F.json
   │   └── UnityLoader.js
   └── index.html

then just run the following in the directory    python3 -m http.server

[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a74KM792gbo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't know the objective, so I created my own simple one: get to the lake because I'm thirsty. Then I created another one: get back to where I started so I can bring water to my injured companion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624799</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the European Union's key principles regarding in-game virtual currencies, emphasizing the need for consumer protection, transparency, and fairness in the gaming industry. It highlights the importance of ensuring that players are informed about the risks associated with these currencies, including the potential for loss and lack of regulation. Additionally, the EU stresses the necessity of preventing fraudulent practices and encourages games to implement measures that uphold ethical standards for in-game purchases. Overall, the principles aim to create a safer and more trustworthy environment for gamers engaging with virtual currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow! Unexpected and cool to see this post on Hacker News! Since then we have evolved our VM infra a bit, and I've written two more posts about this.First, we started cloning VMs using userfaultfd, which allows us to bypass the disk and let children read memory directly from parent VMs [1].And we also moved to saving memory snapshots compressed. To keep VM boots fast, we need to decompress on the fly as VMs read from the snapshot, so we chunk up snapshots in 4kb-8kb pieces that are zstd compressed [2].Happy to answer any questions here![1]: https://codesandbox.io/blog/cloning-microvms-using-userfault...[2]: https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-scale-our-microvm-infrast...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The VM vs container debate is fascinating. They are separate yet slowly merging concepts that are becoming more blurred as technology becomes cheaper and faster. If the real bottleneck to scale is adaptable code, then it is foolish to dismiss the VM as outdated tech  when it can be completely rehomed in 2 seconds. That megabyte of python code managing your containers would still be busy checking it's dependencies in that same timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unmentioned:    there are serious security issues with memory cloning code not designed for it.For example, an SSL library might have pre-calculated the random nonce for the next incoming SSL connection.If you clone the VM containing a process using that library, now both child VM's will use the same nonce.     Some crypto is 100% broken open if a nonce is reused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43622514</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the pervasive pessimism reflected in the TV show "Black Mirror," exploring its commentary on technology and society. It examines how the series portrays the darker aspects of modern life, including the consequences of technological advancements on human relationships and morality. The piece also analyzes audience reactions to the show's bleak narratives and considers its cultural impact, questioning whether such depictions of technology are merely cautionary tales or if they reflect deeper societal fears about the direction of humanity's future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, i guess i both agree and disagree with this article.I disagree that black mirror has to save the world. Art doesn't have to literally save the world to be useful, it just has to add to the conversation. The fact we are talking about it proves that it has.On the other hand, i've never really liked black mirror that much. It feels polemical to me. Its unrelenting pessimism robs it of nuance, which makes it feel flat to me. To be clear it doesn't have to be happy, it can still be grim and dark, but when every character is a terrible character, it undermines the storyTake the episode "nosedive" where everyone is obsessed with social media ratings. Compare it to other people who copied it (meow meow beans in community, or majority rule in the orvile). I think the other tv shows did it better and honestly made technology look worse, because they had characters that weren't cartoon villians.Maybe the part i don't like about black mirror is not that it showd technology stripping people of their hummanity but that all its characters already lack humanity so there is nothing to strip, which is kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I disagree with the premise of this article.Sometimes an extremely pessimistic vision of a possible future CAN change things...by making it so people are determined to fight to prevent that possible future from ever happening.The novel 1984 by George Orwell was published in 1948. It is an extremely pessimistic vision of a possible future for mankind....and many of us over the generations who read it really really did not want to live in such a future and acted accordingly.Black Mirror's pessimism could be similar.Also in Black Mirror technology in of itself is never portrayed as inherently bad in any episode. It is the people and the way they choose to use the technology that leads to the horror. In that way every Black Mirror episode has that element of optimism. If only each new piece of tech in reality could ever be introduced so we maximize the positives rather than the negatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not that Black Mirror is bad. It's that, as the article points out, we don't have a fictional vision of the future to use as a goal.The author mentions Jill Lapore's 2017 article in the New Yorker, which is sort of a survey paper of dystopian fiction from that period.[1] No alternatives are presented.For most of human history, the big problem was making enough stuff. There just wasn't any way to make enough stuff for everybody. In the 20th century, high volume manufacturing got going. By the 1950s, the US had this totally worked out. At long last, society really could make enough stuff for everybody.
Science fiction of the 1950s is mostly utopian. With scarcity conquered, the future looked bright.But it didn't work out.Think about why for a while. I'll wait.[1] https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/a-golden-age-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648890</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide on how to make a longbow, detailing the necessary materials, tools, and step-by-step instructions for crafting a traditional wooden bow. It includes information on bow types, dimensions, and design considerations, as well as tips on wood selection and shaping techniques. Additionally, the site features troubleshooting advice, finishing techniques, and safety recommendations to ensure a successful bow-making experience for both beginners and experienced craftsmen.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shooting barebow recurve / horsebow is one of the most zen-like experiences I've had. And it's a workout!I would encourage anyone remotely interested to take lessons before you start practicing on your own to prevent bad habits or to prevent from hurting your fingers/hands/shoulders. Trainers should have light-weight bows, around 16# or so for you to try.
Etsy is a good place to buy accessories (tabs, quivers, gloves, rings, etc.).I've bought arrows/bows from these folks and really like what I received:https://www.szimeiszterbows.hu/https://asianbows.com/And for less expensive carbon arrows, I have a few different sets from https://linkboyarchery.com/. Really good stuff.Lancasterarchery.com is a US-based outfit that has a variety of good equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 years ago, I had a Honduran roommate who barely spoke English. One day he came home with a thrift store VHS on how to make longbows and he watched that thing over and over like it would tell him the meaning of life. I hope he finally got ahold of some yew wood and made one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've made a self-bow (ie a longbow from a single piece of wood) - under instruction it took a couple of days with some simple, but very sharp, tools.If you're going the laminate route do yourself a favour and buy some pre-laminated wood designed for the pressures a bow needs to take. The results of laminate cracking and splintering near your eye don't really bear thinking about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652160</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common issues faced by the PlayStation 3 (PS3), particularly the "Yellow Light of Death" (YLOD) and other hardware failures. It provides an overview of the symptoms of these problems, possible causes, and suggestions for troubleshooting or repairing the console. The author shares personal experiences and insights to help users understand the risks associated with these failures and offers guidance on whether to attempt repairs themselves or seek professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember trying to learn Cell programming in 2006 using IBM’s own SDK (possibly different and less polished compared to whatever Sony shipped to licensed PS3 developers).I had already spent a few years writing fragment shaders, OpenGL, and CPU vector extension code for 2D graphics acceleration, so I thought I’d have a pretty good handle on how to approach this new model of parallel programming. But trying to do anything with the SDK was just a pain. There were separate incompatible gcc toolchains for the different cores, separate vector extensions, a myriad of programming models with no clear guidance on anything… And the non-gcc tools were some hideous pile of Tcl/TK GUI scripts with a hundred buttons on the screen.It really made me appreciate how good I’d had it with Xcode and Visual Studio. I gave up on Cell after a day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It is important to understand why the PS3 failedThat's a weird assertion for a console that sold 87M units, ranks #8 in the all-time top-selling consoles list, and marginally outsold Xbox360 which is compared against in TFA.See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_cons...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With an SPU's 256K local memory and DMA, the ideal way to use the SPU was to split the local memory into 6 sections: code, local variables, DMA in, input, output, DMA out. That way you could have async DMA in parallel in both directions while you transform your inputs to your outputs. That meant your working space was even smaller...Async DMA is important because the latency of a DMA operation is 500 cycles! But, then you remember that the latency of the CPU missing cache is also 500 cycles... And, gameplay code misses cache like it was a childhood pet. So, in theory you just need to relax and get it working any way possible and it will still be a huge win. Some people even implemented pointer wrappers with software-managed caches.500 cycles sounds like a lot. But, remember that the PS2 ran at 300MHz (and had a 50 cycle mem latency) while the PS3 and 360 both ran at 3.2Ghz (and both had a mem latency of 500 cycles).  Both systems pushed the clock rate much higher than PCs at the time. But, to do so, "niceties" like out-of-order execution were sacrificed. A fixed ping-pong hyperthreading should be good enough to cover up half of the stall latency, right?Unfortunately, for most games the SPUs ended up needing to be devoted full time to making up for the weakness of the GPU (pretty much a GeForce 7600 GT). Full screen post processing was an obvious target. But, also the vertex shaders of the GPU needed a lot of CPU work to set them up. Moving that work to the SPUs freed up a lot of time for the gameplay code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656279</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the documentary film "ENo," which explores the life and work of musician Brian Eno through a unique lens that emphasizes the variety and evolution of his artistic contributions. It highlights how the documentary presents Eno's innovative approach to music creation, collaboration, and his impact on the broader cultural landscape. The film aims to provide viewers with a deeper understanding of Eno's creative process, showcasing how he reinvents his work in different contexts, making each experience of his art distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"new and unique cinematic experience"Neither new nor unique. It's been done, many times. The classic is Kinoautomat, 1967.[1]Much video game design revolves around how to keep to the plot while giving the user some freedom. If the user is locked to a path, the game is called a "track ride". If the user can do whatever they want, it's an open-world game. Resolving that dichotomy is hard, but has been done successfully many times. GTA V is a good example.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoautomat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This raises a fundamental question about the role of Art in society. If I want to see all the content in this film I will have to watch it the rest of my life. This is great if I'm making money off of the content but terrible if I'm just curious about Brian Eno and want to see a well assembled, curated interview with him. Producing content with an AI that will re-edit the film on each watch makes post production easy for creators but leaves the task of editing on the viewer, like ringing up your groceries at the market. So why then does content exist? Is it to entertain viewers, to attract eyeballs to ads or as an outlet to creatives? I'd argue it should be a balance of the first and last (ads are a necessary evil today, but creative texts were not invented to provide context for advertising). Work that is fan service often doesn't provide the outlet desired by the creative and work that challenges the creative often bores the audience. This seems like it falls in the second category. No disrespect to Brian Eno.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading about this documentary I became interested in watching, turns out I can't.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a unique laboratory at a nuclear power plant designed to study acoustics and its implications for safety and operational efficiency. By analyzing sound waves within the plant's systems, researchers aim to detect issues such as leaks or component failures that could indicate potential hazards. The use of advanced acoustics can contribute to improved monitoring and maintenance strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of nuclear power facilities. This innovative approach highlights the intersection of technology and energy management in the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ron is a fixture at acoustics conferences, he's a nice guy and was very passionate about making the facility work when he was raising funds in the aughts. If you're going to be in the area and give him enough notice, he'll be happy to give you a tour.Last I heard (which was admittedly about 10 years ago, things may have changed since then), the facility was struggling a bit. It's true that these types of testing facilities need quiet background noise levels for testing, but that can usually be achieved either through putting the facility in the middle of nowhere, or over-engineering the structure. NWAA obviously has both, but that results in increased costs. On the other hand, you have facilities like Orfield Labs and Microsoft's newest anechoic chamber that manage to be _very_ quiet while still located in relatively convenient areas. Plus many audio/speaker/acoustical products companies have their own facilities.That said I'm glad NWAA is still getting press and I hope it remains a fixture for generations to come. We need more of these moonshots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: Underwater scenes for the movie, "The Abyss", were filmed in an incomplete nuclear power plant in South Carolina.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Nuclear_Power_Plant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article doesn’t explain it, but the reason why you want a large space to measure loudspeakers is that your measuring frequency range is determined by the time it takes until the first reflection arrives, which you can exclude by using a windowing function in your measuring software. You only want the direct sound emanating from the DUT, not the reflections (unless you’re interested in room correction).The larger the space, the lower the frequency you can still measure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43621926</guid></item><item><title>45.

I maintain that trying to transition the product away from PHP into a React-ridden mess for the "Block Editor" in 2017 started us down this path of ruin.Clearly they felt threatened by site builder plugins like Elementor Pro, Beaver Builder, Bricks and others that massively improved the WYSIWYG experience to the point where WP was relegated to the role of invisible scaffolding, a dumb pipe.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went down this rabbit hole a while ago[1], it's a fun experience to try out technologies that nowadays are considered unconventional or outdated.[1]: https://deadlime.hu/en/2023/11/24/technologies-left-behind/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  If you find yourself with a scripted language where processing HTTP requests might be too slow or unsafe, I can still see some utility for FastCGI. For most of the rest of us, HTTP won, just write little HTTP webservers.

Without serious development effort, I would expect using an existing web server with FastCGI is faster than writing your own web server. It is also more secure as the FastCGI application can be run as a different user in a chroot, or a namespace based sandbox like a docker container.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's baffling how FastCGI ever was popular, considering how weird it's premise is: let's take this well-known standard simple text based protocol and convert it to our own custom binary protocol, that will make writing services somehow simpler?! You are still dealing with all the complexity of writing a daemon, only difference is that instead of parsing HTTP you parse FastCGI.Maybe today with all the complexity that is with http2/http3 etc it would make slightly more sense. But FastCGI was popular when all the world was just good old plain http1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620676</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in the embedded space. I'd absolutely love to have a tool to build immutable, signed distro images which I can push to devices with a/b style updates. I imagine you can do this with mkosi, but it doesn't quite feel like the intended use case.Most immutable distros (this included) are developed with the idea that you'd run local commands on the machine, and update a single OS image in place. That gets pretty unwieldy to manage across a fleet of devices.Right now the industry standard tooling for building truly immutable images for embedded devices is Yocto. It works well, but it's incredibly complicated and has ridiculous build times because it insists on building every single package from source. It's utter madness that building a Linux image for a common ARM64 processor requires me to compile the Rust compiler myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m somewhat a fan of systemd and I’m interested in immutable images, but I don’t want to build systemd from source:&gt;Sometimes ParticleOS adopts systemd features as soon as they get merged into systemd without waiting for an official release. As a result it's recommended to build systemd from source when building ParticleOS to make sure all required features are supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is ParticleOS also a useful everyday driver for Linux enthusiasts who aren't systemd developers? Let's say I got bored with Gentoo and I want to try something new. Is ParticleOS something that a technical user would enjoy at the current stage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649088</guid></item><item><title>50.

[…]&gt; [The researchers] discovered that the process [of forming microplastics] begins in the soft layers, which grow weaker over time due to environmental degradation and can break off even when the plastic is not under stress. By themselves, these soft pieces break down quickly in the environment. Problems arise when the failure of a soft layer allows hard layers to break off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sooner we stop producing and consuming plastic in all its forms, the better for all life on Earth. There was life before plastic - it used wood, glass, metal, and natural fabric. It was not that long ago, certainly within my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still wonder when we will see the emergence of evolutionary adapted life to this. Bacteria able to diggest plastic.
Mikrobial lifeforms using plastic as a sort of shield from detection ("think of a dissease") using mayflylarva like structures made of microplastics to shield from detection by white blood cells.
I also curious wether misfiring defense detection due to plastic residue is responsible for  allergic reaction disease on the rise in recent years. It would start where the plastic arrives- in the colon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43624135</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article doesn't mention TPUs anywhere. I don't think it's obvious for people outside of google's ecosystem just how extraordinarily good the JAX + TPU ecosystem is. Google several structural advantages over other major players, but the largest one is that they roll their own compute solution which is actually very mature and competitive. TPUs are extremely good at both training and inference[1] especially at scale. Google's ability to tailor their mature hardware to exactly what they need gives them a massive leg up on competition. AI companies fundamentally have to answer the question "what can you do that no one else can?". Google's hardware advantage provides an actual answer to that question which can't be erased the next time someone drops a new model onto huggingface.[1]https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/ironwood-tpu-age-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google is winning on every front except... marketing (Google has a chatbot?), trust (who knew the founding fathers were so diverse?), safety (where's the 2.5 Pro model card?), market share (fully one in ten internet users on the planet are weekly ChatGPT users), and, well, vibes (who's rooting for big G, exactly?).But I will admit, Gemini Pro 2.5 is a legit good model. So, hats off for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is sort of funny to me how the sentiment about whoever seems to be leading in ML changes so frequently (in particular here on HN.) A couple months ago it felt like people were sure that Google completely fucked it up for themselves (especially due to the fact that they invented the transformer but didn't productize it themselves at first.)For a short while, Claude was the best thing since sliced cheese, then Deepseek was the shit, and now seemingly OpenAI really falls out of favor. It kinda feels to me like people cast their judgement too early (perhaps again in this case.) I guess these are the hypecycles...Google is killing it right now, I agree. But the world might appear completely different in three months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661235</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many moons ago, William Gibson did a piece for Wired about his obsession with mechanical watches[1]. The whole thing is worth a read but this bit is worth quoting:"""
Mechanical watches are so brilliantly unnecessary.Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time, and high-end contemporary Swiss watches are priced like small cars. But mechanical watches partake of what my friend John Clute calls the Tamagotchi Gesture. They're pointless in a peculiarly needful way; they're comforting precisely because they require tending.And vintage mechanical watches are among the very finest fossils of the pre-digital age. Each one is a miniature world unto itself, a tiny functioning mechanism, a congeries of minute and mysterious moving parts. Moving parts! And consequently these watches are, in a sense, alive. They have heartbeats. They seem to respond, Tamagotchi-like, to "love," in the form, usually, of the expensive ministrations of specialist technicians. Like ancient steam-tractors or Vincent motorcycles, they can be painstakingly restored from virtually any stage of ruin.
"""https://web.archive.org/web/20240930092315/https://www.wired...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I happen to work in this industry, and just a word for those that compare this with an Apple Watch or a Casio, this Vacheron-Constantin will likely be around 200 years from now, it will still be a testimony of the refinement and engineering of a fine craft that few can achieve, a highly valued item with specialist technicians marvelling on the talent of its builders, just as is the case today with 200 year old timepieces.you'll be very lucky if your Casio can last as long. Your mass commoditised Apple watch will likely be worthless.Personaly, I like the IWC on my wrist as much as I like my Casio G-Shock, both are wonderful in their own way.The Apple watch on my wife's wrist is a fine computer i guess, but at some point, it will have the same "quaint charm" as the IBM Thinkpad she owned 23 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I became interested in complicated watches several years ago and knew I could never afford one, so I made a website with simulated watch dials. Just for fun and education. It was also a great way for me to learn svg animations.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an introvert that’s been consciously working to make new friends, I’ve noticed a couple phenomena:- I’d love to be friends with other introverts to enjoy quiet times together. but… int-to-int pairs will rarely form in nature, however extroverts are great for mediating the connections. Make friends with the talkative outgoing types, because through them you can meet the other quiet people they’ve befriended but you’d never meet in the wild.- however, there seem to be some common pitfalls to introvert-extrovert friendships. From my (introvert) side, you can often find yourself getting insecure or jealous of all the other social connections that your extrovert friends have. There’s an asymmetry there that can feed lots of insecurities. I’m sure that there’s something equivalent from the other direction, but I dont know what it is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a childhood friend that I went to school with for all of my school days. Ever since school days, we find the same obscure things funny and always end up in splits whenever we talk. To this day, I don't have this with any other friend.We had a few years' gap of not really being in touch during undergrad but that changed as we had a few months' overlap at post-grad university. It was easier to meet after that and we did keep in touch, but I felt that he was holding back somewhat and not really being free with his thoughts, letting the conversation flag at times.So at a friend's wedding a couple of years ago, I opened up to him and plainly told him that it's a shame we don't talk as we used to as we both are clearly on the same wavelength when it comes to shared interests and sense of humour. And this worked - our degree of friendship has increased an order of magnitude since before that time. I would have lost a great friend to the vagaries of life had I not taken that step to become vulnerable for an instant then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mutual sacrifice is the glue that takes time to set.Mutual interest propels activity, but reliable sacrifice is the basis of trust and reliance.But if you are perceived as welching on this, you will induce real and lasting anger, justifiably in my mind because  you’ve just made it harder for people to trust for the rest of their lives.And this is not limited to close friends.A girlfriend’s mom’s advice: trust your man only after he’s crawled over a mile of broken glass, and your boss when he’s done it underwater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619032</guid></item><item><title>6.

https://youtu.be/ADXX4fmWHbo?si=6YPZkopyEDc8PSte&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really miss Macromedia Flash. There wasn't a single tech like Flash and SWF format which flourished with so many indie games and animated movies available without any extra downloads (other than Flash Player). Barier to entry was so low.Now, take SVG, it has potential to do everything what SWF could. But there is no editor like Flash and scene/object based coding solution like ActionScript. And each browser has own quirks so only simple SVG is guaranteed to be displayed everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unkey's landing page is a nice example.That landing page is a nauseatingly laggy experience on a very powerful M1 Pro laptop. And slow to load, all for some fancy lines? I'd take a product that focuses on substance over style as dev.

&lt;p&gt;Adobe faced significant backlash after deleting posts related to its Bluesky initiative, leading to a heated debate among the photography community. Many users criticized Adobe's decision to engage with Bluesky, a social media platform, due to concerns over censorship and the potential impact on creative freedom. The backlash highlights the sensitivity around corporate actions in the digital space and the importance of transparency in communication. The article discusses the implications of such controversies for Adobe and its user base.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adobe runs what must be one of the largest deceptive rebills. The vast majority of users signing up for a monthly plan do not realize that it is actually an "annual plan, billed monthly" and thus that if they cancel after one month (for example) they'll be billed for the remaining 11 immediately. I honestly don't know how they haven't faced FTC action for this, as it's been their primary model for 5-10 years now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adobe is the one major company trying to be ethical with its AI training data and no one seems to even care. The AI features in Photoshop are the best around in my experience and come in handy constantly for all sorts of touchup work.Anyway I don't really think they deserve a lot of the hate they get, but I do hope this encourages development of viable alternatives to their products. Photoshop is still pretty much peerless. Illustrator has a ton of competitors catching up. After Effects and Premiere for video editing are getting overtaken by Davinci Resolve -- though for motion graphics it is still hard to beat After Effects. Though I do love that Adobe simply uses JavaScript for its expression and scripting language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, they posted this:&gt; Hey, we're Adobe! We're here to connect with the artists, designers, and storytellers who bring ideas to life. What's fueling your creativity right now?&gt; Drop a reply, tag a creator, or share your latest work—we'd love to see what inspires you!That's such a bland, corporate message. It feels totally inauthentic. Do Adobe (a corporation) really "love to see what inspires you" or do they just want engagement for their new account?I'm not surprised in the slightest that it triggered a pile-on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653885</guid></item><item><title>8.

Banning cars outright also works, of course, but I suspect a lot of the reduction can be attributed to getting particularly bad diesel cars out vs. the limited areas where cars are entirely restricted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honestly, kind of amazing to see a big city actually pull it off. So many places talk about reducing car dependence and improving air quality, but Paris really committed - and the data speaks for itself. Of course, the pushback from drivers was inevitable (it always is), but it's hard to argue with 55% less PM2.5 and cleaner skies over the Eiffel Tower. That's not just good urban policy - that's public health in action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665793</guid></item><item><title>9.

It delves into the mechanisms of insider trading, the legal implications surrounding it, and the ethical considerations of gaining unfair financial advantages.

This was published a few days before the official announcement.So someone, somewhere, knew something before everyone else.[1] https://www.404media.co/benzinga-news-service-that-falsely-r...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These sort of trades happy fairly regularly, before market breaking news in individual stock names.Just search for SEC insider trading cases. When they happen in options they are often pretty obvious unless the market is moving with real momentum the same way, and even then, option sellers will report you if they think it is suspicious. (By obvious, I mean, regulators should start asking questions - of course there can be a multitude of reasons.)The difference here is that absolutely NO ONE on any side of politics seems to think the SEC &amp; DOJ will pursue these.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661680</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this for a while with ErsatzTV and really loved it. I don’t have cable anymore but I remember fond memories of cycling through channels as a child.I set up a food channel that would cycle through Masterchef and a few travel cooking shows, one for anime and one for Bollywood movies.It was incredibly enjoyable. I could just put on a channel after work without having to consciously make a decision on what to watch. Just watch whatever’s on the channel and switch over to something else if it didn’t click!Definitely going to try this out on my NAS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you have the channels, the next step is to pick up a few old RF modulators and run your own cable TV network at home. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7m7OW2xrJE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm backing up my Youtube favorites locally since 2018, so far 10k videos. I might try to use this because seems like would be a fun way to play them in the background on a second monitor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665201</guid></item><item><title>12.

While a universal tariff with no exceptions incentivizes domestic manufacturing, a selective tariff with specific industry exceptions is absolute poison.You might think, as the authors of this exemption did, “well then we will exempt computer parts.” Then people will simply import the parts. But if you manufacture those parts in the US, you are suddenly at a massive disadvantage. Your computer parts factory likely runs using a large amount of imported raw materials, imported machines, and imported tooling, and there are no tariff exemptions for those broad categories… so you’re screwed. Oftentimes there is no reasonable domestic substitute. You will go out of business in favor of someone importing the parts, which now happens tariff-free under an exemption. That’s why, generally speaking, tariff exemptions are deadly to domestic manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43664121</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prot - the author - is a pretty incredible guy.
He maintains a bunch of nice Emacs packages and themes.But maybe even more remarkable: he got kicked out of his flat in Greece, couldn't afford a new place, bought a small plot of land in the mountains and started building a hut from materials he was able to afford or from things neighbours gave him. Really the bare minimum (he often sat in his hut with a jacket in winter cause it wasn't well isolated/heated)Absolutely inspiration, all documented on his YouTube channel https://youtube.com/@protesilaos?si=MnjV7MhKtsT5RDSM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the good things to happen in emacs was the inclusion of `seq.el`. It makes easy functional operation over sequences, so no longer need `dash.el` or `cl-lib.el`. (dash still has many more functions inspired by clojure which is awesome when you need them)But I still wish the emacs community could adopt a modern data structure library. It's difficult to consolidate usage of sequences (lists/vectors) with alists and plists. This would make it so much more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Prot writes something I try to make place to read it. He's a very nice person and also inspiring, he's living following his values and is very insightful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665046</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ArkType is a really interesting library that has a difficult time marketing itself. More than being a schema validator, it brings TS types into the runtime, so you can programmatically work with types as data with (near?) full fidelity.I've been evaluating schema libraries for a better-than-Zod source of truth, and ArkType is where I've been focused. Zod v4 just entered beta[1], and it improves many of my problems with it. For such a mature library to improve like this, v4 is treat and speaks volumes to the quality of engineering. But ArkType has a much larger scope, and feels to me more like a data modeling language than a library. Something I definitely want as a dev!The main downside I see is that its runtime code size footprint is much larger than Zod. For some frontends this may be acceptable, but it's a real cost that isn't wise to pay in many cases. The good news is with precompilation[2] I think ArkType will come into its own and look more like a language with a compiler, and be suitable for lightweight frontends too.[1] https://v4.zod.dev/v4[2] https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/810&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ArkType looks anything but ergonomic to me. Typescript in strings? Double level type encoding?It’s a miracle it can be 100x faster than Zod, but speed was never my issue with zod to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;V4 of zod landed recently and it promises better perf https://v4.zod.dev/v4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43665540</guid></item><item><title>15.

It's like the famous project management tree story: https://pmac-agpc.ca/project-management-tree-swing-storyIf anything, LLMs have surprised at much better they are than humans in understanding instructions for text based activities.  But they are MUCH worse than humans when it comes to creating images/videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, but like.If you do have that skill to communicate clearly and describe the requirements of a novel problem, why is the AI still useful? Actually writing the code should be relatively trivial from there. If it isn't, that points to a problem with your tools/architecture/etc. Programmers IMX are, on average, far too tolerant of boilerplate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I bought those expensive knives. Why doesn't my cooking taste better?""I picked up an extraordinary violin once. It sounded awful!"There's an art here. Managerial genius is recognizing everyone's strengths and weaknesses, and maximizing impact. Coding with AI is no different.Of course I have to understand the code well enough to have written it. Usually much of the time is spent proposing improvements.I'm a few months in, learning to code with AI for my math research. After a career as a professor, I'm not sure I could explain to anyone what I'm starting to get right, but I'm working several times more efficiently than I ever could by hand.Some people will get the hang of this faster than others, and it's bull to think this can be taught.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658794</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed. Windows Server 2000 through Windows 7 were peak Microsoft operating system.By Windows 2000 Server, they finally had the architecture right, and had flushed out most of the 16 bit legacy.The big win with Windows 7 was that they finally figured out how to make it stop crashing. There were two big fixes. First, the Static Driver Verifier. This verified that kernel drivers couldn't crash the rest of the kernel. First large scale application of proof of correctness technology.  Drivers could still fail, but not overwrite other parts of the kernel. This put a huge dent into driver-induced crashes.Second was a dump classifier. Early machine learning. When the system crashed, a dump was sent to Microsoft. The classifier tried to bring similar dumps together, so one developer got a big collection of similar crashes. When you have hundreds of dumps of the same bug, locating the bug gets much easier.Between both of those, the Blue Screen of Death mostly disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A modern reimagining of Windows 2000's UI - professional, simple, uncluttered, focused, no cheapening of the whole experience with adverts in a thinly-veiled attempt to funnel you into Bing - with modern underpinnings and features such as WSL2 would have me running back towards Microsoft with open arms and cheque book in hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are my gripes with the modern Windows experience:- Runs Windows update and reboots without my permission- Keeps trying to make me switch to Bing- Keeps trying to make me use Microsoft Account vs. local account- Does a crappy job of reopening windows on reboot.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the remarkable strength of a Prince Rupert's Drop, a glass object formed by rapidly cooling molten glass, resulting in a teardrop shape. It delves into the unique internal stresses created during the cooling process, which give the drop its incredible resistance to external forces. While the tip can withstand significant pressure, it also highlights the fragility of the drop’s tail; when this part is broken, the entire structure violently shatters due to the release of internal stress. The piece emphasizes the drop's applications in materials science and how it serves as a fascinating example of the principles of stress and material strength.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before discussions go into some generic direction about the field. This is a huge feasibility study contain different aspects done by hundreds of people. People who are mostly interested about the physics case of FCC should read/skim at least through the first volume [1], second chapter (Specificities of the FCC physics case) the first four sections. This is about 35 pages with somehow accessible language to people with some physics knowledge.Personally I'm interested in their proposal about how they are going to approach software (Section 8). They plan to provide experiment agnostic and unified framework that is actually unified and user accessible. The field really need something like that, it is usually the pain point of most junior graduate student. The field suck at documentation and keep coherent software and write code in a bad way most of the time. I think they can have much better framework than Fermilab's art [2].[1] https://cds.cern.ch/record/2928193[2] https://art.fnal.gov/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes me think of The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), I remember a scientist working there in an interview right after the first discovery telling the reporter how back in the day he was dissuaded by his teacher to go into the field because "there's nothing there, it's not a serious field of research" or something along those lines.Maybe a bigger collider is exactly what we need, and if it fails that's also useful as a confirmation to go in other directions. To build it right now instead of other things is the difficult question because that's politics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't feel ambitious enough to me. Spend 10s of billions to get a less than 10x energy about 40 years after LHC reached its peak.  Also planning of the next one should have happened while the last one was being commissioned to avoid the huge gap between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632828</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific security vulnerability in the SAP systems related to setuid binaries, highlighting how a single bug can be escalated into multiple security issues. It details the technical aspects of identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of security in SAP environments and suggesting best practices for mitigating such risks. The piece illustrates the complexities of SAP security and the continuous evolution of threats, urging organizations to remain vigilant and proactive against potential exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking for and finding bugs and security issues with SAP can consume your time 24/7.When left a fortune 500 company 2 years ago, many SAP processes were running in background on UN*X with these arguments:-u USERID -p PWAs a developer I informed the admins a couple of times over the years, the response was "wow, will check it out".  But they ran into a mountain of red tape and gave up.  So nothing was ever done.But as a developer and support person, at least I had a way to fix things without  falling into the bureaucracy quicksand.  FWIW, I only had to do that twice over a 10 year period around Q/E.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a number of reasons why the reporting process for bugs needs a blackout window.Just because a security researcher can discover things about a program that its own developers missed, doesn’t mean they’ve understood the entire picture. If you find one bug, you need to spend time making sure that it doesn’t represent an entire class of bugs. Once the advisory is announced, that’s blood in the water that will attract other predators. Only idiots and tourism companies chum the water before they expect more people to go into it.Back when PHP was objectively awful, I joined the pitchforks and torches mob based on the litany of CERT advisories against it. I had an argument with a coworker about whether PHP was irresponsible to use, and the very next day someone defaced the phpBB instance he maintained because of an unpatched injection attack. I pointedly did not comment because 1) smug and 2) the timing made me nervous of being accused of having been the perpetrator.But I did look at the patch that either just came out or that he missed, and was frustrated to find that the same pattern they fixed existed in two other functions.I really think that it says more about a community, not in what mistakes they make, but how they learn from those mistakes. And I’d like to say it seems like SAP didn’t, but we all know what a beast that thing is. How many tens of millions of lines of code is that thing now? The chances that a person made a mistake and two people they’ve never met copied it are essentially 0.99 repeating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43634408</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We stuck with Yup and ignored Joi, Zod and god knows what else has come down the pipeline since. Rather than wasting time upgrading, we've instead built useful features.That said, we are slowly phasing out our React frontend for one of our apps page by page and replacing it with what we use over the rest of apps: Phoenix + Liveview. The changeset system for validations has proven itself time and time again to both be fast but also to handle many of the curly validation problems we might have. It also has barely changed since its release.If you have a disciplined frontend team then you might be able to make it work. They have to be able to ignore the latest shiny thing that has come along, but if you don't then you'll have a team that is busy constantly upgrading to the latest shiny library rather than getting anything done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only use Zod in a single library, so my experience with it is pretty minimal. One thing I have really enjoyed with it is the low maintenance.So, when I saw this post and read the first few paragraphs, I was filled with dread for having to do yet another major dependency update. Reading of all the improvements- surly the ‘breaking changes’ list must be massive.Having read the full article, it seems like the breaking changes have been kept within reason. One major improvement that stands out to me is the improved Recursive types support, but there is certainly any number of improvements for others to be excited about.The thing I enjoyed most is that excitement of the Arthur really shines throughout the whole article. I’m so thankful this library exists and is being lovingly maintained by someone who is genuinely interested in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zod is installed in nearly every project I use. It’s an essential part of my toolkit. I adore this library. It near perfect as-is and these additions make it even better. Thanks for all the hard work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667925</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave up on the puzzle because it was too hard for my end of the week brain.But, a couple of UX suggestions:a) It shouldn't be possible to drop tiles on the grid outside of the word boundariesb) Dropping one tile on another should swap their positions.With both of these implemented, it'd make it easier to move all of the letters onto the grid and then try different options, without too much fiddling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey what'd you use for your drag-n-drop? It works well, I'd like to use it for something too. Perusing your code, it looks like you wrote it from scratch actually? Really minimalistic, I'm impressed it works this well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love the game and really like that any valid solution works. Would certainly pay a nominal fee for the archives or a way to randomly generate a puzzle w/ seed so my wife and I can play the same puzzle together.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and implementation of a new shader language for Rust, specifically targeting the GPU. It highlights the integration of this language with existing Rust tooling, enabling users to create and experiment with visual effects akin to those found in shader programming environments like Shadertoy. The blog emphasizes the ease of use, performance. and safety that the Rust programming language brings to GPU programming, encouraging developers to explore and contribute to the growing ecosystem of shader development using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've spent a little time in this space, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to write shaders in Rust, although it's probably better than GLSL or WGSL.Let me start with the pros:1. Don't have to learn 2 different languages2. Modules, crates, and the easier ability to share code3. Easier sharing between rust structs and shader code.Now the cons, in comparison to Slang [1]1. No autodiff mode
2. Strictly outputs SPIR-V, while Slang can do CPU, CUDA, Pytorch, Optix, and all the major graphics APIs3. Less support - Slang is supported by the Khronos group, and Slang gets use at Nvidia, EA, and Valve.4. Safety isn't very valuable, most GPU code does not use pointers (it's so rare it's considered a feature by Slang!)5. slangc probably runs a lot faster than rustc (although I would like to see a benchmark.)6. Worse debugging experience, slang has better interop with things like NSight Graphics, and their Shader Debugger. Slang recently got support in NSight graphics for shader profiling, for example.7. Slang has support for reflection, and has a C++ api to directly output a JSON file that contains all the reflected aspects.This makes handling the movement between rust &lt;-&gt; gpu much easier. Also, the example shown on the website uses `bytemuck`, but `bytemuck` won't take into consideration the struct alignment rules[2] when using WebGPU. Instead, you have to use a crate like `encase`[3] to handle that. I'm not sure given the example on the website how it would work with WebGPU.8. If you have pre-existing shaders in GLSL or HLSL, you can use slangc directly on them. No need to rewrite.9. In reality, you may not have to learn 2 languages but you have to learn 2 different compute models (CPU vs GPU). This is actually a much harder issue, and AFAICT it is impossible to overcome with a different language. The problem is the programmer needs to understand how the platforms are different.[1] https://shader-slang.org/
[2] https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/resources/wgsl... WGSL struct alignment widget
[3] https://github.com/teoxoy/encase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone have recommendations for resources for learning to write shaders?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is big news. Shaders have been a pain to develop for in Unity. If I can program them in Rust, leveraging Rust's tooling and ecosystem, that would be huge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667693</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits and enjoyment of learning assembly language programming. It emphasizes how mastering assembly can enhance understanding of computer systems and improve skills in higher-level programming languages. The author shares personal experiences and insights, suggesting that engaging with assembly can be both fun and profitable, especially for those interested in computer architecture and low-level programming. Additionally, the article encourages readers to explore various resources and communities to deepen their knowledge and skills in assembly language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644534"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question of which assembly is best to learn is of course incredibly subjective, but I think the author gives short shrift to ARM32. It is historically important (especially for the Acorn computers, most popular in the UK), sensibly designed, and still relevant today, just in the context of microcontrollers.Some of the most fun I've had programming assembly has been writing HDMI video scanout kernels for a RP2040 chip[1]. It was a delightful puzzle how to make every single cycle count. It is a great sense of satisfaction of using every one of the 8 "low" registers (the other 8 "high" registers generally take one more cycle to move into a low register, but there are exceptions such as add and compare where they can be free; thus you almost always use a high register for the loop termination comparison). Most satisfying, you can cycle-count and predict the performance very accurately, which is not at all true on modern 64 bit processors. These video kernels could not be written in Rust or C with anywhere near the same performance. Also, in general, Rust compiles to pretty verbose code, which matters a lot when you have limited memory.Ironically, the reasons for this project being on hold also point to the downside of assembler: since then, the RP2350 chip has come out, and huge parts of the project would need to be rewritten (though it would be much, much more capable than the first version).[1]: https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/pico-dvi-rs/blob/main/src/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess the comparison here is mainly for fun and food for thought, but I think the answer is that it depends on your use case. If there's a system that you are enthusiastic about and want to be able to develop code for, then that is probably what you should pick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm still learning assembly for fun.Many years ago: x86 for reverse engineering. 
Nowadays: bootable games (https://github.com/nanochess is an excellent treasure trove) and classic game consoles (GBA, SNES) etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43644534</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of the "Sphere" project by Google Cloud, which utilizes a "Wizard of Oz" technique to improve user interaction with generative AI tools. It focuses on creating more human-like and empathetic responses from AI by integrating a structured approach that enhances the capabilities of AI in various applications. The aim is to elevate user experiences by providing intuitive, conversational interfaces that adapt to users’ needs while maintaining a consistent and effective delivery of information through AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Take the moment where the Cowardly Lion first pounces on his soon-to-be companions. The camera pans back and forth between the Scarecrow and Tin Man, with cuts to Dorothy hiding behind a tree in the distance. The experience at Sphere called for keeping all these elements together, in hyper-realistic detail.This sounds awful, as if Google thinks direction and editing are technological limitations rather than artistic choices. This entire project seems fit for a culture that loves content and hates art. If these tasteless jokers ever do this to Stalker I will probably riot. (“Carefully composed shots is for anachronistic dweebs, our society demands an Experience Like No Other.”)&gt; Every change, Hays notes, was made in close collaboration with Warner Bros., to ensure continuity with the spirit of the original.Considering Warner Bros. Discovery’s track record is 3 years of selling out their own directors and writers, I would be more confident if Google were left to their own devices! DeepMind likely has more respect for the film than Warner Bros. management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They showed a bit of this with a high production video of “how we did it” on Tuesday. The outpainting was amazing, details looked crisp, physics sim was pretty good, and the continuity for actors was good. The amount of tech they had to create and manage for the project is remarkable on its own.There were some perspective and lighting issues, and a few small glitchy artifact moments. They probably showed about 5 minutes of footage from various parts of the movie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is kind of strange to me because it implies celluloid film is low quality, but it seems there’s a rough consensus that you can  can scan that size of film in to create good 4K video, if not higher. That’s not enough for the Sphere’s full 16K resolution, but that’s more to do with it having extremely high resolution than the film being “tiny” or grainy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631931</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article on the YakRead algorithm discusses its purpose in optimizing the efficiency of video streaming experiences by prioritizing content loading based on user engagement. It outlines the algorithm's structure, including its use of machine learning to predict user behavior and adjust content delivery dynamically. The article provides a detailed breakdown of the algorithm's components and emphasizes its potential to enhance user satisfaction by reducing buffering times and improving overall content accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun to see this on the front page! I worked on Yakread full time for about 8 months as an attempted startup, after a few years of other recommender system startup ideas. Now it's a side project that I develop on the weekends after my kids fall asleep, aided by caffeine (me, not the kids). I'm in the middle of open-sourcing/rewriting it. Hopefully will be done in a couple months? Then I can finally get back to adding new features. I talked about some potential ones in my previous post: https://obryant.dev/p/rewriting-yakread/also I guess a link to the actual app wouldn't hurt: https://yakread.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hm, I was curious about the biased shuffle, since I was not expecting that particular shape.It looks like we basically build up the list of bookmarks as follows [0]:    x = rand()
    if x &lt; p:
      element = first element
    else:
      element = random element
    return [element] + shuffle(rest of list, according to the original order)

In some sense, it's reminiscent of selection sort. Any particular reason for choosing this approach? One "obvious" downside is that this ends up being an O(n*k) algorithm because you end up building a new list each iteration. It's also harder for me to intuitively understand how shuffled the list is based on the parameter, other than at the two extremes.[0] https://github.com/jacobobryant/yakread/blob/bff756c68d86a07...I'm also curious about the interleaving approach described in the last section:&gt; If you’ve already scrolled past all your unread bookmarked items several times but you have a bunch of new subscription items, we should probably lean towards recommending the subscription items.&gt; I do this by comparing the two lists pairwise and selecting an item via weighted random choice based on how many times they’ve been previously skipped (i.e. scrolled past in the For You feed). e.g. if the first bookmark item has been skipped twice and the first subscription item has been skipped once, then there’ll be a 40% chance we select the subscription item and a 60% chance we select the bookmark item.I thought we wanted to prefer the item that hadn't been skipped as many times (so, prefer the subscription item)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you for sharing. I was hoping you'd eventually publish an article on Yakread's ranking model, I remember you mentioning it tangentially in one of your talks.Love how concise the code is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43626108</guid></item><item><title>30.

But somewhat surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s pretty interesting how Amiga and Atari ST followed Macintosh down a bad path of having large amounts of the OS in ROM, which may have made some sense when a single few-hundred-kilobyte floppy was the only storage most users would have, but made a lot less sense just a few years later when the ROM OS needed lots of patches and everyone had some sort of fixed disk to boot from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome - not only is it a ROM replacement but it can be programmed by the Amiga itselfIt also has a feature where you can exchange files with a pc connected via USB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666341</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO you don’t need to build a full app or company. You could just build a series of niche sites or properties. If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it.Some possible ideas:Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity.Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense.Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc).Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad.You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others have some great suggestions here, but my advice is - don't.I don't mean this negatively, but your focus seems to be wanting to share cool shit you've done.  a successful business sells a solution to a problem, and sometimes to solve the problem you actually sacrifice the cool shit ans just build boring code you've built 100 times before.If you're super keen, pick a problen to solve and build a conpany. Open source all the above code on github and use it as a funnel with links back to your new company site. Then you can share the cool shit, no matter subgenre it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I created a niche CLI tool to clean messy CSVs. It was too small for a startup, so I made a simple landing page. Then, I shared it in forums and added a 'buy me a coffee' link. To my surprise, it brought in small but steady income. You can also bundle tools into a digital product (like a 'developer toolkit') and sell on Gumroad. APIs and microservices on RapidAPI or GitHub Sponsors also work if your tool solves a real pain point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667887</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The catalog is a reminder of a time when the prime motive power for moving material was a human.  Thus, the large number of different shovels(for different materials and situations,) with a human interface (i.e., the handle.)  
Ames was just one of many firms making shovels. Often these were local to a region since transportation costs added excessive costs (unless the target market had no competing shovel makers, say on the frontier.)
The same situation exists for the ax.  Look up "vintage ax brands."  At one time there were many ax makers, mostly regional, because the ax was still a common tool for shaping wood, again, with the motive power being a human.In modern times most of this type of work is done by a machine.  Possibly human run but a machine so trench digger, auger, backhoe, etc..  (or with the ax, a sawsall, circular saw, chainsaw, etc..) With the result being there are a few shovels for sale in, say, Home Depot, most made in China, and, although most construction companies and landscapers have some shovels they're mostly for situations where a machine can't reach or can't do a fine enough job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit of a nerd for hand tools and I've the same book for axes, and another for hand files lying around somewhere. Around this time these tool companies had a huge array of designs for their tools. It seems like almost every region of America had their own pattern of ax head with a range of sizes to choose from, and their own preference for style of handle, of which there are probably more than you'd expect, and users had their own preference for the style of cutting edge too. You had axes for just about any type of wood cutting job you can imagine. The land was conquered by these tools and the people using them put a lot of care and consideration into them, and it showed.Nowadays, you still have some regional patterns available, but they're almost all swamp axes (a general purpose axe, not good at any one thing -- the head is too thick for very effective falling, but too thin for very effective splitting). You could thin them out, but filing the cheeks down messes up the temper of the steel. Handles have about two styles to pick from, and they all come clearcoated, which is awful on your hands, unlike linseed oil. Sure you can go boutique, like Gransfors of Hult Bruk, or Tuatahi, but you're looking at spending hundreds, which may actually be more in line with what you would have been spending for a quality tool 100 years ago, if you adjust for inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN sees AWS as the source for the PDF, but it's more accurate to cite the Alfred B. Tofias Archive at Stonehill College from which the PDF is linked.https://www.stonehill.edu/offices-and-services/archives/indu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43640345</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People have made the point many times before, that “hallucination” is mainly what generative AI does and not the exception, but most of the time it’s a useful hallucination.I describe it as more of a “mashup”, like an interpolation of statistically related output that was in the training data.The thinking was in the minds of the people that created the tons of content used for training, and from the view of information theory there is enough redundancy in the content to recover much of the intent statistically. But some intent is harder to extract just from example content.So when generating statically similar output, the statistical model can miss the hidden rules that were a part of the thinking that went into the content that was used for training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who solely code and are not good software architects will try and fail to delegate coding to LLM.What we are doing in practice when delegating coding to LLMs is climbing up the abstraction level ladder.We can compensate bad software architecture because we understand deeply the code details and make indirect couplings in the code. When we don't understand deeply the code, we need to compensate it with good architecture.That means thinking about code in terms of interfaces, stores, procedures, behaviours, actors, permissions and competences (what the actors should do, how they should behave and the scope of action they should be limited to).Then these details should reflect directly in the prompts. See how hard it is to make this process agentic, because you need user input in the agent inner workings.And after running these prompts and with luck successfully extracting functioning components, you are the one that should be putting these components together to make working system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a real problem, and AI is a new vector for it, but the root cause is the lack of reliable trust and security around packages in general.I really wonder what the solution is.Has there been any work on limiting the permissions of modules? E.g. by default a third-party module can't access disk or network or various system calls or shell functions or use tools like Python's "inspect" to access data outside what is passed to them? Unless you explicitly pass permissions in your import statement or something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43663777</guid></item><item><title>35.

It explains the significance of configuration parameters in optimizing performance and stability. The content outlines different settings, their potential impacts, and guidelines on how to choose appropriate configurations based on specific needs and scenarios, catering to both novice and advanced users.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 20 or so years ago, I have come across a configuration pattern that could be arguably called "Level 0".  It was configuration by file existence.  The file itself would be typically empty.  So no parsing, syntax, or schema involved.  For example, if the file /opt/foo/foo.txt exists, the software does one thing but if it is missing the software does another thing.  So effectively, the existence of the file serves as a boolean configuration flag.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"vibeconfig"1. You give LLM the requirements2. It spits out whatever monstrosity is required to configure the software or service in question3. When issues later arise, you just vibeconfig again with new requirementsEventually new vibeconfig tools will rise because even those three steps are not complex enough. These call LLM APIs to inject the config files dynamically at runtime. "But it's a security issue". So another vertical is born: auditing and securing the vibeconfig LLM autogeneration toolsets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d argue Terraform/HCL is quite popular as a Level 4 configuration language. My biggest issue with it is that once things get sufficiently complex, you wish you were using a Level 5 language.In fact, it’s hard to see where a Level 4 language perfectly fits. After you’ve surpassed the abilities of JSON or YAML (and you don’t opt for slapping on a templating engine like Helm does), it feels like jumping straight to Level 5 is worth the effort for the tooling and larger community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43667494</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research findings on the nature of delusions, suggesting that the themes of delusions may be more diverse than previously understood. It emphasizes the complexity of delusions by detailing various themes observed in individuals, which can include paranoia, grandiosity, and obsession. The study encourages a broader perspective on delusional content, highlighting the need for further exploration into how these themes are formed and expressed in different individuals, ultimately aiming to improve the understanding and treatment of delusional disorders in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "terror of global catastrophe" is what doomscroller media constantly hammers onto its readers. And once someone has "bought in", it's impossible to reason with them. They'll just forever spread anxiety around them.What's interesting is how it happens. Take someone who is mentally stable and subject them to a terminally online lifestyle for a year or two. They will have tons of anxiety about all sorts of things, not the least of which will be that the world is doomed (with no hope), that our societies and way of life are in the "late stage" and moments from collapse, and so on.And it's a bit of a tragedy. If we took only the energy that people spend evangelizing those doom beliefs and put that energy into productive efforts, that alone could probably prevent whatever disaster is being evangelized. But maybe that'd not be good for engagement on social media or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper doesn't seem to actually define their categories anywhere. Am I just missing it? Or am I meant to intuitively know the difference between "spied on / watched" and "spy / surveillance"?Edit - upon re-reading, it seems like they're just using the themes present in the underlying literature, with _extremely_ conservative merging. Which makes the headline claim, that there are 37 distinct themes, pretty pointless. Is "spied on" really a distinct theme from "surveillance"? More likely, there's just no standardised name for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no one told me about this being about schizophrenia, I would interpret Figure 3 as a categorization of american movies and series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43641649</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the theoretical concept of "paraparticles," a type of quantum particle that could exist alongside fermions and bosons, potentially forming a third category in the realm of quantum physics. Paraparticles are characterized by their unique statistics, which would differ from those of traditional particles, and they could have significant implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics, particularly in fields like condensed matter physics. Researchers are exploring the theoretical foundations and possible physical realizations of paraparticles, aiming to discover how they could reshape our knowledge of particle interactions and quantum states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of electrical transformers in the context of modernizing power grids, focusing on the shift towards solid-state transformers (SSTs). It highlights the advantages of SSTs over traditional transformers, including improved efficiency, enhanced control over power flow, and the ability to integrate renewable energy sources more effectively. The piece emphasizes the importance of innovation in transformer technology to meet the demands of smarter and more flexible grids that can support the transition to sustainable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

What exactly happens at the isolation stage. They say it includes a high frequency transformer (HFT). But its input and out put is DC. And classic transformers operate on AC. So in order to get the transformer working, one would have to chop up the incoming dc power into a square wave or a sine wave. But what transistors can you use to do this, considering you are dealing both with very high power and very high frequencies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ex-tesla Drew Baglino is starting a new company Heron for solid state transformersOf topic - dealing with medium voltage e.g. 6kv-10kv - are there existing be-spoke solid-state solutions?e.g. PV/battery 400V converted to 6kv without inverter/transformer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666778</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A question that came up in discussions recently and that I found interesting: How will new APIs, libraries or tooling be introduced in the future?The models all have their specific innate knowledge of the programming ecosystem from the point in time where their last training data was collected. However, unlike humans, they cannot update that knowledge unless a new finetuning is performed - and even then, they can only learn about new libraries that are already in widespread use.So if everyone now shifts to Vibe Coding, will this now mean that software ecosystems effectively become frozen? New libraries cannot gain popularity because AIs won't use them in code and AIs won't start to use them because they aren't popular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As far as hobby projects are concerned, I'd agree: A bit more "thinking like your boss" could be helpful. You can now focus more on the things you want your project be able to do instead of the specific details of its code structure. (In the end, nothing keeps you from still manually writing/editing parts of the code if you want some things specifically done in a certain way. There are also projects where the code structure legitimately is the feature, I.e. if you want to explore some new style of API or architecture design for its own sake)The one part that I believe will still be essenty is understanding the code. It's one one thing to use Claude as a (self-driving) car, where you delegate the actual driving, but still understand the roads being taken. (Both for learning and for validating if the route is in fact correct)It's another thing to treat it like a teleporter, where you tell it a destination and then are magically beamed to a location that sort of looks like that destination, with no way to understand how you got there or if this is really the right place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is doing the math the wrong way. For an extra $5/day, a 3rd world country can now pay an engineer $20/day to do the job of a junior engineer in a 1st world one.The bitter lesson is going to be for junior engineers who see less job offers and don’t see consulting power houses eat their lunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43662686</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the hidden issues that can undermine a seemingly harmonious team, emphasizing that a lack of constructive conflict and open communication can lead to groupthink and stagnation. It argues that while teams may appear united, the absence of diverse viewpoints and healthy debate may hinder innovation and problem-solving.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One counter to this over 20 years in this game is there are plenty of people who confuse "having heated discussions" with being high functioning.That is - I've been on lots of low functioning teams riven with conflict.  Prima donna developers who publicly call managers/teammates stupid in meetings.  Managers giving negative feedback in public instead of in private.  Stubborn veteran team members telling newer team members to get a new job if they don't like how things are done.One pattern I've seen in lower functioning teams with lots of conflict is some members being very well spoken, typically more classically trained like a philosophy background, probably a past debate club type kid.  "Strong opinions, loosely held" type behavior where bad ideas were passionately argued by the more eloquent &amp; aggressive team member until everyone else was exhausted and just let it run.The kind of guys that would steamroll the rest of the team as a bunch of idiots for not agreeing with him, but flip to a charismatic "ah good point" when incontrovertible proof of their idea not being correct was presented.  The problem is you can't provide incontrovertible proof in real time in most cases, and lots of managers confuse their passion/certitude for correctness.So high functioning teams can have heated arguments &amp; difficult people, but heated arguments do not in themselves lead to high functioning teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran a pretty high-functioning team of experienced C++ image processing pipeline programmers, for 25 years. We were part of a much larger, international (and interdisciplinary) team. We worked for one of the most renowned imaging companies in the world.Some of the folks we dealt with, were the top people in their field, and not everyone was especially good at getting along with others.Everyone thought they had The Answer, and everyone was totally passionate about doing their best work.Needless to say, we often had heated discussions.For the most part, we did excellent work (not always, but team infighting was not the reason for issues).My personal experience, is that creative, passionate, high-talent teams can be pretty messy, and managing them, is tricky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this article confuses an absence of "heated arguments" with a lack of constructive, critical discussions. I've found that in mature teams with high trust, people don't have heated arguments precisely because they are not afraid that their voices will be ignored. There is no need to become heated because you trust that the other people on the team will hear you out and consider your viewpoint.&gt;code that nobody questions usually crashes in productionI don't understand what that means.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661763</guid></item><item><title>43.

It is expensive, but it acts like a senior developer. It fixes bugs where Cursor (no matter which model) fails to do so, no matter which model.I tried Roo with OpenRouter, selected DeepSeek R1, as that was supposed to have the largest output token. Asked Roo to create a documentation for a project I worked on. It created a page of markdown with a few mermaid diagrams. Next I asked Claude Code to do the same. With the same prompt. It created several markdown files with half a dozen mermaid diagrams describing the tech stack, the architecture, the data model and so much more. Another level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aider is working for me, but it’s a simple tool. Am I going to experience real benefits from switching to Roo, Cline, or Kilo?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you all do wrong; you should focus on focused LLMs like JetBrains does.

&lt;p&gt;The article from ProPublica discusses a lawsuit against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, highlighting how the insurance company denied coverage for a breast cancer treatment recommended by doctors. The piece emphasizes the struggles faced by patients, particularly the case of a woman whose treatment was deemed "experimental" despite her doctors' support. It also sheds light on the broader issue of insurance companies' practices in approving or denying care, potentially putting patients' health at risk and raising questions about accountability and the impact of profit-driven decisions in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “not a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, in a deposition. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.&gt; At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” acknowledged Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.&gt; On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish more people were asking “why does the hospital charge such absurdly high fees?” instead of “why is Blue Cross trying to not pay those absurdly high fees?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow great timing, I just got a $22,000 bill 2 hours ago for a surgery that UHC approved 2 months ago (in a written letter from them) because they refused to pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43664660</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Microsoft's decision to reintegrate a controversial feature in Windows 11 that can compromise user privacy by enabling the collection and transmission of data, which could lead to potential security risks. This feature, related to recalling recently used applications and documents, raises concerns among privacy advocates and users who are wary of how their data is managed and protected. The article highlights the implications of this move for user privacy and the ongoing debate over data collection practices by major technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the capabilities of using Rust, a systems programming language, to enhance Python's performance through the PyO3 library and other tools. It highlights how Rust's speed and efficiency can be leveraged to optimize Python code, allowing developers to write Python applications that run at near-native speed. The piece also covers practical examples, including benchmarks and real-world applications where Rust has been integrated with Python to improve execution times and overall performance. Ultimately, it emphasizes the potential of combining these two languages to harness Rust's strengths while maintaining Python's ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But what if we could compile Python into raw native code?Am I missing something or has that been possible for at least 20 years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused about the introduction mentioning API keys? The function is compiled on and/or uploaded to your servers?The introduction could benefit from discussing a less toyish problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that the compilation flags utilized are needed in order to properly justify the validity of the microbenchmark here.At opt-level 2 and 3 rust completely optimizes away the interior loop, leaving just two instructions (plus a check for if n=0). given that your graph isnt showing O(1) time complexity shows you either1) didn't compile your rust code in release mode for benchmarking, as the release profile uses opt-level=3
or
2) intentionally downgraded the opt-level of the release profile in order to run these testsI'd be interested to see a more proper example, one where the task itself has some non-zero time complexity. Show a quicksort implementation perhaps. But as it stands this is just marketing smoke and mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632373</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses GrapheneOS, highlighting its commitment to privacy and security in mobile operating systems. It emphasizes the advantages of using GrapheneOS over traditional Android and iOS, such as enhanced security features, increased control over app permissions, and reduced data collection. The text encourages users to consider switching to GrapheneOS for a more private and secure mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love GrapheneOS. The biggest downside is that Google integrity API block wireless payments in Google Pay. All Dutch banks now advertise to install Google pay for wireless payments.
I've tried asking Google to support GrapheneOS but they told me to do a feature request. Which I did and got no reply to. I've contacted the consumer market authority and made a formal complaint since Google and Apple share effectively a contactless payments duopoly and decide which OS distributions get access. Those are closed source and usually bundled with a lot of spyware. I also explained how the Google integrity API might affect banking availability in the future (and already does for some banking apps). They took it very seriously and I hope to hear from them in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was bit confused why this was notable, but the Pixel 9a just released Thursday. So this is an incredibly fast turnaround for a community OS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a after Google deleted the battery life[0], and while the initial move was frustrating with things not working, I've adapted and have a nice feeling of security while using my device again. It feels like it's mine, and I don't have to worry about who will spy on me or rug-pull me next.[0] https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/113917226566692707&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669185</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses a lesser-known alternative to traditional GPS called BPS (Broadcast Positioning System), which utilizes low-frequency signals to determine location. The author highlights its potential advantages, such as improved accuracy in urban environments and reduced reliance on satellite systems, making it a promising technology for various applications in navigation and positioning. The post also emphasizes the growing interest and research in BPS as a viable option for enhancing location services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope it will still be possible to receive a BPS timing signal privately and anonymously with ATSC 3 like one can with GPS. ATSC 3 has the Dedicated Return Channel because marketers “““need””” to spy on every-fucking-thing we do: https://www.atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A323-2024-04...“Conventional linear TV services alone (albeit ultra-high-definition) may not be sufficient to sustain the terrestrial broadcasting business which requires a large amount of highly coveted spectrum resources. Intelligent media delivery and flexible service models that maximize the network Return on Investment (ROI) is of paramount importance to the broadcasting industry in the new era.”That's a lot of fancy words to say ‘we're doing this because it makes us more money’ lol“Recent studies have shown that interactivity between media customers and service providers and between users themselves will be one of the most important features in the next-generation media service. In this document, this unique opportunity is addressed by defining a Dedicated Return Channel (DRC) system for the next-generation broadcasting system.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that this blog post (and the associated video) were a quick off-the-cuff thing while I was on the NAB show floor—I have been talking to a few of those involved in the testing at NIST, Sinclair, and Avateq (among others), and will hopefully have a lot more in a follow-up.Right now it's in the experimental stage, with only 6 towers total deployed (only 5 were operational during NAB, and only one in Nevada... so timing, not navigation yet).The ultimate plan—which is probably dependent on how well ATSC 3.0 rolls out (which has plenty of hurdles[1])—is to encourage broadcasters to add on the necessary timing equipment to their transmitter sites, to build a mesh network for timing.That would allow the system to be 100% independent of GPS (time transfer could be done via dark fiber and/or ground-satellite-ground directly to some 'master' sites).The advantages for BPS are coverage (somewhat) inside buildings, the ability to have line of sight nearly everywhere in populated areas, and resilience to jamming you can't get with GPS (a 100 kW transmitter signal 10 miles away is a lot harder to defeat than a weak GPS signal hundreds of miles away in the sky).The demo on the show floor was also using eLoran to distribute time from a site in Nevada to the transmitter facility on Black Mountain outside Vegas, showing a way to be fully GPS-independent (though the current eLoran timing was sourced from GPS).[1] ATSC 3.0, as it is being rolled out in the US, doesn't even add on 4K (just 1080p HDR), and tacks on 'features' like 'show replay' (where you tap a button and an app can stream a show you're watching on OTA TV through the Internet... amazing! /s), DRM (at stations' discretion, ugh), and 'personalized ad injection' (no doubt requiring you to connect your TV to the Internet so advertisers can get your precise location too...). Because ATSC 3.0 requires new hardware, consumers have to be motivated to buy new TVs or converter boxes—I don't see anything that motivates me to do so. I feel like it may be a lot like the (forever ongoing) HD Radio rollout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-power, and ideally authenticated, alternatives to space-based GNSS are desperately needed, given the sharp uptick in jamming and spoofing incidents in many places.In a true "end of history" moment, the US and other NATO members discontinued both of their ground-based systems (which are inherently harder to jam due to their much higher transmission power, since transmitters are not power limited) – Omega in the late 1990s and Loran-C in the early 2010s – in favor of GPS, while Russia kept their equivalent functional, and China completed an eLoran network last year.Add to that the FAA's reduction of their ground-based VOR/DME station network that lets planes navigate when GPS is unavailable...GPS jamming, and much more concerningly spoofing, will probably quickly come within reach of non-nation-states and smaller groups of all kinds, and ultimately individual actors, and that can't possibly end well for civil aviation if robust countermeasures don't become available very soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669308</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the obsession with 1980s terminals. They're even less powerful than the contemporary 8-bit home computers. It's perfectly OK to be a retro enthusiast, it's another thing to claim that this is the peak tech to power our modern CLIs, or a solid foundation for portable UIs.From the docs:    Stop thinking in standard CSS units like px, em, rem, %
    Start thinking in Character Cells for spacing, sizing, and positioning

A VT102 already has a character grid, but it needs a serial protocol to allow applications on the mainframe to talk to it. You can loop around this and use the raw mode to address individual cells.The web browser has an insanely powerful typographic and layout engine. Now we're looping back into character cells. Something went wrong here, at least once.That said, I like the aesthetic and the default color palette. It's quirky, but it has its places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks awesome and we're fans of the TUI aesthetic at terminal trove (1) (we're biased), it's also great that WebTUI has keyboard shortcuts to go with it.Not CSS but similarly ratzilla (2) also comes to mind, that allows you to build terminal-themed web applications with Rust and WebAssembly.Check out the examples (3) they look great!(1) https://terminaltrove.com/(2) https://github.com/orhun/ratzilla(3) https://github.com/orhun/ratzilla?tab=readme-ov-file#example...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not seeing any icons (on ios, tried a few browsers).

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this with the Viture Pro XR glasses last year and it sucks. Can't use it with Linux, except in dumb monitor mode. No head tracking unless you're using a supported OS. Android app sucks becaus you can't use it with any old app, eg productivity apps (their app is like a demo of head tracking that only supports stuff like YouTube and local media). Maybe I should have purchased the Xreals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been doing this a few months now with an xreal one and minisforum um790.Same ability to power via usb-C and have other ports available.It's worked very well, the 1920x1080 resoultion of the glasses is pretty clear but I find "anchoring" the screen to be most usable because the edges do get a little blurry, but with the screen anchored you can just "look around" a little to bring them into focus.The biggest drawback is the resolution. While still very sharp and clear, it's tough going from a framework laptop 2256x1504 to 1920x1080.I'm just used to everything being a little smaller and being able to fit more info into my FoV vs having to look around a "larger" screen for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AR glasses brings great accessibility improvements, especially those who are bedridden; I wrote the need-gap for wearable low latency computer displays[1] ~6 years ago when I was in bed recovering from a spinal fusion surgery as the only option available to me were those unwieldy bed mounts for monitors and it requires help from others to adjust the angles.[1] https://needgap.com/problems/16-wearable-low-latency-display...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43668192</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex themes and darker undertones present in Tove Jansson's Moomin series, delving into the author's background and the surreal, often melancholic aspects of her storytelling. It highlights how Jansson's personal experiences and the historical context influenced her work, revealing a nuanced perspective on the seemingly whimsical world of the Moomins. The piece also discusses the balance between lightness and darkness in her narratives, demonstrating that her stories resonate with both children and adults by addressing deeper existential themes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure how tongue in cheek this was, but I assume it's serious. Either way, it's a fun and smart read.The article spots well the dark side of the moomins, but in my opinion goes too deep into it. My disagreements boil down to this: "One of the oddest aspects of the Moomin phenomenon is how these complex tales of apocalypse, breakdown and disfunction have been consistently misread as cutesy celebrations of domestic life." Yes, all these things exist, but the point to me has always been that they are cutesy despite that! The stories paint a very typical family dynamic (at least of the time, at least in a Finnish swedish speaking family like Tove's), throws it into weirdest situations, and they all survive together thanks to, and despite, their dysfunctions. And Moominmamma is the most wholesome character ever, period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I lived in Finland for a couple years. Finns, like the Moomins, are whimsical yet profound, like midsummer’s fleeting joy before the long winter. They mirror Finland’s love of nature and quiet isolation, with their cozy valley echoing the Finns forest cabins by a lake. The happy vibe hides struggles—tough winters, heavy drinking—but the Moomins’ warmth reflects the Finns’ wholesome character.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question to Swedes: what were you child impressions of "Pettson och Findus"? I read it to children as an adult, and impressions are that it tells of the funny &amp; sad sides of taking care of children, and I sympathize to Pettson, of course. I wonder how you saw it as children.On topic: interesting read. I'd never think these stories had so much dark side to them.I got all 9 stories in 3 books at the age of 11 and read most of them, and was very happy with the stories, never noticing any of the dread the article speaks about.Especially the Midwinter story was fascinating - we lived not that North, but in cold winter mid-continent, and the story was like looking out watching for the first signs of the spring, that eventually always comes, but you shouldn't celebrate any of those too early -- when day temperature comes above 0 in March, you know it's going to be freezing in the evening. (Later I was stunned with foreigners in our city complain of this March weather, call it "winter" and be depressed!)A few years ago someone on social networks posted her impressions from reading them out loud to children -- that indeed it's depressive.So I guess, the conclusion is that people make opposite meanings and moods of the same events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43672593</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The project "whenever" on GitHub is a Ruby gem designed to help developers manage and maintain cron jobs easily. It allows users to define schedules in a straightforward Ruby syntax, eliminating the need to directly edit crontab files. The functionality includes generating cron definitions from a single file and provides a clear overview of scheduled jobs. The README contains instructions for installation, usage examples, and configuration tips to streamline the process of setting up automated tasks in a Ruby environment.&lt;/p&gt;

It's called "Ten Python datetime pitfalls, and what libraries are (not) doing about it"https://dev.arie.bovenberg.net/blog/python-datetime-pitfalls...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah nice it solves the Liskov violation that the standard library has. In the standard library, dates can be compared with &lt;, and datetimes are dates. But compare a datetime with a date with &lt;, and you get an error. This drove me nuts at work recently.I wonder what benefits this choice has that outweigh the risks of this behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve tried Arrow, Delorean, and Pendulum, plus the stdlib datetime of course, and settled on Whenever. It fits what I actually do with datetimes better, plus it seems more actively maintained. With the others I always seem to have a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I am missing a whole load of edge cases. With Pendulum that seems more baked into the API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43671308</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the origins and significance of the small house symbol found in IBM's code page 437, which is a character set used in early computers. It discusses the historical context of graphical characters in computing, particularly in the early personal computer era, and details how the house symbol became an iconic representation in ASCII art and gaming. The author also reflects on the cultural impact of such symbols and their role in digital communication, emphasizing how they evoke nostalgia for the early days of computing.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, it is linked 8 times in this article.  If this kind of thing interests you, I highly recommend following those links.  VileR's site is probably the best resource we have today that preserves the various PC OEM fonts from a bygone technological era -- an era that lives on in the memories of those of us who first encountered these machines early in life.I'm genuinely in awe of the time and effort VileR has poured into recovering each font, and their countless variants, from a wide range of ROMs.  The site not only archives them all with incredible attention to detail, but also offers live previews, aspect ratio correction, and other thoughtful features that make exploring it a joy.  I've spent countless hours there comparing different OEM fonts, and hunting down the best ones to use in my own work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow this is a beautiful article. I love Code page 437 - my first experiences with computers used it. I made two little things that are a homage to the pixelated and "cyberpunk" "screaming electron" "information superhighway" glory that is IBM Code Page 437:1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges faced by developers in using YAML for configuration management, particularly highlighting the "Norway Problem," which refers to issues related to ambiguous syntax, data type handling, and the complexity that arises with intricate structures. It examines how these problems can lead to errors and misinterpretations in programming, advocating for better awareness and thoughtful practices when utilizing YAML. The author also suggests potential solutions and alternatives to improve YAML's usability in development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even worse is the all-decimal MAC problem.Some genius decided that, to make time input convenient, YAML would parse HH:MM:SS as SS + 60×MM + 60×60×HH. So you could enter 1:23:45 and it would give you the correct number of seconds in 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 45 seconds.They neglected to put a maximum on the number of such sexagesimal places, so if you put, say, six numbers separated by colons like this, it would be parsed as a very large integer.Imagine my surprise when, while working at a networking company, we had some devices which failed to configure their MAC addresses in YAML! After this YAML config file had been working for literal years! (I believe this was via netplan? It's been like a decade, I don't remember.)Turns out, if an unquoted MAC address had even a single non-decimal hex digit, it would do what we expected (parse as a string). This is not only by FAR the more common case, but also we had an A in our vendor prefix, so we never ran into this "feature" during initial development.Then one day we ran out of MAC addresses and got a new vendor prefix. This time it didn't have any letters in it. Hilarity ensued.(This behavior has thankfully been removed in more recent YAML standards.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perl has a Poland Problem. The customary file extension for Perl files is *.pl. This worked well until Apache introduced content negotiation and the convention to add a language code as file extension. It had index.html.en, index.html.de, for example.index.html.pl is where the problem started and the reason why the officially recommended file extension for Perl files used to be (still is?) *.plx.I don't have the Camel book at hand, but Randal Schwartz's Learning Perl 5th edition says:"Perl doesn't require any special kind of filename or extension, and it's better not to use an extension at all. But some systems may require an extension like plx (meaning PerL eXecutable); see your system's release notes for more information."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RelatedThe YAML document from hell (566 points, 2023, 353 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34351503That's a Lot of YAML (429 points, 2023, 478 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37687060No YAML (Same as above) (152 points, 2021, 149 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29019361&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43668290</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide on understanding and managing equity compensation, aimed at employees who receive stock options or restricted stock units as part of their compensation packages.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As our 30 person startup has grown, I made a conscious decision to stop pitching stock options as a primary component of compensation.Which means the job offer still includes stock options, but during the job offer call we don’t talk up the future value of the stock options. We don’t create any expectation that the options will be worth anything.Upside from a founder perspective is we end up giving away less equity than we otherwise might. Downside from a founder perspective is you need up increase cash compensation to close the gap in some cases, where you might otherwise talk up the value of options.Main upside for the employee is they don’t need to worry too much about stock options intricacies because they don’t view them as a primary aspect of their compensation.In my experience, almost everyone prefers cash over startup stock options. And from an employee perspective, it’s almost always the right decision to place very little value ($0) on the stock option component of your offer. The vast majority of cases stock options end up worthless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Netflix approach to this [1], where Netflix allows employees to choose how much of their compensation is cash vs options seems like the best approach - you can tune based on your risk tolerance.&gt; Each employee chooses each year how much of their compensation they want in salary versus stock options. You can choose all cash, all options, or whatever combination suits you. You choose how much risk and upside (down) you want. These 10-year stock options are fully-vested and you keep them even if you leave Netflix.[1]: https://jobs.netflix.com/work-life-philosophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On this April 13 in these United States, I can't help but think of the incredible inconvenience of how RSUs and shares sold seem to be calculated for the sake of income taxes. Please just add it up and send me the bill.  I don't want to pay more than what's due. And I don't want to cheat. For whatever reason, the typical tax interview software guesses wrong or has insufficient inputs when I feed it info from employer + brokerage. So what remains feels like guesswork with liability on both ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675126</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for the Fennel programming language emphasizes its design goals of simplicity, performance, and expressiveness, aimed at facilitating both learning and professional software development. Fennel combines the succinctness of Lisp with the efficient execution of Lua, enabling developers to write clean, maintainable code while leveraging Lua's robust ecosystem. Key features highlighted include a focus on functional programming concepts, clear syntax, and seamless interoperation with Lua libraries, making it an attractive option for developers looking for a versatile and efficient language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not understand the appeal of LISPy languages. I get that the parser is simple and elegant, but I believe the developer (of the compiler in this case) should serve the convenience of the user, not the other way around.Writing code like this is cumbersome and unnecessarily symbol heavy, and reading it isn't really nice as well.I'd rather have the language add that extra complexity into the parser than have me stare down these endless paretheses. Parsing something C-like is not that, hard, trust me, I've done it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love seeing new languages targeting the Lua runtime.  I've been adding Lua scripting support to pretty much everything I make now.  I recently made my SSE server programmable with Lua and it's extended the functionality far beyond what I would have had the patience and time to do myself. Highly recommend Lua with mlua-rs Rust bindings.[0] https://tinysse.com[1] https://github.com/benwilber/tinysse[2] https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fennel is nice.

But this project seems like a disaster in the making.-Making your own fuel.-Using inappropriate materials (e.g. PVC)-Poor storage of motors.-People are standing quite close to the rocket when it launches.-There seem to be buildings quite close to the launch in one of the videos.-Night launches. How are you going to get out of the way, if you can't see the rocket?2 stage rockets are particularly dangerous, because as the second stage can launch horizontally or downward if the first stage tilts (as shown in one of the videos).I think they are being irresponsible with the safety of themselves and anyone nearby. I would strongly recommend they learn a bit of safe practices and make a single stage rocket that works reliably, before even attempting 2 stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to build a two-stage water rocket, Air Command Rockets has detailed build series over on YouTube[1], from simple soda bottle setups to a custom rocket that they got[2] to over 1600m (5000 ft).That's air and water propelling a rocket a mile up![1]: https://www.youtube.com/@AirCommandRockets[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCaiK3Zqs4M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Turns out, PVC was never the move. It’s lightweight, yes, but also has the structural integrity of a soggy biscuit under pressure.I believe that PVC is not considered safe for model rockets, as it turns into shrapnel if it ruptures. Happy to be corrected, if that isn't right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669981</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting! I worked previously for a company that did automatic generation of short video clips from long videos. I fine-tuned a t5 model by taking many Wikipedia articles and removing the new line characters and training it to insert them.The idea was that paragraphs are naturally how we segment distinct thoughts in text, and would translate well to segmenting long video clips. It actually worked pretty well! It was able to predict the paragraph breaks in many texts that it wasn’t trained on at all.The problems at the time were around context length and dialog style formatting.I wanted to try and approach the problem in a less brute force way by maybe using sentence embedding and calculating the probability of a sentence being a “paragraph ending” sentence - which would likely result in a much smaller model.Anyway this is really cool! I’m excited to dive in further to what you’ve done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might want to take a look at https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplitIt uses a similar approach but the focus is on sentence/paragraph segmentation generally and not specifically focused on RAG. It also has some benchmarks. Might be a good source of inspiration for where to take chonky next.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me like chunking (or some higher order version of it like chunking into knowledge graphs) is the highest leverage thing someone can work on right now if trying to improve intelligence of AI systems like code completion, PDF understanding etc. I’m surprised more people aren’t working on this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43652968</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of wasting inferences when using the Aider AI tool, emphasizing the importance of understanding how AI interprets language and context. It explores the potential pitfalls of relying on Aider for making inferences and the need for users to critically evaluate the AI's outputs. The author encourages readers to be mindful of the limitations of AI, suggesting that without proper oversight and context, the inferences made by Aider can be misleading or incorrect. Additionally, the piece offers insights on improving communication with AI tools to enhance their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, a team of junior developers that refuse to learn from their mistakes is the fuel of nightmares. I'm stuck in a loop where every day I need to explain to a new hire why they made the exact same beginner's mistake as the last person on the last day. Eventually, I'd rather spend half an hour of my own time than to explain the problem once more...Why anyone thinks having 3 different PRs for each jira ticket might boost productivity, is beyond me.Related anime: I May Be a Guild Receptionist, But I'll Solo Any Boss to Clock Out on Time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current challenge is not to create a patch, but to verify it.Testing a fix in a big application is a very complex task. First of all, you have to reproduce the issue, to verify steps (or create them, because many issues don't contain clear description). Then you should switch to the fixed version and make sure that the issue doesn't exists. Finally, you should apply little exploratory testing to make sure that the fix doesn't corrupted neighbour logic (deep application knowledge required to perform it).To perform these steps you have to deploy staging with the original/fixed versions or run everything locally and do pre-setup (create users, entities, etc. to achieve the corrupted state).This is very challenging area for the current agents. Now they just can't do these steps - their mental models just not ready for a such level of integration into the app and infra. And creation of 3/5/10/100 unverified pull requests just slow down software development process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Cursor and Code regularly for a few months now and the idea of letting three of them run free on the codebase seems insane. The reason for the chat interface is that the agent goes off the rails on a regular basis. At least 25% of the time I have to hit the stop button and go back to a checkpoint because the automatic lawnmower has started driving through the flowerbed again. And paradoxically, the more capable the model gets, the more likely it seems to get random ideas of how to fix things that aren’t broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43672712</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warning, always convert your colors to from sRGB to Linear RGB before doing any math on them, then convert them back to sRGB afterwards for displaying them.sRGB is the familiar color space you all know and love, it's what your display uses, and it's what has those RGB numbers between 0 and 255.  But it's not a linear color space.First think of values as being between 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 255.  To change sRGB to Linear, do X^2.2 (close to squaring the value).  To change Linear back to sRGB, do X^(1/2.2) (close to a square root).In Linear RGB, a value of 0.5 is halfway between black and white.  You can put a stripe or checkerboard pattern next to the color value, and it will appear to be the same brightness.  But in sRGB, a value of 0.5 is much darker.  Linear RGB of 0.5 is roughly equivalent to sRGB of 0.73.The actual method of conversion involves a complicated curve that isn't continuous, using X^2.2 is still an approximation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm of the belief that fruit and vegetable packaging is often designed to hide defects, and to make it harder to visually discern how fresh the produce is (on top of not letting you touch it).Some examples.Red netting on oranges makes it hard to see imperfections on the skin. Green netting does the same for avocados. Costco sells corn in trays that are cling wrapped with a wrap that is unmistakably designed to hide the ends of the corn (the easiest way to discern if corn has gone bad). Other fruits, and veggies like melons, onions, and potatoes  have similar netting with colors that seem to be carefully chosen to maximize visual clutter.Why aren't all the nets the same color?Costco sometimes sells pears in plastic trays with multiple creases that cause reflections that make it very difficult to see what the pears inside look like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;First, the average pixel is not what I would expect it to be at allIt looks like the averaging was done in default sRGB color space, with:magick "$f" -resize 1x1 txt:-Downscaling should instead be done in a linear colorspace. Human vision is non-linear, but the filtering required for downscaling is equivalent to blurring, which is linear because it's done optically not within the retina or brain. Using ImageMagick:magick "$f" -colorspace RGB -resize 1x1 -colorspace sRGB txt:-Additionally, JPEG supports chroma subsampling, which is usually enabled by default. I don't know what sips does, but with these small files you might as well use PNG and avoid the risk of losing color information this way.This should produce results closer to human perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43673761</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The square artifacts in the dithered image are caused by the distribution not doing second passes over the pixels already with error distributed, this is a byproduct of the "custom" approach the OP uses, they've traded off (greater) individual colour error for general picture cohesion.Me, I adjusted Atkinson a few years ago as I prefer the "blown out" effect: https://github.com/KodeMunkie/imagetozxspec/blob/master/src/...A similar custom approach to prevent second pass diffusion is in the code too; it is slightly different implementation - processes the image in 8x8 pixel "attribute" blocks, where the error does not go out of these bounds. The same artifacts occur there too but are more distinct as a consequence.
https://github.com/KodeMunkie/imagetozxspec/blob/3d41a99aa04...Nb. 8x8 is not arbitrary, the ZX Spectrum computer this is used for only allowed 2 colours in every 8x8 block so this seeing the artifact on a real machine is less important as the whole image potentially had 8x8 artifacts anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One style suggestion: nested `for` expressions can be combined into a single `for*`, helping reduce indentation depth:    (for* ([i height]
           [j width])
      ...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dithered images have the wrong brightness mapping.The reason is that the described approach will estimate the error correction term wrong as the input RGB value is non-linear sRGB.The article doesn't mention anything about this so I assume the author is oblivious to what color spaces are and that an 8bit/channel RGB value will most likely not represent linear color.This is not bashing the article; most people who start doing anything with color in CG w/o reading up on the resp. theory first get this wrong.And coming up with your own dither is always cool.See e.g. [1] for an in-depth explanation why the linearization stuff matters.[1] http://www.thetenthplanet.de/archives/5367&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675309</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Cargo Mutants is a project hosted on GitHub that provides a tool for generating and managing mutant tests for Rust applications using the Cargo package manager. It allows developers to create a series of mutation tests that introduce small changes or "mutants" into their code to check if existing test suites can detect these changes. The purpose of this tool is to help improve the robustness and effectiveness of tests by ensuring they catch potential errors introduced by code modifications. The repository includes documentation on installation, usage, and examples to aid developers in integrating mutation testing into their development process.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously the right thing to do is to decide at runtime whether to insert a bug or not for each mutation point.I had a brief skim through the help for cargo-mutants and it looks like it takes the naive approach which is rather unfortunate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a near perfect use of coding LLMs and a useful way to implement reinforcement learning.“Add a major bug to this file that is not covered by existing tests” vs “Find the bug in this file” vs “write a sensible test in this file that protects against this type of bug”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43647605</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed explanation of cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which are fundamental concepts in information theory and machine learning. It defines cross-entropy as a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and KL divergence as a metric that quantifies how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected distribution. The text further illustrates these concepts with mathematical formulas and examples, highlighting their applications in optimizing machine learning models, particularly in classification tasks. Additionally, it discusses the relationship between both measures, emphasizing their significance in training algorithms and model evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems like a more precise (but still 0 - 1 bounded) metric would be possible to measure "order" or "organization". Entropy fails at this: 0 entropy does not equal "total order". Just "total boringness" (heh :))I considered something related to some archetypal canonical compression scheme (like LZ), but didn't flesh it out. Considering again now, what about the "self similarity" of the dictionary, combined with the diversity of the dictionary?It's more of a "two-axis" metric but surely we can find a way to corral it into 0..1.Very self-similar, and rather diverse? Highly organized.Low self-similarity, and highly diverse? High entropy / highly disorganized.Low self-similarity, and low diversity? Low entropy / high banality. I.e., simplicity heh :)High self-similarity, low diversity - organized, but "less organized" than something with more diversity.I don't think this is quite there yet, but there's intuitive sync with this.Any takers???? :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670171</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ArcoLinux was always one of my favorite linux distros, i have had a lot of fun using it, i have used it few times going and coming back to it, it had a sweet spot for almost every type of linux(arch) user, every DE you can think of, different installers,tons of customizations, the abilty to build your own ISO packed with your favorite apps and tweaks as far as you like, and i was always admiring Erek, the creator and maintainer of the project, an awesome guy who gave a lot to the linux community in my opinion, that's what set it appart from other linux distros, it was a full project, not just another distro with few tweaks, all i can say is thank you very much Erik, for the awesome journey we have had together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is endlessly fascinating how deep the fractal patterns of interests go. I know of Arch of course but have never run across Arco.From the post I can't tell it's actual reach or impact but it certainly seems to have been a significant piece of work in terms of scope.I hope to still noodle on open source in my retirement (when it is time) but I could certainly see wanting to get out from under the many expectations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Arco was my first introduction into Arch-based systems - it taught me invaluable amounts of information. I run Arch Linux now, but Arco always has had a special place in my heart. So sad to see it go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669990</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of MCPs, this post is indeed a quick primer. But from a coding standpoint, and despite the marketing that Agent/MCP development simplifies generative LLM workflows, it’s a long coding mess that is hard to tell if it’s even worth it. It’s still the ReAct paradigm at a low level and if you couldn’t find a case for tools then, nothing has changed other than the Agent/MCP hype making things more confusing and giving more ammunition to AI detractors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need to define and write the functions to calculate interest… what exactly is the llm bringing to the table here? I feel like I’m missing something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This website design is blessed.

About all I remember from those days is:  10 PRINT "HELLO";
  20 GOTO 10;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How could the computer be operating well for the most part, yet also completely wrong?Anyone who has done any overclocking knows about that. When signals or timing are marginal, intermittentness appears. In the PC world, programs like Memtest86+ and Linpack are great at stress-testing to find marginality, but I'm not sure if such software was as common in the 8-bit era.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t personally have the time or inclination to do any retrocomputing, but I love seeing the repairs that people do for them.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the history and significance of the manicule, a small hand-shaped symbol often used in manuscripts and books to draw attention to specific passages. It explores its origins, evolution, and the various forms it has taken over time, highlighting how this seemingly simple graphic has played a role in directing readers' focus and enhancing the art of annotation. The piece also discusses the resurgence of interest in such historical symbols in the context of modern design and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the frustrating things about the manicule is what I think is the reason you don't see it used online, and it is "everywhere" only in physical media: cluttered pages/GUIs and low-DPI screens mean that almost all of those manicules you see as scans just don't work as a digital manicule. It's always easier to use some sort of arrow or background highlight or other way of calling attention to a particular line. Note that OP makes no use of a manicule in this web page, and the only web example OP gives is an emoji - which was intended for SMS chat messages (and looks very ugly, even ignoring the color or other issues with emoji). That is probably why it is honored mostly in the breach by contemporary web designers - many more know about it than use it.Like that gorgeous orange (letterpress, I assume) manicule you see in the middle of OP - that line-work will never work when scaled down and put into a web page as a normal little manicule. The details get lost in a blur, the hand becomes a solid blob of black, it looks goofy and out of place (note: for the mouse pointer, this is a feature, not a bug), or it ceases to look like a hand at all to someone who isn't primed for it by an article.I can tell you that because I tried one that looked a lot like that. I went through literally hundreds of manicules from Wikimedia Commons, Font Awesome, Google Images, and articles like this, trying dozens of them on my actual website, and it took that long to find a single one I was at all happy with in context. I was shocked. No other icon I use on my site was that hard to find an adequate version of. (We really wanted a manicule for our use-case, so we persevered.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Favourite uses: Terry Gilliam's Monty Python animations? Or Dungeon Keeper, where you got to swat your underlings with the floating hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639617</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have aphantasia and probably SDAM. I can barely remember my own life.Ive been waiting for years for glasses that can scan someones face, tell me who they are, and give me interesting points about them (kids' ages, wifes name, what they do etc).It is very common for me to be around town and have people come up to me and say my name, and I dont recall ever having met them before.On the plus side I live in today and dont dwell on the past. It is like a superpower for happiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is common with SSRIs/SNRIs.For me it is not at the same intensity at all times, but it can reach levels where I forget the name of my roommate or the name of my friends partner. However, I still know that I know their names. It feels like there is an error in the communication between parts of my brain. Like it's comming any time now. But it doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found my ability to recall names (or proper nouns) to decline as I entered my 60s more than any other cognitive facility, both names of people as well as objects that have one-off names, such as 'Montessori' schools or 'Schroeder', the musician in the Peanuts comics.  I suspect such name recall is done using a minimum of secondary cues and associations, relying entirely on a very limited subset of neurons and pathways to drive the retrieval.So far, I've not been able to devise any way to improve such recall, other than to guess the likeliest first letter of the name then step through successive letters to, hopefully, trigger remembrance.  But I bery much doubt most of the memory-enhancing techniques that are in vogue will help.  Regenerating a mnemonic to cue the name is no easier than recalling the name itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648536</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of Go channels, asserting that they can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. It highlights potential issues such as the difficulty in understanding channel operations, the risks of deadlocks, and the challenges in debugging channel-based concurrency models. The author suggests that traditional synchronization methods, like mutexes, can be more straightforward and efficient for managing concurrency, promoting clarity and simplicity in code design. Overall, the piece encourages developers to carefully consider alternatives to channels in Go for better software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670373"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Go since 2011. One year less than the author. Channels are bad. No prioritization. No combining with other synchronisation primitives without extra goroutines. In Go, no way to select on a variable number of channels (without more goroutines). The poor type system doesn't let you improve abstractions. Basically anywhere I see a channel in most people's code particular in the public interface, I know it's going to be buggy. And I've seen so many bugs. Lots of abandoned projects are because they started with channels and never dug themselves out.The lure to use channels is too strong for new users.The nil and various strange shapes of channel methods aren't really a problem they're just hard for newbs.Channels in Go should really only be used for signalling, and only if you intend to use a select. They can also act as reducers, fan out in certain cases. Very often in those cases you have a very specific buffer size, and you're still only using them to avoid adding extra goroutines and reverting to pure signalling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I did my 20% on Go at Google, about 10 years ago, we already had a semi-formal rule that channels must not appear in exported function signatures. It turns out that using CSP in any large, complex codebase is asking for trouble, and that this is true even about projects where members of the core Go team did the CSP.If you take enough steps back and really think about it, the only synchronization primitive that exists is a futex (and maybe atomics). Everything else is an abstraction of some kind. If you're really determined, you can build anything out of anything. That doesn't mean it's always a good idea.Looking back, I'd say channels are far superior to condition variables as a synchronized cross-thread communication mechanism - when I use them these days, it's mostly for that. Locks (mutexes) are really performant and easy to understand and generally better for mutual exclusion. (It's in the name!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlike the author, I would actually say that Go is bad. This article illustrates my frustration with Go very well, on a meta level.Go's design consistently at every turn chose the simplest (one might say "dumbest", but I don't mean it entirely derogatory) way to do something. It was the simplest most obvious choice made by a very competent engineer. But it was entirely made in isolation, not by a language design expert.Go designs did not actually go out and research language design. It just went with the gut feel of the designers.But that's just it, those rules are there for a reason. It's like the rules of airplane design: Every single rule was written in blood. You toss those rules out (or don't even research them) at your own, and your user's, peril.Go's design reminds me of Brexit, and the famous "The people of this country have had enough of experts". And like with Brexit, it's easy to give a lame catch phrase, which seems convincing and makes people go "well what's the problem with that, keeping it simple?".Explaining just what the problem is with this "design by catchphrase" is illustrated by the article. It needs ~100 paragraphs (a quick error prone scan was 86 plus sample code) to explain just why these choices leads to a darkened room with rakes sprinkled all over it.And this article is just about Go channels!Go could get a 100 articles like this written about it, covering various aspects of its design. They all have the same root cause: Go's designers had enough of experts, and it takes longer to explain why something leads to bad outcomes, than to just show the catchphrase level "look at the happy path. Look at it!".I dislike Java more than I dislike Go. But at least Java was designed, and doesn't have this particular meta-problem. When Go was made we knew better than to design languages this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670373</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that parts like this are more easily replaced using a hot air station than a soldering iron.Looks like the audio amp fed by the MOSFET is a Realtek ALC1304, which I can't find any data on, but searching for the pin names finds that it could be a clone/compatible to the TI TPA3131D2/TPA3132D2. This part has a power limiter, but if the Realtek one is configured the same way, then as implemented in the laptop, it has no power limit.It is very likely that the reason the transistor failed was because of poor cooling, as it is a low cost, high-resistance transistor that is running near its design limits.The MOSFET that blew up is rated for 2A continuous, and it's in the ~19-20V VIN circuit, so it begs the question of just how loud he was playing his music when it happened!That said, not the first time laptops have come with sub-par audio circuitry:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7205759https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2012/12/10/how-to-fry-spea...https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100530/can-volume-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;None of the images load for me.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, I wrote GeoDeep, what a cool writeup! Glad someone tried to run these on satellite imagery. I did most of my testing on drone derived orthophotos, so was curious to see how it would perform with lower resolution images. Some models like the car model seem like they did poorly. I suspect it's probably because the ground sampling distance (GSD) was in the 35-56 cm/px range, whereas the car model was trained for 10 cm/px. GeoDeep can downscale the input to match the model's input resolution, but can't (currently) upscale it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, love this write up, thank you.Id love to read a little more about why onnx was chosen specifically, and what it brings to the game.There is currently a gap in open and decent models which can be applied to high resolution orthographic imagery, specifically with regards to collection of additional community resilience artefacts such as solar panels and pools. Theres plenty of vendors who want to sell such data, but its so far out of reach of so many worldwide that an open source set of models would go a hell of a long way.Thanks also for including your PC specs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the blog funny for its disclaimer for the workstation specs.&gt; There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down.Good to know!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653078</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a beginner I was surprised (on university machines and clusters) that I can't install packages for myself but if I download the source, I can compile and use almost anything by putting it in my home dir. I still don't quite get why we have to do this dance and can't just install from apt into home, but whatever (downloading the .deb file and unpacking it as an archive is also an option though, but still quite some manual effort.)A great tool to manage these home-based installations is GNU Stow. In fact I've written scripts that just take the tarball, compile it with the typical workflow (autotools or cmake), setting prefix and DESTDIR as needed and then use Stow to put it in place. Then if I want to "uninstall" something, I use `stow --delete`. Works well enough for most of the use cases, like installing a newer GCC or Cmake than available on a cluster etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flying in the face of convention for no apparent reason. Use the normal FHS/XDG directories, makes everything easier.`/usr/local` for system level, non-managed packages`~/.local` for user level, non-managed packages`/opt` for system level "add-on" packages. Typically proprietary upstreams. Zoom, Discord, the proprietary builds of Chrome or VSC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too bad the search for libraries has to be consolidated.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the surprising update to AmigaOS, the operating system originally designed for Commodore computers, which has received a new update after 33 years. It highlights the significance of this release for retro computing enthusiasts and the Amiga community, detailing the enhancements and features included in the update. The piece reflects on AmigaOS's legacy and the ongoing interest in preserving and modernizing this classic software for contemporary users.&lt;/p&gt;

The AmigaOS 3.2 lineage began in 2021.I didn't really get why. Reading Wikipedia articles about AmigaOS and Hyperion wasn't helpful either.Anyone has insights why this project was started and how is it financed? Not that I object it in any way, lovely to see retro software being maintained. Just being curious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The versions and branches and spin-offs almost sound sane until you realise they didn't mention Haage &amp; Partner 'Amiga Forever' lineage, which is what I imagine most users are using today - via the included WinUAE, Amiberry, or various FPGA Minimig (e.g. MiSTer) based devices.This one claims to be AmigaOS 3.9 which is a best of breed cobbled together AmigaOS and roms.I have no idea if/when this might venefit from the fixes to 3.2.3, but I'm imaging never.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amiga is the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43670238</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses dynamic arrays and memory management techniques, particularly focusing on the concept of arenas. It explains how dynamic arrays are utilized for efficient data storage and manipulation, allowing for dynamic resizing as needed. The author presents various implementations and advantages of using arenas for memory allocation, highlighting how they can improve performance by reducing fragmentation and allocation overhead. The overall emphasis is on optimizing memory use in programming, particularly in scenarios requiring frequent resizing and allocation of arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like composable single feature allocators, a free list is just another kind of allocator that may be plugged in at any point.https://github.com/codr7/hacktical-c/tree/main/malloc1https://github.com/codr7/hacktical-c/tree/main/malloc2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You can only deallocate everything in the arena, not individual parts of it.Untrue; this excludes the middle. GNU Obstack is a widely-used arena allocator with a "free everything allocated after this point" operation, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool read! I have been getting my toes wet with the idea of explicit allocators in Zig. I haven't done anything with Odin yet, but it's cool to see that explicit allocators with off-the-shelf standard library implementations is making it's way into more languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43645984</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a critical analysis of the Pascal programming language, authored by Rob Pike. It discusses the limitations of Pascal, particularly its strict typing, lack of certain programming constructs, and constraints that can hinder flexibility and creativity in software development. Pike argues that while Pascal was designed with educational intentions, it fails to cater to the needs of professional programmers and larger-scale software projects. He contrasts Pascal with other programming languages, highlighting aspects that may offer better functionality and expressiveness for developers. Overall, the document serves as a critique of Pascal's relevance and effectiveness in modern programming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the European Space Agency's (ESA) newly proposed commercial launch strategy aimed at enhancing its role in the competitive space launch market. It outlines the agency's intention to create partnerships with private companies and highlights the potential benefits of this strategy for ESA member states. However, the article raises concerns regarding whether these member states will commit the necessary funding to support the initiative, questioning the financial sustainability and long-term viability of the plan amidst existing challenges in the European space industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta; US produces well funded startups presumably because the exits are good. Investors don't mind the risk, expecting an outsized return.Exits are good, perhaps, because US stock valuations are just much better. Investors are happy buying at a higher P/E ratio, expecting it to go up in even further, and make a good return.Now, for a long time, there has been talk of US equities being woefully overvalued. Of course a value is only what investors are happy to pay. But supposing this is true, and US is due a major correction, Trump's "shock therapy" on markets might actually achieve it. If that's true, US valuations would drop relative to the rest of the world (this hasn't really happened yet, most of developed markets moved roughly in unison - but it's early days perhaps).If that happens, US might actually stop looking like a most attractive VC market. This would presumably lead to a general drop of VC investments - but also to a greater geographic spread in VC investments. In particular, more money going into things like European space companies, as opposed to US ones.There's a lot of assumptions here. Maybe US equities have higher valuations because they are genuinely better, or a correction won't actually come. But it always puzzles me why the US seems better at churning out well-founded startups for no totally obvious reason, and maybe that's it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "The top factors ESA will consider in this first phase of the challenge are each proposer's business plan, technical credibility, and financial credibility."The grand European strategy is... to task government bureaucrats to review startups' business plans?? This is going to so predictably lead to more of the same—the creation of companies optimized for writing proposals, and for pleasing bureaucrats.- "ESA also isn't setting requirements on launcher performance, reusability, or..."That they're still ambivalent whether they should pursue reusability or not shows how hopelessly unprepared they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642959</guid></item><item><title>45.

People in your social circle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, can't read the article cos' there's a soccer match right now, and the head of the Spanish league, along with Telefonica, have decided that anyone behind Cloudflare and some other CDNs and hosts are guilty of pirating the TV signal. No reading this afternoon.https://imgur.com/a/DCiE4J0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a decently-sized homelab and I've been renting out unused disk space. I actually allocated 20TB of disk space (RAID 1) and have been renting the space out via the Storj network (https://www.storj.io).If you haven't heard of it, Storj is essentially a distributed S3 that's been around for many years now, and the way it works is that various people run Storj nodes while the Storj company runs a proxy server that breaks files up into small encrypted chunks and stores them across N peers for redundancy.In my case, I back up my family photos/videos/documents to a Synology NAS, and my NAS is backed up to Storj. So when I run a Storj node with part of my disk space, the payments they give me essentially cover my own backups. I'm not making a ton of money or anything, but it's enough to pay for my own backups and that's a great deal.If you're looking to do what the OP is talking about in a simple way, this is by far the best way I've found to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43674267</guid></item><item><title>46.

ALSO: the switch between local/downloaded and all Apple Music is on the Other side of the Screen. It's pseudo-browse ( the back button is inline with the content, and there isn't a Forward button).I haven't been able to find a way to not show the default view that takes up half the screen. It has an image of the album cover and some flat-ux "buttons" and a checkmark icon, plus a (...)  and a 1/4 of the screen just empty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not explicitly called out anywhere, but you can have this and the 'background noise' running at the same time.  This 'chill' music with some dark noise mixed in is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re using the Music app and putting your collection into it consider buying the itunes match subscription. This automatically uploads all your songs and syncs them to all your devices. I download ALACs from albums I buy on Bandcamp and put them into Music, it’s definitely the best feature.https://support.apple.com/en-us/108935&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643120</guid></item><item><title>47.

What you feel as “weightlessness” is actually freefall.Article makes this seem true, regardless of whether or not you are in orbit. But doesn’t  this matter of perspective become ridiculous if you are floating freely in space? As in, yes, you’re “falling” but only because Earth is moving away from you or toward you? Honest question here…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused, the article simultaneously claims the ISS isn't "zero-G" and is "0G". Is it possible to conduct a true 0G experiment on the ISS, or is there always microgravity i.e. '10⁻³G to 10⁻⁶G'?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648423</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like that this review is written by someone who gave Math Academy a serious try. He mentions comments by a couple of other math educators (Michael Pershan and Dan Meyer), but I haven't seen any evidence that either of them has used Math Academy for enough time to evaluate it.(At the time I recommended my son start doing Math Academy, I had done 3722 XP myself, which is about 60 hours' worth.)It's true that there's a stronger emphasis on procedural fluency than on conceptual understanding. But honestly I think that's good: there's so much good material online for conceptual understanding.Imagine you're studying linear algebra: use Math Academy for rigorous introductions to topics and exercises and feedback, and watch 3Blue1Brown videos for conceptual understanding.For younger kids (my son is 8.5yo) I wish Math Academy had some animated or video explanations. For example, the prealgebra course includes the product rule for surds. It was hard for my son to grok based on reading the written explanation. Not because the explanation was bad, but because my son has the attention span of an 8.5yo. So I spent a few minutes walking through that same explanation with him, using a paper and pencil to guide his attention.I also wish they had a mascot and a streak feature. Those features on Duolingo somehow help to motivate my son.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This review reads very much like one written by someone who reluctantly is trying to find excuses to criticize it. Many of the things he says feel made up.For example,&gt; Many of the questions I answered correctly were in areas that I don’t feel I understand well, but where I suppose I had drilled enough in the past for my procedural fluency to survive 20 years of atrophy.The author is complaining that he felt like he should have done worse because emotionally he thought he knew it less than he actually did. This is an entirely fictional, made-up criticism. He obviously knew it better than he "felt" he did.The entire review reads like this, trying to make up real-sounding criticisms that to me just don't make very much sense. The DAG criticism as well doesn't make sense. There is no "one way". The DAG approach probably works for many if not most students, but of course there are other students it won't work for. Exactly like how phonics works for many students but some need to be taught whole word reading. You can't criticize the DAG approach just because some students can't learn that way, but they have to pick one method. I would expect a teacher to have a better critcism than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author mentions Simmons' Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes (1972), which is at Internet Archive:https://archive.org/details/differentialequa0000simm/page/n6...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656481</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related ongoing thread: Federal Government's letter to Harvard demanding changes [pdf] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684386&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The aggregate demands of the administration are confusing and contradictory. They seem to be simultaneously asking for:- an end to diversity initiatives- a new diversity initiative for diverse points of view- a new policy of not admitting international students with certain points of view- ending speech-control policies- auditing the speech of certain departments and programs- ending discipline of students who violate policies related to inclusion- disciplining particular students who violated policies related to inclusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With their endowment above $50 billion, combined with Federal plus Non-Federal sponsored revenue at 16% of operating budget, it makes sense to me they just forgo Federal funds and operate independently.If all 16% is canceled, then they'd need to draw an additional $1 billion per year from endowment at current budget levels.That would put them above 7% draw so potentially unsustainable for perpetuity, historically they've averaged 11% returns though, so if past performance is a predictor of future, they can cover 100% of Federal gap and still grow the endowment annually with no new donations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684536</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinator of the authorization RFC linked in this post[1].The protocol is in very, very early stages and there are a lot of things that still need to be figured out. That being said, I can commend Anthropic on being very open to listening to the community and acting on the feedback. The authorization spec RFC, for example, is a coordinated effort between security experts at Microsoft (my employer), Arcade, Hellō, Auth0/Okta, Stytch, Descope, and quite a few others. The folks at Anthropic set the foundation and welcomed others to help build on it. It will mature and get better.[1]: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MCP is just a transport + wire format with request/response lifecycle and most importantly: tool-level authorization.The essay misses the biggest problem with MCP:  1. it does not enable AI agents to functionally compose tools.

  2. MCP should not exist in the first place.

LLMs already know how to talk to every API that documents itself with OpenAPI specs, but the missing piece is authorization. Why not just let the AI make HTTP requests but apply authorization to endpoints? And indeed, people are wrapping existing APIs with thin MCP tools.Personally, the most annoying part of MCP is the lack of support for streaming tool call results. Tool calls have a single request/response pair, which means long-running tool calls can't emit data as it becomes available – the client has to repeat a tool call multiple times to paginate. IMO, MCP could have used gRPC which is designed for streaming. Need an onComplete trigger.I'm the author of Modex[^1], a Clojure MCP library, which is used by Datomic MCP[^2].[^1]: Modex: Clojure MCP Library – https://github.com/theronic/modex[^2]: Datomic MCP: Datomic MCP Server – https://github.com/theronic/datomic-mcp/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author makes good general points but seems to be overloading MCP's responsibilities imo. My understanding of MCP is that it just provides a ready-made "doorway" for LLMs to enter and interact with externally managed resources. It's a bridge or gateway. So is it really MCP's fault that it:&gt;makes it easier to accidentally expose sensitive data.So does the "forward" button on emails. Maybe be more careful about how your system handles sensitive data. 
How about:&gt;MCP allows for more powerful prompt injections.This just touches on wider topic of only working with trusted service providers that developers should abide by generally.
As for:&gt;MCP has no concept or controls for costs.Rate limit and monitor your own usage. You should anyway. It's not the road's job to make you follow the speed limit.Finally, many of the other issues seem to be more about coming to terms with delegating to AI agents generally. In any case it's the developer's responsibility to manage all these problems within the boundaries they control. No API should have that many responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676771</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article details how the author, Geoffrey Litt, created a simple AI assistant using just one SQLite database and a few scheduled tasks (cron jobs). He outlines the development process, emphasizing the minimalistic approach that leverages existing tools and technologies. The assistant is designed to perform useful tasks, demonstrating that complex AI applications can be built with limited resources by effectively employing data storage and automation techniques. Additionally, Litt shares insights and personal reflections on the project, showcasing how accessible AI can be for individual developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if I love this more for the sheer usefulness, or for the delightful over-the-top "Proper English Butler" diction.But what really has my attention is: Why is this something I'm reading about on this smart engineer's blog rather than an Apple or Google product release? The fact that even this small set of features is beyond the abilities of either of those two companies to ship -- even with caveats like "Must also use our walled garden ecosystem for email, calendars, phones, etc" -- is an embarrassment, only obscured by the two companies' shared lack of ambition to apply "AI" technology to the 'solved problem' areas that amount to various kinds of summarization and question-answering.If ever there was a chance to threaten either half of this lumbering, anticompetitive duopoly, certainly it's related to AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This made me think: what if my little utility assistant program that I have, similar to your Stevens, had access to a mailbox?I've got a little utility program that I can tell to get the weather or run common commands unique to my system.  It's handy, and I can even cron it to run things regularly, if I'd like.If it had its own email box, I can send it information, it could use AI to parse that info, and possibly send email back, or a new message.  Now, I've got something really useful.  It would parse the email, add it to whatever internal store it has, and delete the message, without screwing up my own email box.Thanks for the insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been kicking around idea for a similar open source project, with the caveats that:1. I'd like the backend to be configured for any LLM the user might happen to have access to (be that the API for a paid service or something locally hosted on-prem).2. I'm also wondering how feasible it is to hook it up to a touchscreen running on some hopped-up raspberry pi platform so that it can be interacted with like an Alexa device or any of the similar offerings from other companies. Ideally, that means voice controls as well, which are potentially another technical problem (OpenAI's API will accept an audio file, but for most other services you'd have to do voice to text before sending the prompt off to the API).3. I'd like to make the integrations extensible. Calendar, weather, but maybe also homebridge, spotify, etc. I'm wondering if MCP servers are the right avenue for that.I don't have the bandwidth to commit a lot of time to a project like this right now, but if anyone else is charting in this direction I'd love to participate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681287</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenSourcing DeepSeek Inference Engine project on GitHub aims to provide an open-source framework for deep learning model inference. It includes a well-documented repository with resources for developers to implement and utilize the DeepSeek Inference Engine effectively. The project emphasizes accessibility and collaboration within the AI community, offering tools and examples to facilitate the integration of advanced neural network models into various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In March, vLLM picked up some of the improvements in the DeepSeek paper. Through these, vLLM v0.7.3's DeepSeek performance jumped to about 3x+ of what it was before [1].What's exciting is that there's still so much room for improvement. We benchmark around 5K total tokens/s with the sharegpt dataset and 12K total token/s with random 2000/100, using vLLM and under high concurrency.DeepSeek-V3/R1 Inference System Overview [2] quotes "Each H800 node delivers an average throughput of 73.7k tokens/s input (including cache hits) during prefilling or 14.8k tokens/s output during decoding."Yes, DeepSeek deploys a different inference architecture. But this goes onto show just how much room there is for improvement. Looking forward to more open source![1] https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/03/19/how-we-opt...[2] https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/20...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really empathised with this part:&gt; Codebase Divergence: Our engine is based on an early fork of vLLM from over a year ago. Although structurally similar, we’ve heavily customized it for DeepSeek models, making it difficult to extend for broader use cases.I've been there. Probably a few of us have.Their approach of working on splitting out maintainable sublibraries and sharing info directly even if not integrated seems a really nice way of working with the community -- ie, they have obstacles, but they're not letting the obstacles cause them to take the easy route of not contributing at all. And while it might seem better to someone wanting to use their techniques to share only working code, not info on the techniques, at least it's still knowledge sharing. And again I think it'd be easier for them not to do it. So kudos to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What motivates the commercial AI companies to share their research results and know-how?Why did Google published the Transformer architecture instead of keeping it to themselves?I understand that people may want to do good things for humanity, facilitate progress, etc. But if an action goes against commercial interest, how can the company management take it and not get objections from shareholders?Or there is a commercial logic that motivates sharing of information and intellectual property? What logic is that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682088</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was thinking of building exactly this type of thing here. This is great and I love the simple/minimalistic styled pages.Things I was also contemplating to implement you can freely steal:1. Giving a list of potential interesting investments - these could also be behind paywall.2. Summarize based on sectors to see where there's downturns coming - again maybe paywall this3. Connect with news-sites or twitter etc.. to see what is happening and what is the sentiment. This is a lot harder as you'll need to either scrape or pay to get that info.Best of luck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read lots of quarterly report summaries. I like what you're doing here, but you need to be aware that AI summaries are already built into many existing platforms. So don't expect to be able to monetize this as it stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love it! This is a very useful tool to provide me with introductory (but granular enough) information about new investment ideas that I have.Just two cents based on my usual workflow --1. I like to compare companies within the same industry, so it would be good if i can ask follow up questions after reading a report like "How does company Y compare with company X on XX metrics?"2. I understand that the reports are generated by a model; if that is true, maybe you could cross-reference the fillings with their corresponding earnings call transcripts (should be available for free on many investment websites) and highlight what is being discussed/asked in the calls as wellAgain, thank you for the great work.

I imagine cross species communication would be a major achievement and seems like a worthwhile endeavor to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at Google on the Gemma team, and while not on the core team for this model, participated a bit on this project.I personally was happy to see this project get built. The dolphin researchers have been doing great science for years, from the computational/mathematics side it was quite neat see how that was combined with the Gemma models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not directly related, but one of those stories that is so bizarre you almost can't believe it isn't made up.There was a NASA funded attempt to communicate with Dolphins. This eccentric scientist created a house that was half water (a series of connected pools) and half dry spaces. A woman named Margaret Howe Lovatt lived full-time with the Dolphins attempting to learn a shared language between them.Things went completely off the rails in many, many ways. The lead scientist became obsessed with LSD and built an isolation chamber above the house. This was like the sensory deprivation tanks you get now (often called float tanks). He would take LSD and place himself in the tank and believed he was psychically communicating with the Dolphins.1. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/the-dolp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43680899</guid></item><item><title>8.

The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others," Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro said in a statement.Everyone knew at the time that Facebook bought Instagram because it threatened Facebook's dominance, and hindsight shows that exactly that happened. There's a huge swath of people that dropped off FB and now use Insta, but Meta owns both. It was a great move but it was absolutely anti-competitive at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who’s stuck with Whatsapp and no way out (friends and family won’t switch), I dearly hope for a split.I do struggle to understand how we here casually lump tohether totally different platforms as comptetitors.It’s not like I can use Youtube or Tiktok instead of Whatsapp with my family for direct and group discussion. Even X and Instagram would be a stretch, as their raison d’être is public social media and not instant messaging.Sure the platforms have overlapping features, but you ain’t gonna use a knife insted of a spoon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other articles posted about this:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long until such "rules" also become standardized (like we saw with MCP)? It feels redundant to have rules.cursorrules and rules.aiderrules where the rules content is the same. I predict companies will not only publish coding guidelines for their programmers, they'll publish these tiny coding rules for LLMs used in the company as well, so all code follows the same standards/idioms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found Cursor to be frustrating and exhausting to work with, even with my rules file. When it works, it’s like magic. But most of the time, it feels like working with a Jr. dev who has a bit of a concussion. Code review is wearying work, and using Cursor means you’re doing a lot of code review. I have never once gotten into a flow state with it.That was a long preamble to this question: any senior devs out there (20+ years) who enjoy using Cursor? What’s the trick?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found this a tractable approach, but sometimes not enough. My escalation pattern with cursor looks like this:1. Document everything that you're doing and update a core architecture or technical doc that the LLM can read.2. Update your .cursorrules with specific instructions for .cursor which can grow more specific as you nail down parts of your stack and the patterns you're following. This can be updated (by cursor itself) if you find the same problems recurring.3. I have pre-commit script which runs some internal scripts. If I find the IDE is STILL making the same mistake after I've documented it and added cursor rules, the nuclear option is to add a script here which verifies the integrity of whatever construct is being violated (e.g. tests go into this folder structure, env variables are consistent between these files, import of this model that the LLMs like is forbidden)I would add: any time you expect to be working on a particular feature / enhancement / refactor, have the LLM create a temporary document with a description and an implementation plan and work from that.In addition: I have a specific workflow for resolving testing errors or pre-commit errors which follows the above pattern: Document each failure and work through them one at a time, running the test script and updating the document between runs.I've established these patterns slowly with usage, but it has improved my experience a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658923</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced its intention to adopt Anthropic's proposed standard for integrating AI models with data, which aims to enhance interoperability among various AI systems. This initiative is part of Google's broader effort to improve collaboration within the AI community, ensuring that different models can share data and insights more effectively. The move reflects a growing emphasis on establishing common frameworks for AI development, which could lead to more efficient and innovative applications in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks similar to most other mid-level remote procedure call protocols, from XMLRPC to CORBA.
The usual sync, async, poll, progress test problems apply.
Things I'd expected to see and didn't:- Client to server: "tell me what you can do". This has always been hard, but in the LLM era, it could potentially work, because a textural response would work.- Similarly, being able to ask "How do I..." might be feasible now. It should be possible to talk to a new server and automatically figure out how to use it.- "How much is this going to cost me?" Plus some way to set a cost limit on a query.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given their anti-trust  struggles, if Google for some reason dominates AI, they'd not want people to bring up anti-competitive behavior as a reason for that. Adopting open standards, especially open standards conceived outside Google is good for everyone including Google. They're well placed - from research to hardware to software and data.They'll also want the industry to rapidly move forward and connect data to AI. MCP has momemtum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google owns 14% of Anthropic, author of MCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646227</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to developing efficient algorithms for the optimization problem known as the maximum cut problem, particularly within the field of quantum computing. It presents new methods that leverage quantum techniques to improve solution quality and computational speed, aiming to outperform classical algorithms. The study emphasizes the potential implications of quantum algorithms in various applications, including network design and statistical physics, while also addressing the theoretical foundations behind their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a neat idea. It's not too dissimilar in spirit from gradient boosting. The point about credit assignment is crucial, and that's the same reason most architectures and initialization methods are so convoluted nowadays.I don't really like one of their premises and conclusions:&gt; that does not learn hierarchical representationsThere's an implicit bias here that (a) traditional networks do learn hierarchial representations, (b) that's bad, and (c) this training method does not learn those. However, [a] is situational, and it's easy to construct datasets where a standard gradient-descent neural net will learn a different way, even with a reverse hierarchy. [b] is unproven and also doesn't make a lot of intuitive sense to me. [c], even in this paper where they make that claim, has no evidence and also doesn't seem likely to be true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jsft3c/r_...I'm still not quite sure how to think of this. Maybe as being like unrolling a diffusion model, the equivalent of BPTT for RNNs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting idea for sure, but why only evaluate it on 28x28 pixel images? Why is their flow matching so much worse in some cases? Missing some analysis. Their words on it say nothing:&gt; For CIFAR-100 with one-hot embeddings, NoProp-FM fails to learn effectively, resulting in very slow accuracy improvementIn general any actual analysis is made impossible because of the lack of signal in the results. Fig 5 tells me nothing when the span is 99.58 to 99.46 percent accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676837</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering why it is so satisfying. It tells that what you pursue doesn't matter. It can be a wood-planing contest or some silly hobby. What matters is that you are motivated to pursue it. You believe in improving that pursuit, you see others doing the same, you believe it is the social norm, you see that it is valued and respected. And most importantly you feel good about it.Talk about things like investing in stocks, being known as a great techie or entrepreneur, exiting a great startup, running a venture capital, making a few million, becoming US citizen, having a great home etc. These goals are not bad. Just that they cost more, for the same returns (satisfaction). You are more successful when your happiness doesn't cost you a life-time running around or some herculean effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential but the name is a pun - "kezuroukai" translates to "shall we shave?" in Japanese, but "kai" can also mean something like "gathering" or "community".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow 10 micron is a lot smaller than I thought a handmade wood shaving would be.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the experiences and insights of a former Google employee who transitioned to a different career path. It highlights their personal journey, lessons learned while working at Google, and the challenges faced when adapting to life outside the tech giant. The piece delves into the impact of corporate culture on individual growth and the importance of pursuing personal interests and passions post-Google.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layoffs are a difficult thing for employees and their managers.  I have seen people (one was a VP of Engineering) escorted out of the building, sent in a cab to home along with a security guard (this was in India), not allowed access to computer or talk with other employees. 
 But, recently have had a very different experience. The current company I work for announced 30% layoffs. The list was made public within one hour of announcement. The CEO detailed the process of selecting people. The severance was very generous (3-6 months pay) along with health and other benefits. The impacted employees were allowed to keep the laptop and any other assets they took from the company.  They even paid the same severance to contractors.After the announcement, the laid off employees were given a few days in the company to allow them to say good byes. I love the CEOs comment on this ' I trusted them yesterday, I trust them today'. This was by far the kindest way of laying off employees imo. People were treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've skimmed through the comments; and seen that most people have commented on the cog in the machine thing, or on layoffs in general and how they suck.To me, the shock from this blog post was about seeing a Chrome developer relations engineer whom I have grown to admire and who has been doing a stellar job educating web developers on new html and css features, get the sack. He was one of the best remaining speakers on web topics at the Chrome team (I am still sad about the departure of Paul Lewis and Jake Archibald); and produced a lot of top-notch educational materials (the CSS podcast; the conference talks; the demos).What does this say about Google's attitude to web and to Chrome? What does this say about Google's commitment to developer excellence?I understand that this is a personal tragedy for Adam; but for me personally, this is also a huge disillusionment in Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But I was also immediately ripped away from my calendar, docs, code, and more.Layoffs are never easy. I've been through a few myself and it really takes the wind out of your sails. That being said, this sentence made me pause a bit. None of these things mentioned are actually yours. They are the property of Google.One thing that helped me immensely in my career is understanding that my relationship with a company is a business relationship. They pay me for my time and skills and nothing more. Today I can have a job and tomorrow maybe not. I recommended learning how to separate your value from your employer. It's not easy but it's necessary. I'm not saying you can't enjoy what you do or be excited by it but don't fully tether yourself and your well-being to a company.Godspeed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658089</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an in-depth exploration of the internal workings of SQLite, a lightweight and serverless database engine. It covers various components and features of SQLite, including its architecture, the SQL language implementation, data storage mechanisms, and optimization strategies. The content is aimed at developers and database enthusiasts seeking to understand how SQLite operates under the hood, with detailed explanations, diagrams, and code examples to illustrate key concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really would've come in handy when I was debugging my own SQLite parser a couple weeks ago.One thing that initially confused me was how exactly the pages worked w.r.t. the first page on disk... I misunderstood the SQLite documentation in different ways, but it's really rather simple: the very first page is just treated as containing the file header in it, and it pushes down the rest of the data, making the page shorter than the other pages. You can see that illustrated clearly if you click into the first page of a database using this tool: the database header comes first, then the page header.This tool will undoubtedly come in handy for anyone who has a reason to be dealing with SQLite data structures directly for whatever reason, especially since the SQLite documentation is a bit terse at times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I especially like that it provides a sample database. Would be nice it were downloadable as a file, so we could explore it with our own tools as well and get a better feeling for how the tool works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is super cool and will really help anyone studying how to build their own storage engines.A note: the table that describes the data structures (Field # | Description | Value) should also list the data type (uint8 uint16 int32 text etc.). If it's an enum ("Table Leaf"), reference other possible enum values. If its length depends on another field, reference that field No.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682006</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recently discovered vulnerability in GitHub Copilot and Cursor, highlighting how these code generation tools can be exploited by malicious actors. It explains that attackers can manipulate the input to these AI-driven code agents, potentially leading to the generation of harmful code snippets. The piece emphasizes the implications of such vulnerabilities for software security and calls for heightened awareness and protective measures within the developer community to mitigate risks associated with automated coding assistance tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:&gt; A 2024 GitHub survey found that nearly all enterprise developers (97%) are using Generative AI coding tools. These tools have rapidly evolved from experimental novelties to mission-critical development infrastructure, with teams across the globe relying on them daily to accelerate coding tasks.That seemed high, what the actual report says:&gt; More than 97% of respondents reported having used AI coding tools at work at some point, a finding consistent across all four countries. However, a smaller percentage said their companies actively encourage AI tool adoption or allow the use of AI tools, varying by region. The U.S. leads with 88% of respondents indicating at least some company support for AI use, while Germany is lowest at 59%. This highlights an opportunity for organizations to better support their developers’ interest in AI tools, considering local regulations.Fun that the survey uses the stats to say that companies should support increasing usage, while the article uses it to try and show near-total usage already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; effectively turning the developer's most trusted assistant into an unwitting accomplice"Most trusted assistant" - that made me chuckle. The assistant that hallucinates packages, avoides null-pointer checks and forgets details that I've asked it.. yes, my most trusted assistant :D :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most concerning part of the attack here seems to be the ability to hide arbitrary text in a simple text file using Unicode tricks such that GitHub doesn't actually show this text at all, per the authors. Couple this with the ability of LLMs to "execute" any instruction in the input set, regardless of such a weird encoding, and you've got a recipe for attacks.However, I wouldn't put any fault here on the AIs themselves. It's the fact that you can hide data in a plain text file that is the root of the issue - the whole attack goes away once you fix that part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677067</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that the universe tends toward increasing complexity over time, examining various scientific perspectives and theories that explain this phenomenon. It highlights how complexity arises in different systems, from biological evolution to physical processes, and explores concepts such as entropy and self-organization. The piece also delves into the implications of this tendency for our understanding of the universe and its fundamental principles, suggesting that complexity is not just a byproduct of randomness but an integral aspect of cosmic development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tried reading the paper [1]. I understand the authors are academics, which is why I'm surprised the paper reads like a layman's attempt at a contributing to a "theory of everything", or at best, an inquiry written by a 18th century European philosopher of science.- "identification of conceptual equivalencies among disparate phenomena were foundational to developing previous laws of nature" - what exactly is a "conceptual equivalence"? You mean models? Unifying disparate observations into models is basic science. Not sure why it is highlighted here as some important insight.- "The laws of classical physics emerged as efforts to provide comprehensive, predictive explanations of phenomena in the macroscopic world" - followed by a laymen's listing of physical laws, then goes on to claim "conspicuously absent is a law of increasing “complexity.”"- then a jumble of examples including gravitation, stellar evolution, mineral evolution and biological evolution- this just feels like a slight generalization of evolution: "Systems of many interacting agents display an increase in diversity, distribution, and/or patterned behavior when numerous configurations of the system are subject to selective pressure."At this point, I gave up.[1] https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310223120&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coincidentally, I'm reading Walker's book "Life as No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence" on the same topic. (Walker is one of the researchers in the article.) Summary: I don't like the book. The book was motivating me to write an article "Books I don't like", but I'll comment here instead :-)The book describes "Assembly Theory", a theory of how life can arise in the universe. The idea is that you can quantitatively measure the complexity of objects (especially chemicals) by the number of recursive steps to create them. (The molecule ATP is 21 for instance.) You need life to create anything over 15; the idea of life is it contains information that can create structures more complex than what can be created randomly. The important thing about life is that it isn't spontaneous, but forms an unbroken chain through time. Explaining how it started may require new physics.If the above seems unclear, it's because it is unclear to me. The book doesn't do a good job of explaining things. It looks like a mass-market science book, but I found it very confusing. For instance, it's unclear where the number 21 for ATP comes from, although there's an analogy to LEGO. The book doesn't define things and goes into many, many tangents. The author is very, very enthusiastic about the ideas but reading the book is like looking at ideas through a cloud of vagueness.The writing is also extremely quirky. Everyone is on a first-name basis, from Albert (Einstein) to Johnny (von Neumann) and Erwin (Schrödinger). One chapter is written in the second person, and "you" turn out to be "Albert." The book pushes the idea that physics is great and can solve everything, covering physics "greatest hits" from relativity and quantum mechanics to gravitational waves and the Higgs boson. (The underlying theme is: "Physics is great. This book is physics. Therefore, this book is great.") The book has a lot of discussion of how it is a new paradigm, Kuhn's paradigm shifts, how it will move astrobiology beyond the pre-paradigmatic phase and unify fields of research and so forth. It's not a crackpot book, but there are an uncomfortable number of crackpot red flags.I'm not rejecting the idea of assembly theory. To be honest, after reading the book, I don't understand it well enough to say which parts seem good and which parts seem flawed. There seem to be interesting ideas struggling to get out but I'm not getting them. (I don't like to be negative about books, but there are a few that I regret reading and feel that I should warn people.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Complexity" is a hugely problematic term when used in this way - remember that entropy and complexity are related, but they are not interchangeable. A complex system can have lower entropy than a simpler system, and conversely, a system can have high entropy but be relatively simple.  By mingling these terms without specifying objective reference points, it all just comes out as word salad.This paper just reads like an attempt at sounding smart while actually saying little.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677232</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The project provides TypeScript definitions for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) generated code, allowing for seamless integration of protobuf with TypeScript in applications. It aims to enhance the TypeScript developer experience by offering type safety and improving readability when working with protocol buffers. The repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and details on how to contribute, making it a comprehensive resource for developers looking to leverage protobuf with TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that the source is so small is wild. I would have expected a huge convoluted parsing library implemented in types.On the other hand, the fact that this is even possible is more wild. Instead of replacing JS with a proper statically-typed language, we're spending all this effort turning a preprocessor's type system into a turing-complete metalanguage. Pretty soon we'll be able to compile TypeScript entirely using types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s pretty rad how flexible template literal types are, but I can’t imagine wanting this kind of shenanigans hanging out in a production app slowing down compile times. I prefer to define types in TypeScript and generate proto from that, since the TypeScript type system is so much more powerful than the Protobuf system. Types are much more composable in TS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be even nicer if TypeScript added type inference for tagged template literals, like in this issue [1]. Then you could write:    const schema = proto`
      syntax = "proto3";

      message Person { ... }
    `;

    type Person = typeof schema['Person'];

And you could get built-in schema validation with a sophisticated enough type definition for `proto`, nice syntax highlighting in many tools with a nested grammar.We would love to see this feature in TypeScript to be able to have type-safe template in lit-html without an external tool.The issue hasn't seen much activity lately, but it would be good to highlight this library as another use case.[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33304&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682547</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to see that the code[1] is AGPL-3.0 licensed.[1]: https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there anything like this but for analyzing thousands of models? Most of this type of tool seem to work best for iterating and experimenting, but I'd actually like to use it for tracking and debugging something in production.We have a service that runs thousands of custom, user-defined models and when something goes awry having this level of insight would be pretty useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems quite comprehensive. I wonder if there’s a way to “escape” from the system. It looks nice for getting started but in practice at some point you’ll want programmatic access for e.g. advanced API features.E.g. a well behaving system independent pipeline serialization could work. Didn’t find anything about this with a quick glance of the docs.Edit: with a bit longer glance there is a plugin system that allows adding custom code quite easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43660952</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm looking at using OCI at $DAY_JOB for model distribution for fleets of machines also so it's good to see it's getting some traction elsewhere.OCI has some benefits over other systems, namely that tiered caching/pull-through is already pretty battle-tested as is signing etc, beating more naive distribution methods for reliability, performance and trust.If combined with eStargz or zstd::chunked it's also pretty nice for distributed systems as long as you can slice things up into files in such a way that not every machine needs to pull the full model weights.Failing that there are P2P distribution mechanisms for OCI (Dragonfly etc) that can lessen the burden without resorting to DIY on Bittorrent or similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be aware of licensing restrictions. Docker Desktop is free for personal use, but it requires a paid license if you work for an organization sized 250+. This feature seems to be available in Docker Desktop only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why add another domain-specific command to a container manager and go out of scope for what the tool was designed for at first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643944</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny coincidental timing - I just played HHGTTG a couple of times last night for the first time in thirty+ years or so.I first played the game, way back - prior to having read the novel. It was mind-blowing. I had no idea what was going on but I got a real sense that it could be pretty funny if I did. So I read the novel eventually, and it was as good as I expected. I don't think I'd gone back to play the game until this week, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its interesting to see how developers get into a mindset, based on their life experience.What we're seeing here is 40 year old code compile and run with minimal effort. Largely because the C language has respected backwards compatibility.Yes, there were breaking changes along the way, but they were trivial to resolve in hours. And (more interesting) the author believed that to be true and so persevered.I saw this recently as well. I run a lot of programs on Windows. Many are 32 bit, written in the 90s for Windows 95, or 98. They all still run. Microsoft bends over backwards to keep things compatible.I also get to write a lot of web API clients. I tell customers that it won't work forever. Web APIs are constantly changing. The service (especially Google) will change something soon to break it.The people building those APIs are expecting only currently-maintained apps to run. They have no concept (or experience) of 40 or 30 year old code "just running". Crumbs, if you get 5 years out an API client you're doing well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone needs to do the sort of "fix up scattered declarations and move them to headers", you really want to use:  gcc -Werror=missing-declarations -Werror=redundant-decls

(last I checked, Clang's implementation of this was buggy and half-useless, but I'll admit I stopped using Clang)I recommend this for well-maintained code too, just as another way to keep the code smells away. For a lot of projects this will only require adding a bit of `static` that you were too lazy to write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677909</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Karen Wynn Fonstad, a cartographer from Wisconsin, has gained recognition for her detailed maps of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world, particularly "Middle-earth." Her work includes intricate illustrations that help fans better understand Tolkien's stories and settings. Fonstad's passion for mapping extends beyond fantasy, as she also creates educational maps and emphasizes the importance of geography in literature. Her unique contributions to the intersection of cartography and literature celebrate Tolkien's legacy and have solidified her position as a significant figure in both fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlas of Middle-earth is a truly monumental feat.I think the article writer misses how much of it is really about The Silmarillion, rather than about Lord of the Rings. Tolkien put a lot of work into First Age geography, an entire (interminable, excruciating) chapter of The Silmarillion. Very little of it would be familiar to viewers of the films, and a lot of it opaque even to readers just of LotR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A wonderful atlas -- my favorite are her trail maps where she depicts a character's daily journey in the book.The article (almost) footnotes her other work which was equally impressive:* She also created atlases for the worlds of fantasy authors Anne McCaffrey, creator of the “Dragonriders of Pern” series, and Stephen R. Donaldson, who wrote “The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant” series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love fantasy in general, and have read a ton of it. other than tolkien, I have never read a novel with that strong a sense of geography in a constructed world - specifically, that there is an entire rich land out there, and not just a graph of interesting places with the focus shifting from one point to another. when the hobbits have to go from the shire to rivendell, or aragorn has to take the paths of the dead to reach his destination in time, tolkien really manages to convey the experience of a difficult journey that takes a significant amount of time even when nothing plot-significant is happening along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43656267</guid></item><item><title>23.

I just wish they would update the extension on the firebase extensions hub[1] because the current version available uses node 14 which is not supported by cloud functions on GCP so the extension is not usable at all.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of entropy in various contexts, primarily in thermodynamics and information theory. It discusses entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, highlighting its significance in understanding energy distribution and transformations. The author also touches on how entropy relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Additionally, the article explores entropy's implications for data and information, illustrating how it quantifies uncertainty and information gain. Overall, the piece aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy and its relevance across different fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I throw these quotes by Y. Oono into the mix because they provide viewpoints which are in some tension with those who take -\sum_x p(x) log p(x) definition of entropy as fundamental.&gt; Boltzmann’s argument summarized in Exercise of 2.4.11 just derives Shannon’s formula and uses it. A major lesson is that before we use the Shannon formula important physics is over.&gt; There are folklores in statistical mechanics. For example, in many textbooks ergodic theory and the mechanical foundation of statistical mechanics are discussed even though detailed mathematical explanations may be missing. We must clearly recognize such topics are almost irrelevant to statistical mechanics. We are also brainwashed that statistical mechanics furnishes the foundation of thermodynamics, but we must clearly recognize that without thermodynamics statistical mechanics cannot be formulated. It is a naive idea that microscopic theories are always more fundamental than macroscopic phenomenology.sources:

http://www.yoono.org/download/smhypers12.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t see Sean Carroll’s musings mentioned yet, so repeating my previous comment:Entropy got a lot more exciting to me after hearing Sean Carroll talk about it. He has a foundational/philosophical bent and likes to point out that there are competing definitions of entropy set on different philosophical foundations, one of them seemingly observer dependent:
- https://youtu.be/x9COqqqsFtc?si=cQkfV5IpLC039Cl5
- https://youtu.be/XJ14ZO-e9NY?si=xi8idD5JmQbT5zxNLeonard Susskind has lots of great talks and books about quantum information and calculating the entropy of black holes which led to a lot of wild new hypotheses.Stephen Wolfram gave a long talk about the history of the concept of entropy which was pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/live/ocOHxPs1LQ0?si=zvQNsj_FEGbTX2R3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the last few months, I've been developing an unorthodox perspective on entropy [1] . It defines the phenomenon in much more detail, allowing for a unification of all forms of entropy. It also defines probability through the same lens.I define both concepts fundamentally in relation to priors and possibilities:- Entropy is the relationship between priors and ANY possibility, relative to the entire space of possibilities.- Probability is the relationship between priors and a SPECIFIC possibility, relative to the entire space of possibilities.The framing of priors and possibilities shows why entropy appears differently across disciplines like statistical mechanics and information theory. Entropy is not merely observer-dependent, but prior-dependent. Including priors not held by any specific observer but embedded in the framework itself. This helps resolve the apparent contradiction between objective and subjective interpretations of entropy.It also defines possibilities as constraints imposed on an otherwise unrestricted reality. This framing unifies how possibility spaces are defined across frameworks.[1]: https://buttondown.com/themeaninggap/archive/a-unified-persp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684560</guid></item><item><title>25.

And the "loving couple holding IA hands and then dancing", well, the input is already cringe enough.For all these diffusion models, look like we are 90% here, now we just need the final 90%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;really the next big leap is something that gives me more meaningful artistic control over these systems.It's usually "generate a few, one of them is not terrible, none are exactly what I wanted" then modify the prompt, wait an hour or so ...The workflow reminds me of programming 30 years ago - you did something, then waited for the compile, see if it worked, tried something else...All you've got are a few crude tools and a bit of grit and patience.On the i2v tools I've found that if I modify the input to make the contrast sharper, the shapes more discrete, the object easier to segment, then I get better results. I wonder if there's hacks like that here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video to audio examples are really impressive! The video featuring the band showcases some of the obvious shortcomings of this method (humans will have very precise expectations about the kinds of sounds 5 trombones will make)—but the tennis example shows its strengths (decent timing of hit sounds, eerily accurate acoustics for the large internal space). I'm very excited to see how this improves a few more papers down the line!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683907</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without arguing the merits of the Altera investment or divestment, a common pattern for Intel seems to be a wild see-sawing between an aggressive and a defensive market posture - it’s a regular occurrence for Intel to announce a bold new venture to try to claim some new territory, and just as regular that they announce they’re halting that venture in the name of “consolidating” and “focusing on their core.” The consequence is that they never give new ventures time to actually succeed, so they just bleed money creating things they murder in the cradle, and nobody born before last Tuesday is investing in bothering to learn the new Intel thing because its expected lifespan is shorter than the average Google product.Intel either needs to focus or they need to be bold (and I’d actually prefer they be bold - they’ve started down some cool paths over time), but what they really need is to make up their goddamn minds and stop panicking every other quarter that their “ten-year bets” from last quarter haven’t paid off yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rest in Peace Altera I guess? I still drink out of my color changing Altera mug (that's long stopped changing color) most days. PE ruins everything so it's only a matter of time before they're gutted and sold for scraps by the vultures at Silver Lake. (though honestly the writing was on the wall since the Intel acquisition I had held onto some hope) If only we had a functioning government interested in actually maintaining our technological dominance and enforcing/expanding antitrust legislation. I wrote my first Verilog on an Altera chip and I'll remember them fondly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's worked at Xilinx before and after the merger, it's a surprise they were even able to sell it for that much. Altera has been noncompetitive to Xilinx in performance and to Lattice in terms of low-end/low-power offerings for at least the last 2 generations.I'm concerned about the future of FPGAs and wonder who will lead the way to fix these abhorrent toolchains these FPGA companies force upon developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43686773</guid></item><item><title>27.

Docker is going to abuse the crap out of my ruleset/make me jump through extra hoops to have it work.Having the containers operate under systemd looks fine (ignoring the fact that it is systemd, I guess I have finally accepted systemd is here to stay).I was interested in using traefik &amp; docker labelling to have ingress sorted out and I believe this will all play nicely enough to replace docker-compose on a single server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683641</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The late PowerPC-era Macs are really fun to play with, because they're an interesting blend of modern niceties like USB and Ethernet but are limited with how old most software is. There's still a scene of people working on bringing newer versions of GCC and other *nix utilities to Tiger or Leopard, working with the pre-release PPC betas of Snow Leopard, and trying to keep online services working despite aging TLS versions and retired APIs. Compiling takes forever until it fails with an obscure C11 error or missing C library features. And that makes for a fun, if often frustrating, challenge.But PPC32 Linux support is quickly falling off. Gentoo isn't just used because it's fun to leave your lampshade iMac G4 compiling a kernel for days, but because it's one of the few distros still supporting the platform. There's unsupported testing repos for Debian (and maybe Ubuntu?) plus the up-and-coming Adelie. Otherwise your best bet is OpenBSD - FreeBSD and NetBSD usually lack precompiled ports, and FreeBSD has announced the next major release will almost definitely drop 32 bit PPC.The 64 bit G5 systems are much better supporte. I'm pretty sure they can boot ppc64le that many distros target. They're also even more modern - the final models had PCIe, SATA, and up to 16GB of DDR2 RAM. Sadly there's nothing modern about the power efficiency, nor the self-destructing water cooling system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of fun reading that.I'm a bit of a hoarder when it comes to technology, truth be told there's a certain rose tinted nostalgia that I get from thinking about early 00's technology.It was still the era where UI's felt immediate and snappy- that anything related to actual computation or internet was jank and slow, but it had a whiff of a hopeful future about it. Every PC upgrade made things more snappy back then... Now I dread upgrades.Hey ho.It's endearing to know that one more bit of early 00's technology has been given a new lease on life. Would be cool to write some native software for it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, that's me! (in the Discord screenshot)I think I took the PRAM battery and hard drive out because both were dead. But the RAM I cannot remember what happened, either me or someone else might've scavenged it for another project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677165</guid></item><item><title>30.

It's too bad, as it was interesting up to that point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of "Gadsby", a 50.000 word novel without the letter "e":https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678312</guid></item><item><title>31.

Still not sure why on Earth car manufacturers would not just release APIs open to all owners (basically issue API key based on VIN) and let them use it. For developers to build apps that will only require API key to be entered would be win/win for everyone....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty cool! It's extremely frustrating that they go through so much effort to block third party apps, but the solution of just downloading and emulating the android app is simoultaneously very clever and very straightforward. A nice reminder not to overthink simple things. Cheers on a project well done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the commitment to getting this to work at no cost, on principle. Many of my favourite personal projects have followed similar paths, and have often been fun challenges for that reason alone.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers using the KATRIN experiment have reported new findings that narrow down the mass of neutrinos, fundamental particles that have intrigued physicists for decades. The experiment, which involves studying the behavior of electrons emitted from tritium decay, has provided a more precise measurement, suggesting that neutrinos are lighter than previously thought. This advancement aids in understanding the role of neutrinos in the universe's formation and could have implications for particle physics and cosmology, particularly in developing theories beyond the Standard Model. The improved mass limit enhances our understanding of the universe’s structure and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This measurement was performed in a lab in Germany.  The main spectrometer of the apparatus used for the measurement was fabricated in Germany.  The delivery route was almost 9000 km.  https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/march-2007/deconstr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hm, one thing I’m unclear on is…Well, from what I understand, the mass eigenstates and the flavor eigenstates for neutrinos aren’t the same, so a mass eigenstate is a linear combination of the different flavor eigenstates, and a flavor eigenstate is a linear combination of the different mass eigenstates,But, in these experiments with the electron neutrino, which is a flavor eigenstate, well, it isn’t in a mass eigenstate, so, what does that say about the momentum and such?And like, when they use this to get a bound on the mass, is this like, a bound on the mass of the largest of the 3 mass eigenstates, or of the expected value of mass when in the electron neutrino flavor eigenstate, or what?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love to see KATRIN represented here. I am a student at the university this is at. The area (nothern campus) this is at is a bit secluded and normally not accessible to students but I managed to take part in a tour of the northern campus. I even got some points (ects) for it which is nice.It was really impressive. The whole northern campus is full of giant science experiments like this one, old nuclear test reactors and so much more. I'm glad I got the opportunity to see it. They even got an entire water treatment plant, direct heating and direct cooling networks and produces more electricity than it uses on average.I was really fascinated by the scale of everything. The direct heating plant for example uses a few giant room sized gas-burning generators and uses their excess heat. But just for backup, in case gas drops out there are also 2-3 absolutely massive tanks next to the building that hold something like 2 million or so liters diesel fuel each, just as a backup. One of the technicians joked "yeah, we fill up a few thousand liters now and then when its cheap"All in all absolutely amazing experience and really cool campus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648922</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the most commonly-cited (but not actually all that practical) example for rejection sampling is estimating the value of pi (as hinted by the first example under uniform random sampling): generate two random numbers between 0 and 1, then check the fraction of points that satisfy x^2 + y^2 &lt;= 1. As number of samples tends to infinity, this will converge to pi/4. (You can instead take x,y from (-1,1) if you want to generate points on the full circle.)&gt; However, rejection sampling is only efficient when f_Omega can make use of a significant proportion of the probability density in f_D.Perhaps a more relevant example: the unit n-sphere encloses a vanishing amount of volume as the number of dimensions increases.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ballThis is one of those weird consequences that gets labeled as the curse of dimensionality, especially in ML contexts."As the dimension d of the space increases, the hypersphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the hypercube."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality#Distan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly related, I once created an app that calculate the volume of a random shape using Monte Carlo https://github.com/victorqribeiro/monteCarlo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681990</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To embed a binary in esp-idf I believe you need something like:    create_resources(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../binaries/RAM_APP ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/binaries.c)
    set_property(SOURCE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/binaries.c PROPERTY GENERATED 1)

Or using `EMBED_FILES`I just happened to be looking at this very thing today that had to do this: https://github.com/espressif/esp-serial-flasher/blob/master/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go for the SPI version, which is the same chip but just s different breakout board.Many ESP32's can only do 400kHz I2C, whereas their SPI peripheral can often do 80 MHz or more (although you wouldn't want to go that fast here). 400kHz sort of works, but if you also want to handle other I2C devices it can easily become a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really love the SSD1306 for its educational value. If you've bought a sensor kit for Arduino or ESP32 or Pico or whatever, chances are decent that you already have an SSD1306 lying around. There's so much example code for it. And the datasheet was pretty easy to grok IMO. My first exposure to it was in the pico-examples repo: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/i2c...There's a few Rust libraries for it, too.

Essentially every day started out with making a quick grammar to parse the problem into whatever data structures I was using. It's intuitive, pretty easy to pick up and adjust, and powerful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a fan of PEG. It is straightforward to write a fast parser generator for languages that require just one character of lookahead to disambiguate any alternation in the grammar. This gets you most of the expressivity of PEG and nearly optimal performance (since you only need to look at one character to disambiguate and there is no backtracking). Just as importantly, it avoids the implicit ambiguities that PEG's resolution algorithm can hide from the grammar author that lead to unexpected parse results that can be quite difficult to debug and/or fix in the grammar.It does require a bit more thought to design an unambiguous language but I think it's worth it. While there is a learning curve for designing such languages, it becomes natural with practice and it becomes hard to go back to ambiguous languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649781</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are several advantages to intrusive node-based data structures that I haven't seen stated in the article or the comments:- the same object can move between containers with no allocation and no need for a dedicated complex API- the same object can be part of multiple containers at once; particularly useful for intrusive binary trees, for indexing data with different criteria.- the container can be fully polymorphic, no need for all elements to be the same dynamic type.- no need for complex allocators, you can just store the objects as you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The new version isn't generic. Rather, you embed the linked list node with your data. This is known as an intrusive linked list and tends to perform better and require fewer allocations.I don’t get this. In the generic version the data is embedded with the linked list node, so there’s only one allocation per node. ‘T’ isn’t a pointer (or doesn’t have to be) there’s no indirection between data and node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like a net negative result. It removes some of the complexity of using generics, but it couples between the data type and the collections it can be indexed by.What are the benefits of this approach? Is it limited to data alignment, or is it out of a greater desire to remove generics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679707</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So story time.I've been hosting a DnD campaign with a group of college friends for almost a decade at this point. Since we've all moved away, we use Tabletop Simulator to play weekly.In one of my adventures, the players met a creature named Dorian with the same backstory as the classic tale The Picture of Dorian Gray. Later, the players discovered the secret to the creature's immortality was an indestructible painting of the creature.Nearly a month before encountering this creature, my players had explored a random dungeon I’d made where one of the rooms had a huge, ornate mirror on the wall. It made everything in the reflection appear older, covered in a layer of cobwebs and dust.Although this was not the primary solution to defeating Dorian, I laid subtle clues to see if anyone would remember that far back. Well, one of them did in fact remember the dungeon. They stole the painting and brought it back to the dungeon along with a secondary mirror. They then placed the mirrors across from each other along with the painting to create a sort of “hall of mirrors” effect on the painting itself, which caused the painting of Dorian to accelerate in age—creating a feedback loop that infinitely aged Dorian (think drinking from the wrong Holy Grail).It was amazingly satisfying to all my players, and it's also the exact sort of thing that I don't think the current batch of SOTA LLMs (even with the temperature cranked to 1) would ever think of in a MILLION years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using an LLM as DM Assistant for almost a year, now, by way of EchoDelphi[0], a tool we built at a public weekend hackathon[1].It listens to the game, then sends the transcript for inference. I've been prompting the LLM to generate "threats" and "setbacks" based on the current scenario, and that way I always have something handy when the dice[2] indicate fortunes' turn.I use this for about three hours a week, 50+ weeks in a row. Pretty good for a weekend hack!0. Https://EchoDelphi.github.io1. Thank you Hacker Dojo, Mtn. View2. https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FyXSpsn-z28/WgfgacmVdtI/AAAAAAAAA...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would really like to see what a reasoning model with access to player character information, resources available in the location, and the monster manual could do. One of the hardest things as a DM, in my experience, is creating a balanced encounter without fudging. This has always made it hard for me to justify presenting a truly deadly encounter which I feel has lowered the stakes of the game. It seems like it should be possible to create a system that knows the strengths/weaknesses of a party and that could create a challenging but not overwhelming encounter most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677265</guid></item><item><title>39.

This is meaningless. The only thing that matters in this kind of application is false negative rate at some acceptable false positive rate.I assume whoever is working on this knows that, so this is mostly a criticism of the article.

Setting up a quick local HTML server can be annoying.Alas it looks like it's web/electron based. :/ Downloading it and yep, 443.8 MB on MacOS. The Linux one is a bit better at 183.3 MB.Electron really should get a kickback from disk manufacturers! ;)Shameless plug, I've been working on a HTML inspired lightweight UI toolkit because I'm convinced we can make these sort of apps and they should only be ~10-20 MB [1] with nice syntax, animation, theming, etc. I'm finally making a suite of widgets. Maybe I can make a basic clone of this! Bet I could get in &lt; 10MB. :)1: https://github.com/elcritch/figuro&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often have the requirement, during development cycles, to bring up a static Webserver. After trying several options I always happily come back to the PHP built-in Webserver:php -S localhost:8080Many helpful options are available, just check the docs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks nice with a friendly UI. I've been very happy with Caddy[1], but this seems like something I might recommend to someone that is new to the web environment.[1] https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/static-files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684009</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're wondering what a 32-bit descendant of the 6502 might have looked like, especially one that incorporated the "radical simplicity" ideas of RISC alongside the radical simplicity of the original 6502, there's already an era-appropriate design you can study: the original 32-bit ARM.In an 2014 interview¹ with the Computer History Museum, Bill Mensch said:&gt; We think of ARM as our prodigal son. Got to do what they got to do, and it's not something I want to do, but I'm proud of them. They started with my technology, and I wish them well.¹: https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/20...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with just the 65C816, the register modes (8 or 16) bit can be a challenge to work with. When working on the PANCAKE-ROM project, I got bit by mixing up what mode the CPU was in while writing some memory locations. The memory manipulation was assumed to be in 16 bit mode, but it was 8 bit. The 65C832 makes this even more rough.I've done a little 65816 coding and I quickly learned that it was best to standardize on register sizes throughout most of the code and for routine calls, only switching to optimize things. 8-bit A and 16-bit X and Y made the most sense by far for small-scale asm code. It let you work in 8 bits when dealing with registers and using common 8-bit variables, while being able to loop over larger data structures with X and Y as memory addresses and counters, and also manipulate 16-bit values to some degree (copying, incrementing/decrementing).Other common CPUs of the time instead either had different registers names for different sizes (80x86), or coded the size in the instruction (68000). This avoided the mode bits and issues with code written for different modes (which even affected instruction length of the 65816 when using immediate data).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The W65C816 is a 16 bit version of the 6502 CPU.The 32 bit version, called the W65C832, only exists as a datasheet 
This is a FPGA version."builds with the regular opensource FPGA tools: yosys, nextpnr-ice40, icepack, and iceFUNprog. I recently added support for the Tang Nano 20k board (should work with the 9k model too)"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43658417</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the vulnerabilities associated with the HTTP/2 protocol, specifically focusing on potential security threats that arise from its implementation. It explains how certain features of HTTP/2 can be exploited by attackers to execute Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other malicious activities. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these vulnerabilities for developers and system administrators, advising on best practices to mitigate risks and enhance the overall security posture when using HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

And there's no an actual unencrypted HTTP/2 traffic, so there's no incentive to censor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The obvious follow-up is to then put a (possibly obfuscated) TLS connection in the request and response bodies, creating another tunneling method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684492</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One theme that pops out to me here is the reliance on other people being a positive experience for the author. In the software field, we tend to live pretty high up the economic value chain, which can abstract us a bit from participation in the more grassroots co-operative aspect of society. This can be alienating and warp worldview.When I'm hitchhiking to support packrafting trips or get back to where I launched my paraglider, I have no say in who I'm going to be chatting with and feeling gratitude towards. Initially that feeling of being reliant on whoever comes my way was difficult to adjust to after the false sense of individualism that a high paying job in a bubble of similar people brings.The benefit though is enormous. Now I stop to help anyone who's broken down on the side of the road despite the flash judgements their car or bumper stickers might bring. I'm much more aware of the value and interconnectedness of our society, and feel inspired to actively seek to contribute instead of remaining aloof. Most importantly, I realize that there's a whole lot of people out there looking to help people out at any turn, and that gives me a lot of faith.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that finding free camping outside when you are in some shit nothing town is probably the most important skill to have, which is easy with satellite maps. Once you get the hang of it you realize that every town has at least one site where you can definitely get away with pitching a tent for one night. I think I have camped this way about 80 times and have never even been asked what I'm doing. That said, state and national park campgrounds are a great deal and you sometimes meet other tourers there, so they're good for a day when you want to take it easy for a morning. I sometimes get a kick out of zooming in on nowhere, USA and looking for spots.And some advice for anyone doing this for the first time and feels compelled to pay to camp - never stay at a KOA, consider them an absolute last resort. There is no bigger waste of money and RV culture is extremely cursed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Props to the author for grinding through this, but I think a very strongly worded and formatted warning is needed at the top. Embarking on this trip with so little knowledge meant putting yourself far away from civilizations while criminally underprepared.I love the energy of Supertramps, but there is a reason they are controversial. It would be very easy to make a mistake and be in big trouble - underestimating water needs in a barren stretch, a hole in your tire (not tube) and not knowing how to fix it, etc. it’s pure luck you didn’t not over exert a small muscle or ligament locking you out of cycling during recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681936</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a humorous take on finance and investing, particularly highlighting the concept of "stonks," a meme that symbolizes the rise of stock prices and investment trends. It features a variety of stock market statistics, charts, and advice, often presented in a light-hearted and accessible manner.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone else reading this knows about the equivalent of US "pink sheets," publicly traded companies that have either never been listed or have been delisted due to low share price / market capitalization.Here in the US, you can buy publicly traded companies in the US for a song; in fact, that was the source for the "acquiring" company in a lot of those reverse-acquisitions of the late 2000s / early 2010s: publicly traded companies that had a ticker, but were basically defunct. A company that wanted to go public without the scrutiny of an IPO process could "buy themselves" with the tiny, publicly traded company, thereby getting a ticker and access to retail investors. (This was not a good phenomenon, fwiw, though it definitely anticipated the SPAC craze... which was also not good, for similar reasons.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies like these are hard to find in the US because of the twin curses (or joys, depending on your views) of "maximizing shareholder value" and "SEC regulation".If you list on a big exchange, your investors will expect revenue and profit to go brrr quarter after quarter forever. It's a treadmill you can never get off. Amazon is uniquely special in that Bezos persuaded investors to keep faith for the best part of a decade. Or perhaps "lucky": one wonders what their stock price would have done without the incredible luck of the former side hustle of AWS becoming the engine of their business. (Not to denigrate the incredible feat that it is, or the work that went into it.)Regulation provides some practical limits on how small you can be, too. All those 10-Ks and audits and SOX compliance don't come cheap. You need to be big enough to employ specialists to do it or rich enough to partner up with Deloitte.The alternative is to list on a pink sheet exchange, but then you are keeping company with a long long tail of companoes that give off sketchy vibes. A one man Nevada corporation selling healing oils, or an interest in a hitherto-undiscovered source of limitless energy. I cant think of any company that graduated from this part of the market into full DJI/Nasdaq respectability. Maybe someone knows of one?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before Covid I thought I'd chuck a few hundred dollars into a trading app to understand that 'game' a little bit better. I chose a few companies I knew from work and some biotechs that had fun ticker names. One company had 'mRNA' which I thought was funny, so I bought 50 dollars of stock.Turns out mRNA stands for Moderna and I wish I put in more than 50 dollars as it went from ~$19 to almost ~$400 per share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678988</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on a similar system at Google for gboard, the Google branded android keyboard that we called “federated analytics” - it worked with device-to-device communication and invertable bloom lookup tables. I’m still not super sure how the Apple system works after reading it, but I don’t see ant mention of using data structures like that, instead they are polling the devices themselves it seems? Does anyone else have more insight to the mechanics, because that seems super inefficient?https://research.google/blog/improving-gboard-language-model...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This approach works by randomly polling participating devices for whether they’ve seen a particular fragment, and devices respond anonymously with a noisy signal. By noisy, we mean that devices may provide the true signal of whether a fragment was seen or a randomly selected signal for an alternative fragment or no matches at all. By calibrating how often devices send randomly selected responses, we ensure that hundreds of people using the same term are needed before the word can be discoverable. As a result, Apple only sees commonly used prompts, cannot see the signal associated with any particular device, and does not recover any unique prompts. Furthermore, the signal Apple receives from the device is not associated with an IP address or any ID that could be linked to an Apple Account. This prevents Apple from being able to associate the signal to any particular device.The way I read this, there's no discovery mechanism here, so Apple has to guess a priori which prompts will be popular. How do they know what queries to send?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Improving GenmojiI find it odd that they keep insisting on this to the point that it's the very first example. I'm willing to bet 90% of users don't use genmoji and the 10% who have used it on occasion mostly do it for the lulz at how bizarre the whole thing is.It seems to me that they don't really have a vision for Apple Intelligence, or at least not a compelling one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43685714</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprisingly enough, this partially exposes the link between depression and some of the autoimmunal diseases. One example is how patients with psoriasis have significantly elevated levels of proteins from the IL-17 family (namely, IL-17A, IL-17C, and IL-17F) - up to 4 to 8 times above nominal values.At the same time, bimekizumab, one of the bleeding-edge psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatments, suppresses production of IL-17A and IL-17F (methotrexate does that, too, albeit to a much smaller degree). As a result, people receiving IL-17 suppressors become happier over the course of years, and not only due to months-long remission - I had a chance to see this in one of the experimental treatment programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a study a while ago, the study found common vitamin deficiency in depressed humans.I researched more about it and looks like some of the deficiency in the vitamins in the study are correlated with higher IL-17 levels.Carnitine: Seems to have some effect in decreasing IL-17?Vitamin D: Highly impacts IL-17 (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4609465/)COQ10: Decreased plasma levels of IL-17 (https://www.clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(22...)Folic Acid: Reduces IL-17 (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8839991/)Lutein: I didn't find any study that seems to study the effect on IL-17Citrulline: No relevant studiesThis is the study I'm referring to: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-023-02696-9I think we're getting closer to find some blood level correlations, so we can fix them!I can say for a fact when I take CoQ10, I feel my energy levels going up so it really has some effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related paper on receptors: https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00279-XPaper suggesting mood alteration: https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00278-8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682686</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun thing to study and read about. The differences are quite small though. Wouldn't the error bars dwarf the differences? I'd assume you could tweak various assumptions and easily arrive at another conclusion.I know that the Romans were good at record keeping for their time. But I understand the best population estimates for the Roman empire are based on economic metrics like agricultural modeling which in turn must make assumptions about wealth distribution. As for the Han, I don't think they've left us a complete census either.To quote "How Many People? Ancient Demography" [0]:&gt; We generally estimate uncounted women, children and elderly males by using demographic modeling based on model life tables – data tables which project mortality simulations based on real-world populations. But how do you know what tables to use? The answer here has typically been that you comb the evidence you have (grave inscriptions, fragmentary census records that survive in Egypt) to create a statistical snapshot of your population and then try to match that, as best you can, to one of the extant models that ‘best fits.’ [...]&gt; That leaves the question of how many enslaved persons and those too poor to be counted in some of our figures.[0] https://acoup.blog/2023/12/22/collections-how-many-people-an...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there some assumption here that inequality is bad? Or that there's some ideal number? Or that there's a meaningful comparison with modern economies?I see "inequality" as a concept like "uncertainty", it can be pointed to as the source of social and economic issues, but only is undesirable that rain is seen as undesirable weather. Nobody likes being on the wrong end of these, but they are inevitable and natural (to some extent) and I think we're better off trying to acheive a society that works with an equilibrium wealth distribution. Umbrellas rather than weather control machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the first two maps, there seems to be little difference between income per capita and income inequality: the regions with greater per capita income also show greater inequality. Is this because some people always end up at zero no matter the region, so that increasing per capita income from X (lower) to Y (higher) stretches the ranges of income from zero to Y and thus increases disparity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642568</guid></item><item><title>48.

It has very few opinions about your code and happily assumes that you know exactly what you're doing. Freedom with responsibility.I love C because it doesn't make my life very inconvenient to protect me from stubbing my toe in it. I hate C when I stub my toe in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  #define hc_task_yield(task)

  } while (0) 


That's just diabolical. I would not have thought to write "case __LINE__". In the case of a macro, using __LINE__ twice expands to the same value where the macro is used, even if the macro has newlines. It makes sense, but TIL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reason I believe C is and always will be important is that it stands in a class of its own as a mostly portable assembler language, offering similar levels of freedom.When your computer is a PDP-11, otherwise it is a high level systems language like any other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679781</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is meta, but I really hate the way this post is written. It's full of the "startup cool" aesthetic, which I'm really averse to.The main elements of the aesthetic that I can pinpoint are things like everything being a superlative ("security leaders" instead of just "people who work in security", "legendary investors" instead of just "experienced/well-known investors"), the bullet format, heavy use of buzzwords when more everyday words would do, etc.It comes off as trying to elicit a fake "let's all get hyped up and build unicorn moonshots wooo" feeling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Of course, in retrospect, Wiz had many key ingredients working in their favor:&gt;Strong, proven founding team (Adallom founders + Microsoft Cloud Security Leadership)
Great, sticky product
Solving deeply felt pain point(s)
Timing (founded just as the world goes remote due to COVID-19 + cloud boom)
Legendary investors + network effects (Sequoia Capital, Cyberstarts, Index Ventures etc.)
Lots of early funding ($480M+ within a year of emerging from stealth )
Relentless executionWhy is nearly half a billion in funding so far down on the list?That’s probably the most important factor here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Lots of early funding ($480M+ within a year of emerging from stealth )&gt; By May 2023, ARR reached $200M, and by February 2024, it was $350MThere is little substance about how the invested money was absorbed and how that absorption led to such an ARR. Did it pay for integrations and hand holding for each contract? Or was it used to bluntly bribe the CISOs to use their product?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678123</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting ... it's presented in the context of drugs for curing infections.I wonder if this is being used for other drugs.  My curiosity stems from personal experience: I had Migraine headaches from age 17 to about 35.  I was put on ancient seizure medication that's common prescribed for Bipolar[0] because this doctor had three other patients that it nearly eliminated Migraine from.  It was fall, a time when I'd get about one a week.  After five days of taking it, I had my first Migraine ... if you could call it that -- I could only identify that it was a Migraine by the aura; the pain was about 10% what I'm used to).Searching through the web, I found a forum that was filled with Migraine sufferers.  Sure enough, there were a handful of people who swore by it.  There were also a handful of people who it didn't work for.  Looking at the more official sources, there was no indication that this drug could have any effect on Migraine; they listed all of the other off-label uses[1], but Migraine was not among them.This medication had been in the news several times (and on the front page, here[2]) over the last few years and a year ago (or so), I looked it up on the "official sources", again.  It now indicated that it was prescribed for Migraine.It made me wonder ... how are things like that figured out/communicated down-stream?  Is it entirely informally amongst doctors?  I went to four different specialists before I found one who suggested this drug -- and he did so in a "half-hearted manner" not truly expecting it would work.  It'd be nice if this was centrally tracked/managed as it might surface both "new uses for old drugs" and "new problems with old drugs."[0] Which I do not have.[1] It's rarely, if ever, prescribed for what it was originally approved for.[2] It's Depakote, I'm not being cagey for nefarious purposes, I just didn't want this to be a drug advertisement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just today I read about this in the book "Who is Government" by Michael Lewis where he presents the case on how it can help find cure for rare diseases. You can read his article at https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2025/mic....Also highly recommend the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many interesting, off-label novel uses for drugs that have already been developed. Recently my wife &amp; I adopted a kitten that developed FIP, a disease caused by a feline coronavirus that was nearly 100% fatal up until just a few years ago.Turns out, a drug developed by Gilead Sciences (GS-441524) which is the active metabolite of remdesivir, is remarkably effective at treating the disease. It's a nucleoside analog, so it essentially is a slightly modified adenosine molecule which disrupts the virus RNA replication process.Within 12 hours of the first dose our cat went from dying to making a full turnaround and complete recovery following treatment. For us it was truly a miracle drug, and it only gained awareness recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. It still isn't technically "approved" for this use case, but is prescribed off-label by vets as of 2024 once the FDA relaxed its position [2]. Folks needed to seek it out on the black market (and still do in some areas).[1] https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/remdesiv...[2] https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-announ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648649</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article offers humorous and insightful strategies for effectively communicating with toddlers during arguments. It emphasizes the importance of staying calm, using simple language, and understanding a child's perspective. The author provides practical tips for redirecting the conversation, validating feelings, and using creative approaches to resolve disputes, ultimately aiming to foster better parent-child interactions while acknowledging the unique challenges of dealing with young children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oddly, I thought this discussion would be about actual toddlers.There is a way to win an argument with a toddler. You find out what's bothering them, usually something emotional, and you validate it. "Yes! It's fun to stay up late! Yes! You don't want to eat your vegetables!" Once they feel heard, you've got a shot at getting them to do what you want.That's a good way to win an argument with a non-toddler as well. Acknowledge that what they want is legitimate (if it is). Concede points of agreement. Talk about shared goals. Only then talk about a different path to the solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody ever changes their opinion on things with anything remotely like a high degree of frequency, and that's not a particularly bad thing. The "real" point of an argument is not to persuade the other side (though that is what you aspire to nonetheless) but to exchange views, and often to indirectly explore your own views more deeply, at least in the scenario where your 'partner' can bring up something you weren't aware of.Our views actually shifting is something that only happens over many years and often for reasons we aren't really in control of. Me of 10 years ago would vehemently disagree with me of today on many things, and there's probably pretty much no argument I could have engaged with him to persuade him of what I obviously think are 'more correct' views. It required, most of all, life experience that isn't going to be able to be communicated with words. If it were we'd all have the wisdom of a man who'd lived for millennia. And if not all of us, then at least somebody - but that somebody doesn't exist.One who wants to debate while rejecting the real state of mankind is oft going to just find themselves in an echo chamber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the surprising benefits of raising a toddler is gaining the ability to instantly tell when another adult has fallen into a "toddler-like" state (myself included!).Before having kids, I would try and explain someone's behavior in a logical sense.Toddlers, however, are mostly driven by their current physical needs (hungry/sleepy) and whatever they're currently doing (autonomy).We've found the most success in avoiding all boolean questions. Do you want to read a book? (when playing with trains before bedtime) Obvious no!Do you want to read this book or that book? Oh... a decision!It's striking how well tactics like these work outside the realm of toddlers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43693402</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a certain amount of irony that people try really hard to say that hallucinations are not a big problem anymore and then a company that would benefit from that narrative gets directly hurt by it.Which of course they are going to try to brush it all away. Better than admitting that this problem very much still exists and isn’t going away anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Cursor cofounder)Apologies - something very clearly went wrong here. We’ve already begun investigating, and some very early results:* Any AI responses used for email support are now clearly labeled as such. We use AI-assisted responses as the first filter for email support.* We’ve made sure this user is completely refunded - least we can do for the trouble.For context, this user’s complaint was the result of a race condition that appears on very slow internet connections. The race leads to a bunch of unneeded sessions being created which crowds out the real sessions. We’ve rolled out a fix.Appreciate all the feedback. Will help improve the experience for future users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor sucks. Not as a product. As a team. Their customer support is terrible.I was offered in writing a refund by the team who cold reached out to me to ask me why I cancelled my sub one week after start. Then they ignored my 3+ emails in response asking them to refund, and other means of trying to communicate with them. Offering me a refund as a bait to gain me back, then when I accept it they ghost me. Wow. Very low.The product is not terrible but the team responses are. And this, if you see how they handled it, is also a very poor response. First thing you notice if you open the link is that the Cursor team removed the reddit post! As if we were not going to see it or something? Who do they think they are? Censoring bad comments which are 100% legit.I am giving it a go to competitors just out of sheer frustration with how they handle customers, and I do recommend everybody to explore other products before you settle on Cursor. I don't intend to ever re-subscribe and have recommended friends to do the same, most of which agree with my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683012</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First off, dont look at the outer wilds discussion on here, just play the game. Second - they didnt say how many letters we need to encode all of the observable supernova in a given year! So 100 billion galaxies, 1 per year per galaxy, we have around 1 billion to encode. Sorry two edits this moring, first one was right. due to math without coffee. 1e9/26^6 is about 3, 1e9/26^7 is less than one. So we might see 'SN2050aaaaaah'!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's one of my favourite hints in Outer Wilds. You will see a Supernova. Not with a fancy telescope, it's visible to the naked eye, and if you watch the sky you'll see another  soon enough. You can see this right at the start, and unlike the random direction of the probe launch you don't need any game lore to, if you're smart enough, put two and two together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really feel like this article should also mention the rate of formation of new stars. According to [1] Universe Magazine the James Webb telescope has revealed that more than 3,000 stars are formed every second.[1] https://universemagazine.com/en/james-webb-comes-closer-to-r...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661954</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) related to a complaint filed against Tesla and Elon Musk, which centers on the firing of a worker who supported union efforts and the use of social media. The NLRB concluded that Musk’s actions violated labor laws, specifically regarding the worker's rights. The article also touches on the broader implications for labor relations at large tech companies and highlights ongoing tensions between management and employees advocating for better labor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This part is really damning: a real efficiency audit might need a lot of access to look for signs of hidden activity, but they’d never need to hide traces of what they did:&gt; Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.The subsequent message about Russian activity could be a coincidence–Internet background noise-but given how these are not very technically skilled and are moving very fast in systems they don’t understand, I’d be completely unsurprised to learn that they unintentionally left something exposed or that one of them has been compromised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Non-American here.) If they weren't already, it seems like private businesses, security researchers, and I suppose the general public, should start treating US government agencies as privacy and security threats, just like you'd treat any other phisher, scammer, etc.If government agencies are compromised - via software backdoors or any other mechanism - any data and systems they can access should be considered compromised too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unfortunate reality is that a half of the US population sees the NLRB as a burden on small businesses—primarily because its policies shift frequently, making compliance costly and complex for those without deep legal resources. [1]And the same half of the population do not trust anything what npr.org says.Understanding the above dynamic is key to grasping the current state of discourse in the U.S.[1] https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?Docum...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43691142</guid></item><item><title>5. 4chan Sharty Hack And Janitor Email Leak</title><link>https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/april-2025-4chan-sharty-hack-and-janitor-email-leak</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article details the events surrounding the "April 2025 4chan Sharty Hack and Janitor Email Leak," which involved a significant security breach on the online forum 4chan. The incident resulted in the unauthorized release of internal emails from 4chan's janitorial staff, exposing various operational communications and responses to issues on the site. The article highlights the reactions from the community, the implications for online privacy, and the broader context of hacking incidents within internet culture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did some digging and the hacker posted which exploit he used.Apparently some boards allowed uploading PDF files, but the site never checked if the PDF file was an actual PDF file. Once a PDF file was uploaded it was passed to a version of Ghostscript from 2012 which would generate a thumbnail. So the attacker found an exploit where uploading a PDF with the right PostScript commands could give the attacker shell access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel too many people conflate /pol/ with the whole website. I enjoyed browsing through sfw boards like /tg/ (tabletop media), /ck/ (cooking) and /fit/ (fitness). I had long discussions about the SW sequels on /tv/ back in 2015-19. The readership was surprisingly diverse and the anonymity lead users to provide more focused replies. With bodybuilding.com gone, the blue boards felt like the last bastion of the old internet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The take on 4chan on here is super intriguing. I always felt that the current social media/doomscroll/memesharing landscape which has become so common worldwide is indiscernable and in some ways worse than 4chan. It feels like 4chan left it's homepage and went worldwide sometime in the early 2010s when iPhone-style phone use became more commonplace.I remember that 4chan users had more honor than users on the internet today. One example would be 4Chan's "Not your personal army" mentality vs. the widespread doxxing/"call their place of employment!" witch hunts, driven by huge accounts on IG/Tiktok/etc, that hit normal people daily.The modern social media landscape has become far more hectic, harmful, and downright scary than 4chan. Dodging explicit imagery is harder on Instagram's explore page than on 4chan, and the widespread popularization of OF creators has zero bounds across the socials. DOXXING is no longer frowned upon and now commonplace. And memes have become less unique and funny and more commoditized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43691334</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive tool that helps users explore their feelings of uncertainty regarding various topics. It invites users to assess their levels of unsurety by selecting from a range of questions and scenarios. The tool aims to facilitate self-reflection and encourage users to articulate their uncertainties, providing insights into personal decision-making processes and emotional responses. Through its user-friendly interface, the site promotes a deeper understanding of how uncertainty impacts daily life and choices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this!In the grand HN tradition of being triggered by a word in the post and going off on a not-quite-but-basically-totally-tangential rant:There’s (at least) three areas here that are footguns with these kinds of calculations:1) 95% is usually a lot wider than people think - people take 95% as “I’m pretty sure it’s this,” whereas it’s really closer to “it’d be really surprising if it were not this” - by and large people keep their mental error bars too close.2) probability is rarely truly uncorrelated - call this the “Mortgage Derivatives” maxim. In the family example, rent is very likely to be correlated with food costs - so, if rent is high, food costs are also likely to be high. This skews the distribution - modeling with an unweighted uniform distribution will lead to you being surprised at how improbable the actual outcome was.3) In general normal distributions are rarer than people think - they tend to require some kind of constraining factor on the values to enforce. We see them a bunch in nature because there tends to be negative feedback loops all over the place, but once you leave the relatively tidy garden of Mother Nature for the chaos of human affairs, normal distributions get pretty abnormal.I like this as a tool, and I like the implementation, I’ve just seen a lot of people pick up statistics for the first time and lose a finger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have written similar tools- for command line, fermi: https://git.nunosempere.com/NunoSempere/fermi- for android, a distribution calculator: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nunosempere.distribution...People might also be interested in https://www.squiggle-language.com/, which is a more complex version (or possibly &lt;https://git.nunosempere.com/personal/squiggle.c&gt;, which is a faster but much more verbose version in C)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interval/affine arithmetic are alternatives which do not make use of probabilities for this these kinds of calculations.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmeticI think arbitrary distribution choice is dangerous. You're bound to end up using lots of quantities that are integers, or positive only (for example). "Confidence" will be very difficult to interpret.Does it support constraints on solutions? E.g. A = 3~10, B = 4 - A, B &gt; 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43690289</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the workings of one-time passwords (OTPs), a security mechanism used to enhance authentication processes. It discusses how OTPs are generated—either through time-sensitive algorithms or event-based systems—and emphasizes their advantages in preventing unauthorized access. The content also covers the various methods for delivering OTPs, such as SMS, email, and authenticator apps, and highlights their importance in multi-factor authentication. Additionally, potential vulnerabilities and best practices for implementing OTP systems are addressed to ensure user security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Six-digit verification codes for something like a "forgot password" flow are OTPs -- they're only good for one login -- but they are not HOTP/TOTPs. HOTP/TOTP has a registration step, where you copy a server-generated secret to your phone through a QR-code-encoded otpauth:// URI (https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-...). That doesn't happen in a "forgot password" flow.Incidentally, if you think of TOTP as being HMAC(unix mod 30, secret), one idea would be to do public key crypto instead of symmetric HMAC stuff. That's basically what a security key is.If you additionally made it so that you couldn't phish the security key -- by having the OS + web browser know which apps can ask for which security keys -- you'd have reinvented WebAuthn.P.S.: Make you sure you have stuffing protection in place against these kinds of six-digit-code auth schemes. A million possibilities is often acceptable for a secondary factor, but it's useless if attackers can just try all million codes.Since they're in the thread, nice article 'dogacel! I've never seen an article on this that also took the time to dig into HMAC internals and that gnarly DT function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a bit terse, but there is a 20-line Python implementation which cleared up the ideas for me: https://github.com/susam/mintotp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Also in some examples like Facebook's password recovery, this secret clock is not shared with the user directly but rather server's generated one-time password is sent via a trusted medium, such as an email to the user.I’m pretty sure Facebook just makes up a random number and stores it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653322</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if we can look forward to the end of the letter soup brands on Amazon, it's ridiculously difficult finding real brands in between them.That would be one silver lining in all this mess, at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved temu, aliexpress, and shein. I probably averaged 1 item per day arriving to my house, for years and years. Mostly little electronics parts and specialized tools for my workshop. Buying from Amazon or locally would have cost me 10x as much. Obviously it's over now. Anyone getting a package in May will be hit with a $75-$150 or more bill per package, even a 75 cent envelope will be charged +$75. I feel bad for the unaware people still ordering. I'm surprised the websites don't even acknowledge this yet. I guess they are hoping for a reversal in the next 2 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good. They're pushing overpriced low-quality junk. If you want to buy from Temu but want a better chance at reasonable prices, shop AliExpress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43687495</guid></item><item><title>9.

As a lesser known example, JSLinux's terminal emulator was forked a few times and is now known as xterm.js, which has become the predominant web embeddable terminal emulator.This all comes full circle, because now I'm building a true successor to JSLinux that's way faster because I've natively compiled the kernel/userspace to wasm, and of course I'm using xterm.js for the terminal emulation.If you like buggy demos that probably shouldn't be shared yet, you should check out https://linux.tombl.dev, but note that it's currently just a busybox shell and nothing else, so I hope you're good with `echo *` instead of `ls`.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fabrice is amazing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ultimate long term solution --- refuse to buy any home product that defies local control.If a wifi password is required to make full use of the device, I will return it.If some users want to sacrifice security and privacy for "convenience", that's on them. But if you want to sell me the product, at least provide the option to decline without loss of functionality.  Otherwise, no sale.As an example, I refuse to buy a doorbell camera that doesn't support RTSP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The result of this process is that the air purifier boosts when the air quality inside drops.I feel like that is something that doesn’t or at least shouldn’t require a string of IoT devices, apps, wireless communication and hubs. Why not leave all of that out and just attach an air quality sensor to the air purifier and a small LCD to adjust the settings?The light in my hallway turns on automatically when I walk past. No cloud, no HomeAssist, no WiFi, no Zigbee, no apps, no batteries to change. Just a motion sensor hardwired to the light fixture. Hasn’t failed me once in the past ten years. Works great even if the network goes down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For vendors of ESP32-based IoT devices:  Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

&gt; My intentions were solely to upgrade the smart device I've purchased to integrate with my smart home system. Doing so does not affect any other instances of this product or its cloud services.. sensitive product-specific data, such as private keys, domains, or API endpoints, have been obfuscated or redacted.For owners of ESP32-based IoT devices:  Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.

&gt; Creating an open-source project to de-cloud and debug smart home products; I've learned much more about the technical aspects.. I put a massive amount of effort into creating [this post].. probably more than.. the project itself. It would be amazing to receive feedback on the format!blog author: https://x.com/jmswrnr&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43688658</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best part I think is "pg_query is special. It doesn’t actually implement parsing SQL. It works by extracting C source code directly from Postgres and wraps it with a nice Rust interface. This allows PgDog to understand all queries that Postgres can."One of the things that puts metaprogramming on wheels is being able to pull in grammars, schemas and such for external systems.  Think how many cool tools we could have if we could do this in a more general way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;we need to ... understand SQL syntax using a parser, Rust ecosystem has a great library called pg_queryI'm impressed both that the Rust ecosystem had the right library available and that it was high enough quality code for the author's team to use it as a reference for building their own additional functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having written several pg txn poolers, I like the implementation. I also love your simple branding and I think this could make a fantastic product for enterprise customers. However, my biggest concern as a buyer is longevity. PgCat (another popular pooler in rust) will likely lose funding shortly. Meanwhile, PgBouncer is battle tested, small in scope, and is starting to get consistent new contribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43693326</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been using this for https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography and am very happy, thanks for building this.Automated review tools like this are especially important for an open source project because you have to maintain a quality bar to keep yourself sane but if you're too picky then no one from the community will want to contribute. AI tools are like linters and have no feelings, so they will give the feedback that you as a reviewer may have been hesitant to give, and that's awesome.Oh, and on the product itself, I think it's super cool that it comes up with rules on its own to check for based on conventions and patterns that you've enforced over time. E.g. we use it to make sure that all function calls that pull from an upstream API are decorated with our standard error handler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an awesome direction. Few thoughts:It would be awesome if the custom rules were generalized on the fly from ongoing reviewer conversations. Imaging two devs quibble about line length in a PR, and in a future PR, the AI reminds about this convention.Would this work seamlessly with AI Engineers like Devin? I imagine so.This will be very handy for solo devs as well, even those who don't use Coding CoPilots could benefit from an AI reviewer, if it does not waste their time.Maybe there can be multiple AI models review the PR at the same time, and over time, we promote the ones whose feedback is accepted more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a few of these already. Is this a land grab play, i.e. with investment get the big accounts then all the compliance ticks then dominate?AI or conventional bots for PRs are neat though. Where I work we have loads of them checking all sorts of criteria. Most are rules based. E.g. someone from this list must review if this folder changes. Kinda annoying when getting the PR in but overall great for quality control. We are using an LLM AI for commenting on potential issues too. (Sorry I don't have any influence to help them to consider yours)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43692476</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was young I used to make a lot of levels for Tomb Raider (3? 4?) because I found the process of making sacred-but-spooky feeling places very enchanting. I had no one to share them with, so it was more like just making folk art for myself and my brother. This feeling was not surpassed until Minecraft came out (and then that was not surpassed until I bought land).The levels are fundamentally comprised of square blocks that you push up from the ground, and maybe tilt one of the four sides to make shapes. To make caves and rooms, there is a second set of blocks that you pull down from the ceiling!To get an idea of what this feels like, see this particular tutorial video of theirs: https://tombengine.com/docs/extended-geometry-update-1-7/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The homepage says "The open-source engine" but I can't find a link to the source code anywhere on the site. The link that says "Download" is a link to some Windows binary.Edit: https://github.com/TombEngine/TombEngine that seems to be the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more interesting: https://github.com/MontyTRC89/Tomb-Editor (the level editor that goes with the engine)What made the eternal life of Quake has been its open source level editor which means designers can have a field day making new levels.The editor is as important as the engine, if not more.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical factors that contributed to the United States becoming a leader in science and technology. It highlights key events such as World War II, the Cold War, and significant government investments in research and education, particularly through initiatives like the GI Bill and funding for universities.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth reading in its entirety. The following four paragraphs, about post-WWII funding of science in Britain versus the US, are spot-on, in my view:&gt; Britain’s focused, centralized model using government research labs was created in a struggle for short-term survival. They achieved brilliant breakthroughs but lacked the scale, integration and capital needed to dominate in the post-war world.&gt; The U.S. built a decentralized, collaborative ecosystem, one that tightly integrated massive government funding of universities for research and prototypes while private industry built the solutions in volume.&gt; A key component of this U.S. research ecosystem was the genius of the indirect cost reimbursement system. Not only did the U.S. fund researchers in universities by paying the cost of their salaries, the U.S. gave universities money for the researchers facilities and administration. This was the secret sauce that allowed U.S. universities to build world-class labs for cutting-edge research that were the envy of the world. Scientists flocked to the U.S. causing other countries to complain of a “brain drain.”&gt; Today, U.S. universities license 3,000 patents, 3,200 copyrights and 1,600 other licenses to technology startups and existing companies. Collectively, they spin out over 1,100 science-based startups each year, which lead to countless products and tens of thousands of new jobs. This university/government ecosystem became the blueprint for modern innovation ecosystems for other countries.The author's most important point is at the very end of the OP:&gt; In 2025, with the abandonment of U.S. government support for university research, the long run of U.S. dominance in science may be over.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a couple fundamental flaws here:One is that the number one Science and Engineering powerhouse prior to WWII was Germany, not Britain.Two this totally neglects that the US received the lion's share of Scientists and Mathematicians from countries like Germany, Hungary, Poland etc with the encroachment of the Soviets and persecution of the Jewish people.While the down up approach of the US and heavy funding probably helped a lot. Bringing in the Von Neumanns and Erdos of the world couldn't have hurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being the sole western industrialized nation that hadn't just had most of their infrastructure bombed to rubble can't have hurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43692360</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It strikes me as too bad that this API is so imperative. You can see a pattern over and over in the README where they have `do` blocks, in which they clear some global state (`initialize-prolog`), then add some assertions back into that global state (via side-effectful API calls), and finally run a query (which is implicitly a query on the state that's been built up). Why not represent the knowledge base as a normal Clojure data structure, rather than as the effect of a sequence of API calls? Then it can be passed in by the caller alongside the query, instead of being stored as mutable state.This isn't just a style thing, either; there are consequences. REPL-driven development loses a lot of its slickness when some expressions can only be eval'd in a special context.Also, what am I supposed to do if two different parts of my program want to use Clolog? If I'm using Clolog, and one of my dependencies is using it too, will we end up trashing each other's global state? (The case of external dependencies is just an example. Let's say I have an application that sets up the Clolog state and runs a query. Part of the setup involves calls to other parts of my application. At the time the code was written, those other parts didn't use Clolog, but now they do, and there's a bug, because those other parts are trashing the Clolog state that their caller had set up, before it runs its query.) Of course, you could get around this by adding something like a dynamically bound variable that points to the instance of state to use, but at that point you're jumping through hoops to support a subpar (stateful) paradigm that Clojure developers expect to be free of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;really happy to see something of a revival of interest for logic programming lately. it's an extremely powerful tool if you know when to reach for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I just cloned the repository, will play with it later.BTW, Clojure was such a brilliant name (from Rich): Whenever I see a project starting with "Clo" I pay attention.EDIT: had a chance to try it: a very cool resource!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695620</guid></item><item><title>18.

When I ask the same model a question in Turkish, the answer is mediocre. When I ask the model to translate my question into English, get the answer, and translate the answer back to Turkish, the model again does well.For example, I tried the above with Llama 3.3 70B, and asked it to plan me a 3-day trip to Istanbul. When I asked Llama to do the translations between English &lt;&gt; Turkish, the answer was notably better.Anyone else observed a similar behavior?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe someone should edit the title to mention this is from 2024: [Submitted on 30 Sep 2024 (v1), last revised 15 Oct 2024 (this version, v2)]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also quite liked the EuroLLM project: https://huggingface.co/blog/eurollm-team/eurollm-9bWas pretty good with Latvian (better than other models this size as well as variants of Llama or Qwen that I could run) and I assume probably with other EU languages as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43690955</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who are these customers that get developer support from Microsoft engineering teams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh I've debugged this before. Native memory allocator had a scavenge function which suspended all other threads. Managed language runtime had a stop the world phase which suspended all mutator threads. They ran at about the same time and ended up suspending each other. To fix this you need to enforce some sort of hierarchy or mutual exclusion for suspension requests.&gt; Why you should never suspend a thread in your own process.This sounds like a good general princple but suspending threads in your own process is kind of necessary for e.g. many GC algorithms. Now imagine multiple of those runtimes running in the same process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I knew from seeing a title like that on microsoft.com that it was going to be a Raymond Chen post! He writes fascinating stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695723</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of the reason bit torrent works really well is that the file is downloaded in random order. It lets everyone cooperate, while still being robust to bad peers, bad network connections, churn etc.If you want live high quality streaming, a lot of reasons bit torrent works so well goes away.Latency matters. In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes.In bit torrent, everyone can divide the work - clients try to download the part of the file the least number of people have, quickly rare parts of the file spread everywhere. In streaming everyone needs the same piece at the same time.Bit torrent punishes people who dont contribute by deprioritizing sending stuff to peers that freeride. It can do this on the individual level. In a p2p streaming setup, you probably have some peers getting the feed, and then sending it to other peers. The relationship isnt reciperocal so its harder to punish freeriders as you can't at the local level know if the peer you are sending data to is pushing data to the other nodes it is supposed to or not.I'm sure some of these have work arounds, but they are hard problems that aren't really satisfactorily solved&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a while, I was CTO of a company called Livestation [0], which as the Wikipedia article states, was "originally based on peer-to-peer technology acquired from Microsoft Research".This P2P stack was meant to allow for mass scaling of lowish latency video streaming, even in parts of the World with limited peer bandwidth to original content source servers. The VC-1 format got into a legal quagmire, as most video streaming protocols do, and it speaks volumes that by the time I turned up in ~2012-ish, the entire stack was RTMP, RTSP, HDS and HLS with zero evidence of that P2P tech stack in production.My main role was to get the ingest stack out of a DC and into cloud, while also dealing with a myriad of poor design decisions that led to issues (yes, that 2013 outage in the first paragraph of the wiki article was on my watch).At no point did anybody suggest to me that what we really needed to fix our attention back to was P2P streaming, beyond the fact the company built a version of Periscope (Twitter's first live streaming product), and launched it weeks/months before they did, and were pivoting towards a social media platform, at which point I decided to go do other things.The technical and legal problems are real, and covered elsewhere here. People want reliable delivery. Even Spotify, YouTube and others who have licensed content and could save a pile by moving to DRM-ified P2P don't go near it, and that should tell you something about the challenges.I'd love more widespread adoption of P2P tech, but not convinced we'll ever see it in AV any time soon, unfortunately.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveStation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Splitcast Technology built this in 2012. The company folded (couldn't find revenue, and had founder struggles ) but as far as I remember the tech worked. It still needed a lot of seeding nodes, but a significant chunk of the bandwidth was provided by the "viewer peers".Key part of that tech was that it synchronized the playback between all peers. That was nice for stock market announcements and sport events for example.https://web.archive.org/web/20131208173255/http://splitcast....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5UYu9jeQbYhttps://www.crunchbase.com/organization/splitcast-technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43684286</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article "JSX Over the Wire" discusses the concept of sending JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React, from the server to the client instead of sending HTML. The author explains the technical advantages of this approach, including enhanced performance and improved developer experience through seamless integration and reduced client-side rendering. The piece explores practical implementations and considerations for adopting JSX over traditional HTML rendering techniques, emphasizing how this method can optimize React applications by leveraging server capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big challenge with the approach not touched on in the post is version skew. During a deploy you'll have some new clients talk to old servers and some old clients talk to new servers. The ViewModel is a minimal representation of the data and you can constrain it with backwards compatibility guarantees (ex. Protos or Thrift), while the UI component JSON and their associated JS must be compatible with the running client.Vercel fixes this for a fee:
https://vercel.com/docs/skew-protectionI do wonder how many people will use the new React features and then have short outages during deploys like the FOUC of the past. Even their Pro plan has only 12 hours of protection so if you leave a tab open for 24 hours and then click a button it might hit a server where the server components and functions are incompatible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really compelling article Dan, and I say that as a long time l advocate of "traditional" server side rendering like Rails of old.I think your checklist of characteristics frames things well. it reminds me of Remix's introduction to the libraryhttps://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/introduction
&gt; Building a plain HTML form and server-side handler in a back-end heavy web framework is just as easy to do as it is in Remix. But as soon as you want to cross over into an experience with animated validation messages, focus management, and pending UI, it requires a fundamental change in the code. Typically, people build an API route and then bring in a splash of client-side JavaScript to connect the two. With Remix, you simply add some code around the existing "server side view" without changing how it works fundamentallyit was this argument (and a lot of playing around with challengers like htmx and JSX like syntax for Python / Go) that has brought me round to the idea that RSCs or something similar might well be the way to go.Bit of a shame seeing how poor some of the engagement has been on here and Reddit though. I thought the structure and length of the article was justified and helpful. Concerning how many peoples' responses are quite clearly covered in TFA they didn't read...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article doesn't mention "event handlers" a single time. Even if you get past the client and server getting out of sync and addressing each component by a unique id that's stable between deploys (unless it's been updated), this article doesn't show how you might make any of these components interactive. You can't add an onClick on the server. The best I can figure, you pass these in with a context?Ultimately this really just smooshed around the interface without solving the problem it sets out to solve: it moves the formatting of the mail markup to the server, but you can't move all of it unless your content is entirely static (and if you're getting it from the server, SOMETHING has to be interactive).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43694681</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have huge respect for Cohere and this embedding model looks like it could be best-in-class, but I find it hard to commit to a proprietary embedding model that's only available via an API when there are such good open weight models available.I really like the approach Nomic take: their most recent models are available via their API or as open weights for non-commercial use only (unless you buy a license). They later relicense their older models under Apache 2.0 licenses.This gives me confidence that I can continue to use my calculated vectors in the future even if Nomic's model is no longer available because I can run the local one instead.Nomic Embed Vision 1.5 for example started out as CC-BY-NC-4.0 but was later relicensed to Apache 2.0: https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/nomic-embed-vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just started to look into multi-modal embedding models recently, and I was surprised how few options there are.For example, Google's model only supports 30 text tokens [1]!!This is definitely a welcome addition.Any pointers to similarly powerful embedding models? I'm looking specifically for text and images? I wish there'd be also one that could do audio and video, but I don't think that exists.[1] https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embedd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No downloadable open weights ?Looks like I'll stay on [bge-m3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43694546</guid></item><item><title>24.

Like they quote 30-40 seconds in the article to hook a cow up to a milker with a robot, but a human can do it in 3-4 seconds and with a rotary milker they can milk near 5,000 cows 3x a day like that . That said it does usually take 3 or 4 people to run a rotary milker, 1 for udder cleaning, 1-2 for attaching milkers, and 1 for post-milk sanitizing. But of course the people working there are generally the most desperate of society because they get shit and pissed on all day and stink even after bathing, so only costs around $10 an hour.Not saying im not hoping this all improves or that it is good as-is, but the reality is these robots are competing with bottom of the barrel wages from tweakers working at a breakneck pace with live and moving and variable animals so it isn't easy and still has a ways to go before most peoples milk production can be automated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These machines have been around for a while. There are at least nine companies selling them.[1] This started in Australia and New Zealand, which don't have much cheap labor.There's a competing approach - robotic rotary milking.[2] Rotary milkers (giant turntables with cows on them) have been around for decades, and are becoming more automated, down from four people to one.All this stuff works fine. So there's a huge milk glut.[1] https://roboticsbiz.com/top-9-best-robotic-milking-machines/[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxhE53G3CUM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43699188</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The website showcases "Resonate," a project by Alexandre François that focuses on creating unique auditory experiences through generative music and sound design. It highlights the intersection of technology and art, with an emphasis on how soundscapes can evoke emotions and influence mood. The project invites users to engage with immersive audio compositions that are generated in real time, promoting a deeper connection to the listening experience and exploring the potential of sound as a medium for expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can view this result as the convolution of the signal with an exponentially decaying sine and cosine.That is,  `y(t') = integral e^kt x(t' - t) dt`, 
with k complex and negative real part.If you discretize that using simple integration and t' = i dt, t = j dt you get    y_i = dt sum_j e^(k j dt) x_{i - j}
    y_{i+1} = dt sum_j e^(k j dt) x_{i+1 - j}
            = (dt e^(k dt) sum_j' e^(k j' dt) x_{i - j'}) + x_i 
            = dt e^(k dt) y_i + x_i

If we then scale this by some value, such that A y_i = z_i we can write this as    z_{i+1} = dt e^(k dt) z_i + A x_i

Here the `dt e^(k dt)` plays a similar role to (1-alpha) and A is similar to P alpha - the difference being that P changes over time, while A is constant.We can write `z_i = e^{w dt i} r_i` where w is the imaginary part of k   e^{w dt (i+1)} r_{i+1} = dt e^(k dt) e^{w dt i} r_i + A x_i
             r_{i+1} = dt e^((k - w) dt) r_i + e^{-w dt (i+1) } A x_i
                     = (1-alpha) r_i + p_i x_i

Where p_i = e^{-w dt (i+1) } A = e^{-w dt ) p_{i-1}
Which is exactly the result from the resonate web-page.The neat thing about recognising this as a convolution integral, is that we can use shaping other than exponential decay - we can implement a box filter using only two states, or a triangular filter (this is a bit trickier and takes more states). While they're tricky to derive, they tend to run really quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice!  I've used a homegrown CQT-based visualizer for a while for audio analysis.  It's far superior to the STFT-based view you get from e.g. Audacity, since it is multiresolution, which is a better match to how we actually experience sound.  I have for a while wanted to switch my tool to a gammatone-filter-based method [1] but I didn't know how to make it efficient.Actually I wonder if this technique can be adapted to use gammatone filters specifically, rather than simple bandpass filters.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammatone_filter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason the value of Pi given in the C++ code is wrong!It's given in the source as 3.14159274101257324219
when the right value to the same number of digits is
3.14159265358979323846. Very weird. I noticed when I went to look at the C++ to see how this algorithm was actually implemented.https://github.com/alexandrefrancois/noFFT/blob/main/src/Res... line 31.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43694157</guid></item><item><title>26.

We prove this alignment and further show that vision can be effectively learned by LLMs as a form of language.Does this really show much that https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03728#facebook (uncited) and other earlier work did not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hmm this is a tough name - conflicts with Liquid AI https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43697532</guid></item><item><title>27.

You could do this 20 years ago on a consumer laptop, and you don't need the information you get for free from text moving under a filter either.What you need is the ability to reproduce the conditions the image was generated and pixelated/blurred under. If the pixel radius only encompasses, say, 4 characters, then you only need to search for those 4 characters first. And then you can proceed to the next few characters represented under the next pixelated block.You can think of pixelation as a bad hash which is very easy to find a preimage for.No motion necessary. No AI necessary. No machine learning necessary.The hard part is recreating the environment though, and AI just means you can skip having that effort and know-how.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, that is pretty wild.I recall a co-worker doing something related(?) for a kind of fun tech demo some ten years or so ago. If I recall it was shooting video while passing a slightly ajar office door. His code reconstructed the full image of the office from the "traveling slit".I think about that all the time when I find myself in a public bathroom stall.... :-/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would seem techniques like this have been used in domains like astronomy for a while.&gt; The reconstruction of objects from blurry images has a wide range of applications, for instance in astronomy and biomedical imaging. Assuming that the blur is spatially invariant, image blur can be defined as a two-dimensional convolution between true image and a point spread function. Hence, the corresponding deblurring operation is formulated as an inverse problem called deconvolution. Often, not only the true image is unknown, but also the available information about the point spread function is insufficient resulting in an extremely underdetermined blind deconvolution problem. Considering multiple blurred images of the object to be reconstructed, leading to a multiframe blind deconvolution problem, reduces underdeterminedness. To further decrease the number of unknowns, we transfer the multiframe blind deconvolution problem to a compact version based upon [18] where only one point spread function has to be identified.https://www.mic.uni-luebeck.de/fileadmin/mic/publications/St...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_deconvolution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695701</guid></item><item><title>28.

It does make sense, people are typically not as involved in other domains and not exposed to those papers. But I do still find it surprising how different the practices can be overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of reminds me of the system we used in my band in the 90s: The person who brought the initial idea to the band gets to be first. After that, it was based on importance of contributions as determined by myself as the benign dictator, but if I contributed, my name always came last (unless I was the one who brought the idea to the band).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695285</guid></item><item><title>29. 7k-year-old skeletons from the green Sahara reveal a mysterious human lineage</title><link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/7000-year-old-skeletons-from-the-green-sahara-reveal-a-previously-unknown-human-lineage-180986403/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fascinating how genomic analysis continually reshapes our understanding of human migration patterns. This discovery highlights that human evolutionary history is far more complex than our traditional "out of Africa" models suggest, with multiple lineages coexisting and interbreeding throughout prehistoric North Africa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's interesting is that the population remained isolated for tens of thousands of years.Generally speaking, people move around and are promiscuous. Staying isolated for that long implies a physical barrier, because cultures generally don't survive for 40,000 years.  But an isolated population means genetic issues - but if the population is big then they should have spread at least somewhat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious how this post says '5 Hours ago' but if you search or click 'smithsonianmag.com' up there, you see this as a post that says 3 days ago?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43663713</guid></item><item><title>30.

Sounds like they could have solved it by asking the photographer first, which they eventually did:&gt; Finally, Spark contacted Murray Close, the photographer who took the picture of Jack Nicholson that was inserted into the original image.&gt; The photographer revealed that "there was no such thing as the Warner Brothers photo archive [and] that was a complete mistake."&gt; Instead, Close had sourced the original photo from the BBC Hulton Photo Library in London, now part of Getty Images.&gt; The photo, it turns out, was taken at a Valentine's Day dance on February 14, 1921, in the Empress Ballroom at the Royal Palace Hotel in London.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I do feel a sense of achievement. We knew the photograph with Jack Nicholson in [it]. We knew that there was an unknown man, but we didn't know who he was.Of course, this skips over the fact that it was actually a reddit poster who discovered the person, and the professor didn't believe him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non lite version:

It’s a book of moral lessons to be drawn from the chessmen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the fascinating things about middle English for modern readers is that spelling was somewhat arbitrary. I suppose the literacy rate so low back then that the community of people blessed with the skill of reading and writing got to make up their own rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I checked out the Alliterative Morte Arthure ( https://metseditions.org/read/KWj7bbRIl0RBUmG9uG60zTv8Wak97Z... ).I'm charmed by the Middle English footnoting style of providing glosses for words that may trouble the modern-English-speaking reader without bothering to note which words those glosses are for.However, this edition isn't typeset correctly, and the glosses are appearing attached to the wrong lines. (At least, I'm assuming that "great", glossing an empty line, is meant to gloss "grete" on the following line, and "shameful deeds", on the line "And the precious prayer / of his pris Moder" is actually meant to gloss the following line "Sheld us fro shamesdeede / and sinful workes".)†This is a pretty serious problem.More generally, these appear to be edited critical editions, and I wish academic texts would actually display the text of the work they represent. I don't mind displaying a standardized "editor's rendering", but show the actual text too. I want to know what the scribe wrote. This is an electronic reference. We can afford the space.† Tangentially, it's also interesting that "sinful" counts as alliterating with "shield" and "shame".--- edit ---Heh. I looked into the display. There are two different documents, text and glosses, and they're supposed to be synched up by matching &lt;br&gt; tags.This could actually work, because the panel for the text has a hardcoded width of 487 px regardless of window size. But they've blown it by including a sentence at the beginning of the text that is more than one line long - even though they know exactly how long a line is - and ignoring that in their emission of &lt;br&gt; tags. So every line of text is pushed down by one line, and the same isn't true of the glosses.The correct way to do this is to have the glosses in the same document as the text:    And the precious prayer  of his pris&lt;div class="gloss"&gt;excellent&lt;/div&gt; Moder

and then style the glosses to float to the right.Or if you need separate documents, you could have a table and put glosses in the same row as the line they're glossing. The text is already displayed in a table - but there's just one row, with one cell for line numbers, one for the text, and one for the glosses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43696544</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "target triples," which are strategies for targeting specific groups or demographics in marketing and outreach efforts. It outlines the importance of accurately identifying and analyzing target audiences to optimize communication and engagement. The piece emphasizes the need for data-driven decision-making and suggests methods for effectively reaching and resonating with these target groups. It serves as a guide for marketers to enhance their campaigns by focusing on clearly defined audience segments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are also many ficticious names for 64-bit x86, which you should avoid unless you want the younger generation to make fun of you. amd64 refers to AMD’s original implementation of long mode in their K8 microarchitecture, first shipped in their Athlon 64 product. Calling it amd64 is silly and also looks a lot like arm64, and I am honestly kinda annoyed at how much Go code I’ve seen with files named fast_arm64.s and fast_amd64.s. Debian also uses amd64/arm64, which makes browsing packages kind of annoying.I prefer amd64 as it's so much easier to type and scans so much easier. x86_64 is so awkward.Bikeshed I guess and in the abstract I can see how x86_64 is better, but pragmatism &gt; purity and you'll take my amd64 from my cold dead hands.As for Go, you can get the GOARCH/GOOS combinations from "go tool dist list". Can be useful at times if you want to ensure your code cross-compiles in CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some other sources of target triples (some mentioned in the article, some not):rustc: `rustc --print target-list`golang: `go tool dist list`zig: `zig targets`As the article point out, the complete lack of standardization and consistency in what constitutes a "triple" (sometimes actually a quad!) is kind of hellishly hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article but I was really put off by this bit, which aside from being very condescending, simply isn't true and reveals a lack of appreciation for the innovation that I would have thought someone posting about target triples and compilers would have appreciated:&gt; Why the Windows people invented a whole other ABI instead of making things clean and simple like Apple did with Rosetta on ARM MacBooks? I have no idea, but http://www.emulators.com/docs/abc_arm64ec_explained.htm contains various excuses, none of which I am impressed by. My read is that their compiler org was just worse at life than Apple’s, which is not surprising, since Apple does compilers better than anyone else in the business.I was already familiar with ARM64EC from reading about its development from Microsoft over the past years but had not come across the emulators.com link before - it's a stupendous (long) read and well worth the time if you are interested in lower-level shenanigans. The truth is that Microsoft's ARM64EC solution is a hundred times more brilliant and a thousand times better for backwards (and forwards) compatibility than Rosetta on macOS, which gave the user a far inferior experience than native code, executed (sometimes far) slower, prevented interop between legacy and modern code, left app devs having to do a full port to move to use newer tech (or even just have a UI that matched the rest of the system), and was always intended as a merely transitional bit of tech to last the few years it took for native x86 apps to be developed and take the place (usurp) of old ppc ones.Microsoft's solution has none of these drawbacks (except the noted lack of AVX support), doesn't require every app to be 2x or 3x as large as a sacrifice to the fat binaries hack, offers a much more elegant solution for developers to migrate their code (piecemeal or otherwise) to a new platform where they don't know if it will be worth their time/money to invest in a full rewrite, lets users use all the apps they love, and maintains Microsoft's very much well-earned legacy for backwards compatibility.When you run an app for Windows 2000 on Windows 11 (x86 or ARM), you don't see the old Windows 2000 aesthetic (and if you do, there's an easy way for users to opt into newer theming rather than requiring the developer to do something about it) and you aren't stuck with bugs from 30 years ago that were long since patched by the vendor many OS releases ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43696756</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential dangers of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into various sectors, particularly emphasizing the concept of an "AI poison pill." It highlights the risks of misaligned AI systems, where the technology could inadvertently cause harm if not properly managed or controlled. The author, Benn Jordan, also reflects on the ethical implications of AI development and calls for careful consideration and regulation to ensure that AI serves humanity positively rather than posing threats. The overall message advocates for responsible AI practices to prevent negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any new "defense" that claims to use adversarial perturbations to undermine GenAI training should have to explain why this paper does not apply to their technique: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12027The answer is, almost unfailingly, "this paper applies perfectly to our technique because we are just rehashing the same ideas on new modalities". If you believe it's unethical for GenAI models to train on people's music, isn't is also unethical to trick those people into posting their music online with a fake "defense" that won't actually protect them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like Benn Jordan because he’s clearly got a grasp on a functional understanding of machine learning, but that’s not his primary background. He comes from a music production background, so his focus is more practical and results-oriented.It will be really interesting as this knowledge percolates into more and more fields, what domain experts do with it. I see ML as more of a bag of tricks that can be applied to many fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Benn is one of my fave subscriptions on YouTube--both for the (now more occasional) music gear stuff and for the in-depth music industry education. The fact that he has been hacking away at IP and AI stuff for ages is just icing on the cake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695401</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see SDC concerns being taken more seriously by hardware folks. Once software gets to sufficient quality (which we have achieved in many cases), these kinds of rando hw issues are the only remaining causes of  "impossible" bugs that waste endless engineering time to debug.I wonder how much of this relies on or is made easier by the clustered core architecture of E-Core Xeons. In comparison each physical core of P-Core Xeons is its own island basically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this limited to lockstep between softcores on a die - so good for low level error failures like soft error, but no good if the package dies?
(Still very neatly done)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what is the ratio of software vs those type of hardware bugs in the wild. Maybe the product of this paper will help produce this metric.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695834</guid></item><item><title>39.

Author here if you have any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you considered making something more expensive with better performance? Commercially? You mention Keysight VNA's in the $10,000+ range, but we regularly buy VNA's in the $100,000+ range. I imagine with a $1000 budget you could do quite a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in RF circuits, I highly recommend taking a look at X-MWblocks prototyping framework by https://quanticxmw.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43696798</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article serves as a guide to Modern CMake, providing an introduction to the features and practices of CMake, a widely-used build system for C++ projects. It covers key concepts such as building from source, setting up a project structure, managing dependencies, and optimizing configuration for various platforms. The document emphasizes modern techniques and best practices that streamline the build process and enhance code organization, making it beneficial for developers looking to improve their CMake skills and project management in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

They even tell us how to structure the project with a src folder, but I still have to remember to add or remove source code files to the right CMakeLists.txt when the content of that folder changes. It's poor design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CMake gets a lot of hate because a lot of large projects use it poorly and the syntax is strange, but I've found it invaluable for projects I've worked on. The first page of this site has a great list of reasons why someone would want to use CMake. I would recommend at least reading that far rather than reading "CMake" in the title and reflexively commenting something negative. I skimmed through and this seems like a nice resource to get people spun up on CMake, I'll recommend it to new users in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even latest CMake version still has that terrible syntax. If they want to survive the competition, at some point they need to provide (an option at least) another, proper syntax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43694549</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of reshoring manufacturing to America, emphasizing that despite growing interest and policy support, the process is complex. It highlights issues such as the need for skilled labor, supply chain logistics, and maintaining competitiveness against countries with lower labor costs. The authors argue that while reshoring can enhance national security and create jobs, it requires significant investment in infrastructure, workforce training, and innovation to be truly successful. Overall, the piece underscores the importance of realistic expectations and strategic planning in the effort to revitalize American manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

Why?This appears to be completely wrong? All the stats I can find say that the US has about 4x the per capita electricity generation of China.Other than that it seems to be mostly good points, especially the overall one: you cannot do this overnight.&gt; If you’re building a new factory in the United States, your investment will alternate between maybe it will work, and catastrophic loss according to which way the tariffs and the wind blows. No one is building factories right now, and no one is renting them, because there is no certainty that any of these tariffs will lastPolicy by amphetamine-driven tweeting is a disaster.&gt; 12. Enforcement of the tariffs will be uneven and manipulatedYup. The 145% level seems designed to create smuggling, and the wild variations between countries to create re-labelling. It's chicken tax trucks all over again.&gt; This is probably the worst economic policy I’ve ever seenPer Simpsons: this is the worst economic policy you've seen so far. The budget is yet to come.&gt; If American companies want to sell in China, they must incorporate there, register capital, and name a person to be a legal representative. To sell in Europe, we must register for their tax system and nominate a legal representative. For Europeans and Chinese to sell in the United States, none of this is needed, nor do federal taxes need to be paid.This is .. not a bad idea, really. It would probably be annoying for small EU and UK exporters but less so than 10% tariffs and even less so than random day of the week tariffs. Maybe one day it could harmonise with the EU VAT system or something.(also I think the author is imagining that sub-par workers, crime, and drugs don't exist in China, when they almost certainly do, but somewhere out of sight. Possibly due to the internal migration control of hukou combined with media control?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other day I saw the results of a poll [1] where 80% of Americans thought the *country* would be better off if more Americans worked in factories. However, only 20% of Americans thought that *they* would be better off if more Americans worked in factories. It was surprisingly bipartisan.In other words, people like the idea of this, but no one actually wants this.[1] https://www.ft.com/content/845917ed-41a5-449f-946f-70263adba...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Blow's "Preventing the collapse of civilization" [1] makes a similar point. It is easy to assume that, if we can build EUV machines and space telescopes, then processing stainless steel and manufacturing PCBs is baby stuff, and is just waiting for the proper incentives to spring up again. Unfortunately that is not the case -- reality has a surprising amount of detail [2] and even medium-level technology takes know-how and skilled workers to execute properly. Both can be recovered and scaled back up if the will is there. And time -- ten or twenty years of persistent and intelligent effort should be plenty to MAGA :)1. https://www.youtube.com/embed/pW-SOdj4Kkk2. http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43692677</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "vibe coding," which refers to the trend of making coding decisions based more on personal intuition and aesthetics rather than solid technical principles and concrete data. The author critiques this approach, arguing that while it may foster creativity and a relaxed work environment, it can ultimately lead to poorly structured code and unreliable systems. Emphasizing the importance of a balanced methodology, the author calls for a return to rigorous coding practices and data-driven decision-making to ensure quality and maintainability in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the genuinely positive things about tools like Copilot and ChatGPT is that they empower people with minimal development experience to create their own programs. Little programs that do useful things - and that’s awesome. More power to the users.I've changed my outlook on vibe coding after seeing the results of this wholesome vibe coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pJUXocn7aE .This guy didn't just make a small program, he made a product that is attuned to some very stringent requirements. If you gave this project to experienced software developers it would be heavy on process and light on impact, take forever to make, and stupid expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;they empower people with minimal development experience to create their own programs.The author goes out of their way to play up the toy aspect of the LLMs when driven by the inexperienced.  No mention is made of them being used by experienced developers, but I get the impression he feels they aren't useful to the experienced.I'm just playing with a small client/server tool (rsync but for block devices), and vibe coding allowed me to figure out some rough edges of my design document, and experiment with "what would it look like built with threads?  As async code?  As procedural?)  I would never have done that before because of the sheer amount of time it would take, I'd have picked what I thought was best and then lived with the sunk cost falacy until I had no other choice.  It did a pretty good job of catching reasonable exceptions in the communication code which I probably would have just let throw a traceback until I got a bug report.  It did a great job of adding logging and debugging options.  And I had it take 4 attempts at making a "fancy" --progress display and picked the one I liked the best.LLMs give a level of exploration to software development that we haven't seen since the good old days when HP set up several groups to each build their next generation workstation environment, and then picked the best one.IMHO, the experienced software developers stand at a unique position to take advantage of these LLMs that far outstrip what an inexperienced developer can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I want to cook a home meal.If I wanted to open a large world class fast food chain, I wouldn't be cooking home meals then. That would be silly.Copilot can help me cook the equivalent of a McDonalds special in terms of software. It's good, I think McDonalds is delicious.But it cannot help me cook a home meal software. It will insist that my home made fries must go in a little red box, and my fish sandwich needs only half a slice of cheese.Deeply into that metaphor, maybe someone who has only worked for fast food chains might forget that a lot of good industrial dishes are variations of what previously were home cooked meals.I am glad that copilot can help young cooks to become fast food workers. That really looks like something.Well, I take pleasure in cooking home meal software. Can you make a copilot that helps with that?You know what, nevermind. I don't need a copilot to cook home meals. I have a bunch of really good old books and I trust my taste.It's not like some big company is going to be interested in some random amateur dish, is it? It was definitely not cooked for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43687767</guid></item><item><title>43.

I picked one up off Amazon, along with a small selection of aftermarket metal and nylon-weave bands. It's been years since I bothered wearing any kind of bracelet, and the fetish for expensive watches as conspicuous display of debt-financed pretense of wealth passed me by, but a bracelet topped with a cute little OLED touchscreen, bristling with sensors, and powered by what appears to be an extremely open and friendly programming environment? That's worth the trouble of reaccustoming myself to a somewhat unfashionable accessory.(Make sure there isn't a space in the simulator executable's pathname. Also note that, because the Band 7 runs Zepp OS 1.0, you won't be able to use any feature that's documented as requiring an API_LEVEL, i.e. OS 2.0 or higher. That's probably part of why these are so cheap, but if they're as flexible as I get the sense from these docs they may be, I'll be upgrading pretty soon to something much more capable like a T-Rex 3.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential drawbacks of hosting open-source projects on GitHub. It argues that reliance on a proprietary platform can hinder the very ethos of open-source software by limiting accessibility, transparency, and community involvement. The author emphasizes the importance of using decentralized alternatives that align more closely with open-source principles and encourages developers to consider hosting projects on platforms that prioritize user control and encourage collaborative environments. The piece also highlights specific open-source alternatives to GitHub, advocating for a shift towards more community-driven solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't believe there's any major harm in using Github for most projects.Maintaining my own servers and chasing ideological purity doesn't improve my project. Any time I dedicate to setting up infrastructure is time I'm not dedicating to making the code better.The nature of Git means Microsoft can't really do much harm. Every developer and contributor has a copy of the repo, should the worst happen setting up home elsewhere isn't that difficult. But until it is, why spend time on it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the reasons mentioned in the article are to be taken seriously (unlike some of the other commenters here). Historically, Microsoft has shown itself as "not an ally to Open Source" to put it mildly. And there is a real tie-in to Github-the-platform (issues, workflows, etc) despite the fact that git repos themselves can be migrated away trivially (by design).Having said that, the alternatives they mention aren't realistic. Precisely those things that make GitHub dangerous, are the things that make it worth choosing. In particular: network effects, issue tracking and PRs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason I don't use Github is Microsoft's hatred stance on open source.Anyone remember Microsoft calling Linux a "cancer"? Or Microsoft threatening open source developers for violating 200 patents? Or their official stand where they whould threaten and fear Linux devs? The secretly funded lawsuits against Linux? They even threatened lawsuits at companies for just using Linux.This company is rotten by the executive level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43688417</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of a random number generator (RNG) using cosine functions in a Nix programming environment. It explores the principles behind the RNG, highlights the advantages of using cosine for randomness, and provides technical details on how to effectively code this generator within Nix. Additionally, it touches on practical applications and the importance of randomness in computational tasks, making a case for the effectiveness of this method in various scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice!  I worked on something similar as an undergrad project years ago, setting up beams with different orbital angular momentum characteristics.  Was a lot fun working in the lab.   Sadly I didn’t have the focus/grit to finish writing a paper (sorry Dr. Singh).  Side note, this was in 2007 and the folks in our optics lab would check the location of beams by grabbing from the stacks of ancient punchcards lying around and waving them next to the apparatus.This paper has a pretty similar setup, but adds a spatial light modulator (like a DLP projector that can control phase as well as brightness).What is wild to me is that the researchers here are able to create a beam where the angular moment changes as you move away.Plus the really cool spiral patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't extract meaning past the third or fourth line, but just as an idle curiosity: isn't a vortex the product of interaction between the particles? Are photons interacting with each other?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't speak on the subject, but I just want to say I really enjoyed the Star-Trek-esque language (:  Here, we introduce optical rotatum, a behavior of light in which
  an optical vortex beam experiences a quadratic chirp in its orbital
  angular momentum along the optical path. We show that such an adiabatic
  deformation of topology is associated with the accumulation of a Gouy
  phase factor, which, in turn, perturbs the propagation constant (spatial
  frequency) of the beam.

"Captain, if we can't reduce the adiabadic deformation of the Gouy phase factor, we'll never escape this optical vortex beam!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43666083</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impending termination of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program due to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) failure to renew its contract with the program's managing organization, MITRE Corporation. This lapse raises concerns over the tracking and management of security flaws, potentially leading to increased risks for organizations relying on the CVE database for identifying vulnerabilities. The article highlights the critical role the CVE program plays in cybersecurity and the implications of its discontinuation, stressing the need for urgent action to ensure continuity in vulnerability management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Darwin's Children," a collaborative project that features creative interpretations of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" through illustrations. It highlights how various artists have depicted Darwin's theories using imaginative and playful imagery, such as battles among vegetables, to engage a wider audience with his scientific ideas. The project aims to blend art and science, promoting creativity while exploring evolutionary concepts, ultimately making Darwin's work more accessible and entertaining for people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant only by virtue of also being about historical children’s drawings, but it reminds of another example of a child’s drawings preserved for us to see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfim&gt; … Onfim, was a boy who lived in Novgorod (now Veliky Novgorod, Russia) in the 13th century, some time around 1220 or 1260. He left his notes and homework exercises scratched in soft birch bark, which was preserved in the clay soil of Novgorod.I would wager that if you could travel back in time to the emergence of anatomically modern humans, you’d find they’re just like us. I don’t think that’s particularly controversial or surprising, but it’s easy to forget that people who came long before us were really no different from us (or put differently, were no different than them), and it helps to better understand history if you think of them that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite Darwin fun fact is his detailed pros and cons list on whether to get married.https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/14/darwin-list-pros-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the few things children still do even centuries later. In many aspects, we have changed so drastically that I think 100-year-ago people would find us weird and unsociable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43706037</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok, I’m a bit underwhelmed. I’ve asked it a fairly technical question, about a very niche topic (Final Fantasy VII reverse engineering): https://chatgpt.com/share/68001766-92c8-8004-908f-fb185b7549...With right knowledge and web searches one can answer this question in a matter of minutes at most. The model fumbled around modding forums and other sites and did manage to find some good information but then started to hallucinate some details and used them in the further research. The end result it gave me was incorrect, and the steps it described to get the value were totally fabricated.What’s even worse in the thinking trace it looks like it is aware it does not have an answer and that the 399 is just an estimate. But in the answer itself it confidently states it found the correct value.Essentially, it lied to me that it doesn’t really know and provided me with an estimate without telling me.Now, I’m perfectly aware that this is a very niche topic, but at this point I expect the AI to either find me a good answer or tell me it couldn’t do it. Not to lie me in the face.Edit: Turns out it’s not just me: https://x.com/transluceai/status/1912552046269771985?s=46&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting... I asked o3 for help writing a flake so I could install the latest Webstorm on NixOS (since the one in the package repo is several months old), and it looks like it actually spun up a NixOS VM, downloaded the Webstorm package, wrote the Flake, calculated the SHA hash that NixOS needs, and wrote a test suite. The test suite indicates that it even did GUI testing- not sure whether that is a hallucination or not though. Nevertheless, it one-shotted the installation instructions for me, and I don't see how it could have calculated the package hash without downloading, so I think this indicates some very interesting new capabilities. Highly impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very impressive! But under arguably the most important benchmark -- SWE-bench verified for real-world coding tasks -- Claude 3.7 still remains the champion.[1]Incredible how resilient Claude models have been for best-in-coding class.[1] But by only about 1%, and inclusive of Claude's "custom scaffold" augmentation (which in practice I assume almost no one uses?). The new OpenAI models might still be effectively best in class now (or likely beating Claude with similar augmentation?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43707719</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone teaching their 4 year old to read right now, I don't buy it. The text is long on "friendly" and random stuff like that, but that's not what I'm looking for in a font for kids.Just off the top of my head the "v" in there doesn't have a point on the bottom, which is one of the confusions my daughter has ("u" vs "v"). And I don't think the "n" needs the serif on the right foot, as that's not the "platonic" shape of a lower case N. I do appreciate that their lower case "a" is more like a handwritten one, as is the lower case "g".I've been going through the Teach Your Child to Read[0] book, and it introduces a "learner-friendly" font, which actually helps. It has special glyphs for "th", for example, and other font tricks like making silent letters smaller, and different variants for the vowels depending on their sound. Eventually, those tricks are minimized and the kid is reading a normal font, though.In other words, I'm interested in the idea of a font that's useful for early readers, but this font doesn't seem to be concretely designed in that way, and I'm put off by the vague "friendly" type stuff it seems to be focusing on.[0] https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; unpublished study is finding that adding prosody to text improves children’s comprehension.As a dyslexic software engineer who knows by heart a good number of the 50 tables in the open font type specification, I'd like to look into this in more detail but there is no code or paper published about this (yet).In the mean time, it would be nice for people stop using dyslexics as an excuse to motivate for their own special interests. I've suffered my entire formative years under this low-key Munchausen by proxy from all sort of educators gass-lighting me into believing I should use some technology that in the fullness of time proved to be counter productive.But ok, the variable speed HOI animation looks cool, I'll give you that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone remember Microsoft's McZee font from Creative Writer/Fine Artist?https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/mczeeThis was my go-to many years ago!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43704904</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Nintendo's strategic decisions in the 1980s led to the decline of Atari in the gaming industry. It outlines the contrasting business models of the two companies, highlighting Nintendo's focus on high-quality games and strict licensing policies that ensured better game performance and consumer satisfaction. The piece details how Nintendo's approach not only revitalized the video game market but also set new industry standards, ultimately leading to Atari's failure to adapt and compete effectively. Through this analysis, it examines broader themes of innovation, competition, and market dynamics in the gaming sector.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article ignores the fact that aside from being barred with manufacturing unlicensed NES games, Atari also failed to compete with any of its subsequent consoles after the VCS (although it did have some success with its PCs). The consoles were all flawed in some way. They were underpowered, didn't offer much over the previous iteration, or simply didn't have a strong enough library of games to compete. Atari was famously slow to realize that maybe people want more out of a game console than home ports of decade-old arcade games. On top of that, their original games that weren't home ports were mostly lackluster or were just outside of what gamers of the time were demanding.Hard to say that Nintendo putting the kibosh on one arm of Atari's business "bled them to death" when all their other arms were bleeding from self-inflicted wounds.EDIT: As pointed out below, I have mixed up Atari Corporation and Atari Games, so not all my criticism stands. Atari Games, publishing as Tengen, still largely put out ports of arcade games, but they were at least contemporary arcade games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The coda to this fascinating saga is that today - in a post publisher, open distribution marketplace - STEAM, the predominate game distribution gateway, allows anyone to publish just about anything for a $100 deposit and a 30% commission per sale.  The predictable end result is that 19,000 new games were uploaded to STEAM last year alone, and over 100,000 titles are available for purchase on the platform.The predictable result is that unless a studio has a lottery-win statistically equivalent outlier or a $50m marketing budget, a new game is swallowed up by the shear volume of titles.  1 in 5 games on STEAM never even earn back the $100 deposit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone reading the description of the NES's copy protection scheme in this article and thinking, "that doesn't sound right," you would be correct.The somewhat oversimplified version of how it works is that the console and the cartridge having matching microcrontrollers that output the same bitstream given the same seed. The system compares these and if at any point they differ, the system resets once per second.As you might guess, this is not a huge technical hurdle to overcome (although it was somewhat more difficult to reverse engineer in the 80's than today), but it was a pretty strong legal hurdle: Nintendo both patented the mechanism _and_ copyrighted the source code for this scheme, giving them (at least) two legal avenues to go after third-party game distributors who tried to work around it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43704596</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a man who decided to build his own Internet service provider (ISP) instead of paying a $50,000 fee to Comcast for service installation. He successfully established the ISP, delivering high-speed internet to his local community, and has since expanded the service to hundreds of homes. This initiative highlights the challenges and alternatives to traditional internet service providers, showcasing grassroots efforts to improve connectivity in areas often underserved by major companies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! I did this too - CenturyLink wanted an insane amount of money to bring fiber to our place, now we service hundreds and we're growing into a major contender in Boulder County - https://ayva.network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sonic started as a little local ISP in Santa Rosa, CA.[1] Now it's huge in Northern California.I have 1GB Sonic bidirectional fiber with unlimited data and could get 10GB if I wanted. The head of Sonic points out that long-haul prices have decreased over the years, and there's no real need for usage limits.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_(ISP)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read about “future proofing” and “expansion” possibilities of one’s fiber connection. And related user equipment.My story is in the opposite direction.We and everyone else in the neighborhood had symmetrical 1 Gbps installed about 15 years ago. We all paid the ISP for the top tier of full capacity.During Covid decided to take inventory of our actual bandwidth needs.Anything that can be deferred doesn’t count. Gone from instant bandwidth requirements are all cloud backups, OTA OS upgrades and apps updates. They need to complete overnight. Overlapping is not a requirement.Videos are automatically played at 480p or less on iPhones, 720p or less on iPads and 1080p or less on HDTV. We purposely didn’t buy 4K TV because at our viewing distance has no benefits whatsoever. Aggregate peak bandwidth required here is 25 Mbps at a stretch. That is also enough for my wife to work from home.We don’t deal with large datasets or raw videos over the internet.So we found ourselves with one cable connected TV and the usual assortment of mobile devices connected to one WiFi 4 1x1 hotspot. At 70 Mbps we never noticed any loss of quality in our digital lifestyle.After about ten years we replaced the hotspot with one capable of WiFi 5. An overkill but needed the extra port.Eventually convinced the ISP to lower our subscription to the lowest available tier of 200 Mbps. We don’t notice any difference. We could afford the extra bandwidth. But don’t see the benefits of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43709770</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The page on GitHub provides detailed information about OpenAI Codex, an advanced AI system designed to understand and generate code in various programming languages. Codex powers tools like GitHub Copilot, assisting developers by suggesting code snippets and functions as they work. The documentation covers the model's capabilities, how to access it via an API, and the various applications it supports, including automating repetitive coding tasks and aiding in software development. Additionally, the resource includes guidelines for usage, potential limitations, and ethical considerations related to AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;

It hallucinated a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the code, and completely misrepresented the architecture - it started talking about server backends and REST APIs in an app that doesn't have any of that.I'm curious what went so wrong - feels like possibly an issue with loading in the right context and attending to it correctly? That seems like an area that Claude Code has really optimized for.I have high hopes for o3 and o4-mini as models so I hope that other tests show better results! Also curious to see how Cursor etc. incorporate o3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure why they used React for a CLI. The code in the repo feels like it was written by an LLM—too many inline comments. Interestingly, their agent's system prompt mentions removing inline comments https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/src/util....&gt; - Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using \`git diff\`. Inline comments must be generally avoided, unless active maintainers of the repo, after long careful study of the code and the issue, will still misinterpret the code without the comments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, OpenAI’s Codex CLI is Claude Code, but worse?Cursor-Agent-Tools &gt; Claude Code &gt; Codex CLIhttps://pypi.org/project/cursor-agent-tools/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43708025</guid></item><item><title>8.

To mix two RGB colors, for example, we’d mix the red, green, and blue channels.Colorspace alert! mix != lerp in sRGB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool, but by css-rotating (skewY(-6deg)) the canvas at the last moment, you introduced aliasing on the border between the canvas and the rest of the page which kills the vibe. The browser can't automatically blend the canvas with the rest of the page. It's noticeable even on a brand new retina display. Maybe you could keep your canvas square and introduce the skew in the shader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This effect kinda reminds me of the PSP menu background&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43663290</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses OpenAI's exploration of creating a social network designed to compete with existing platforms like X (formerly Twitter). It highlights OpenAI's mission to utilize artificial intelligence to enhance social interactions and improve user experiences. The piece examines the potential implications of an AI-driven social network, including positive outcomes like better content moderation and user safety, as well as concerns regarding privacy and the spread of misinformation. The article ultimately raises questions about the feasibility and ethical considerations of such a platform within the current social media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CVE Foundation focuses on improving the cybersecurity of global systems by promoting the use of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which serves as a standardized method for identifying and cataloging security vulnerabilities. The foundation collaborates with various organizations to support the identification, analysis, and dissemination of information about vulnerabilities, ultimately aiming to enhance the security posture of software and systems worldwide. They also provide resources, guidance, and tools to assist different stakeholders, including security professionals and developers, in understanding and utilizing the CVE framework effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

Hence your example:    "question -&gt; answer: float"

Is very attractive here. Of course, some questions in my case would be quite abstract, but anyway. Also, multistage pipelines are also very interesting.[1]: loose set of bulletpoints brainstorming the idea if curious, not organised: https://kfs.mkj.lt/#audiovisllm (click to expand description)[2]: https://vvvv.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am wondering how libraries like DSPY [0] fits in your factor-2 [1]As I was reading, I saw mention of BAML
&gt; (the above example uses BAML to generate the prompt ...Personally, in my experience hand-writing prompts for extracting structured information from unstructured data has never been easy. With DSPY, my experience has been quite good so far.As you have used raw prompt from BAML, what do you think of using the raw prompts from DSPY [2]?[0] https://dspy.ai/[1] https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/con...[2] https://dspy.ai/tutorials/observability/#using-inspect_histo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very informative wiki, thank you, I will definitely use it. So Ive made my own "AI Agents framework" [0] based on actor model, state machines and aspect oriented programming (released just yesterday, no HN post yet) and I really like points 5 and 7:    5: Unify execution state and business state
    8. Own your control flow

That is exactly what SecAI does, as it's a graph control flow library at it's core (multigraph instead of DAG) and LLM calls are embedded into graph's nodes. The flow is reinforced with negotiation, cancellation and stateful relations, which make it more "organic". Another thing often missed by other frameworks are dedicated devtools (dbg, repl, svg) - programming for failure, inspecting every step in detail, automatic data exporters (metrics, traces, logs, sql), and dead-simple integrations (bash). I've released the first tech demo [1] which showcases all the devtools using a reference implementation of deepresearch (ported from AtomicAgents). You may especially like the Send/Stop button, which is nothings else then "Factor 6. Launch/Pause/Resume with simple APIs". Oh and it's network transparent, so it can scale.Feel free to reach out.[0] https://github.com/pancsta/secai[1] https://youtu.be/0VJzO1S-gV0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43699271</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As it has been mentioned before, MCP isn't "vulnerable". It's just on the other side of your air lock. Think of your MCP as a different client application. The whole thing is just a client. The fact that you need to write a client for your client is.... something, but your MCP app is a client app. It's boundaries with your service should be understood as such.Saying MCP is vulnerable is like saying "Web applications are vulnerable. Anyone can see the API calls you're making and modify them or trick your UI app to make a different call and hack your system". Obviously that's mostly nonsense, but not 100% wrong either. You see it a lot with very very inexperienced developers who think "just because my App is Android/iOS only I don't need to worry about authn/authz". There was just a story on here few weeks ago about some New Zealand startup that did that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding at play here.The MCP spec makes it pretty clear that MCP servers are expected to be run in environments that are implicitly trusted/trustable for any client that can reach them. This is clear from the default/assumed stdio transport, but even with SSE the protocol expects auth to be already-solved.In short, MCP servers are not meant to be accessible as public APIs -- as ChatGPT puts it, MCP assumes that its transport is inherently trusted. It doesn't seem like this is widely understood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Original author of some of the initial security notes at Invariant Labs here. Some resources, if you want to learn about MCP security:* Initial Security Note describing Tool Poisoning, Rug Pulls, Tool Shadowing for the first time with diagrams and detailed experiments: https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool...,* Attack on WhatsApp MCP (both tool poisoning but also take-over via an infected message to your account): https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/whatsapp-mcp-exploited* BrowserMCP attack, where it suffices for the agent to visit a compromised website (https://access.invariantlabs.ai): https://x.com/lbeurerkellner/status/1912145060763742579We also recently released a security scanning tool to detect and prevent such attacks, including upcoming support for full proxying and local security scanning of tool calling payload and responses.Please have a look and provide feedback if you can: https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43707021</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Well, the first problem I had, in order to do something like that, was to find an archive with Hacker News comments. Luckily there was one with apparently everything posted on HN from the start to 2023, for a huge 10GB of total data.This is actually super easy. The data is available in BigQuery.[0] It's up to date, too. I tried the following query, and the latest comment was from yesterday.    SELECT 
      id,
      text,
      `by` AS username,
      FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(time)) AS timestamp
    FROM 
      `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`
    WHERE 
      type = 'comment'
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(time)) = 2025
    ORDER BY 
      time DESC
    LIMIT 
      100


https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It works for me. The accounts I used long time ago are there in high positions.
I guess that my style is very distinctive.But I also have seen some accounts that seem to be from other non-native English speakers. They may even have a Latin language as their native one (I just read some of their comments, and, at minimum, some of them seem to also be from the EU). So, I guess, that it is also grouping people by their native language other than English.So, maybe, it is grouping many accounts by the shared bias of different native-languages. Probably, we make the same type of mistakes while using English.My guess will be that native Indian or Chinese speakers accounts will also be grouped together, for the same reason. Even more so, as the language is more different to English and the bias probably stronger.It would be cool that Australians, British, Canadians tried the tool. My guess is that the probability of them finding alt-accounts is higher as the populations is smaller and the writing more distinctive than Americans.Thanks for sharing the projects. It is really interesting.Also, do not trust the comments too much. There is an incentive to lie as to not acknowledge alt-accounts if they were created to remain hidden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For visibility, here's the tool where you can enter your hn username:https://antirez.com/hnstyle?username=pg&amp;threshold=20&amp;action=...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705632</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm. I'm not an expert, but some of this seems definitely not to be accurate.  Some of the "Bullshit" turns out perhaps to be quite important.Take the statement:&gt; Markov Chain is essentially a fancy name for a random walk on a graphIs that really true? I definitely don't think so. To my understanding, a Markov process is a stochastic process that has the additional (aka "Markov") property that it is "memoryless". That is, to estimate the next state you only need to know the state now, not any of the history. It becomes a Markov chain if it is a discrete, rather than continuous process.There are lots of random walks on graphs that satisfy this definition.  Like say you have a graph and you just specify the end points and say "walk 5 nodes at random from this starting node, what is the expectation that you end up at a specific end node". This could be a Markov process. At any point to estimate the state you only need to know the state now.But lots of random walks on graphs do not have the Markov property. For example, say I did the exact same thing as the previous example, so I have a random graph and a start and target node and I say "Walk n nodes at random from the starting node. What's the expectation that at some point you visit the target node". Now I have introduced a dependency on the history and my process is no longer memoryless. It is a discrete stochastic process and it is a random walk on a graph but is not a Markov chain.An example of a Markov and non-Markov processes in real life is if I have a European option on a stock I only care about what the stock price is at the expiry date. But if I have a barrier option or my option has some knock-in/knock-out/autocallable features then it has a path dependence because I care about whether at any point in its trajectory the price hit the barrier level, not just the price at the end. So the price process for the barrier option is non-Markov.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to learn Bayesian econometrics mostly on my own[1]. Fortunately, Jeff Miller[2] created a series of fantastic YouTube videos to explain Markov Chain Monte Carlo in detail. Personally, I prefer to learn mathematical concepts with equations and develop the intuition on my own. If you have the same preference, you will find his videos really helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY[1] I am lucky to know people who are fantastic Bayesian modelers and they helped me polish my concepts.[2] https://jwmi.github.io/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2015) Popular in:2022 (233 points, 53 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=333324372016 (125 points, 20 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=125370432015 (114 points, 17 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9331808&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43700633</guid></item><item><title>15.

Zig has good integration and support for SIMD operations that's perfect for this kind of things. It's definitely doable. I did a proof of concept on using SIMD to operate on 32-byte chunk to parse identifiers a while back.https://github.com/williamw520/misc_zig/blob/main/identifier...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The talks that Niles gave at the Utah Zig meetups (linked in the repo) were great, just wished the AV setup was a little smoother. There seemed like there some really neat visualizations that Niles prepared that flopped. Either way, I recommend it. Inspired me to read a lot more machine code these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting project!I wonder if there's a way to make this set of techniques less brittle and more applicable to any language.

I've been wanting a web browser that can turn the "regular web" (as much as possible) into something more like an e-book that happens to have hyperlinks.Essentially, imagine Reader Mode, but all the time.But this is... something else? I tried scrolling to the bottom and as soon as I click on the scroll bar, I get a pop-up showing a bunch of gestures and can no longer scroll. Pressing the back button does nothing. Closing the tab asks me if I want to discard my unsaved changes?!So I'm guessing this is some CSS/JS to make a regular site _behave_ something like an e-reader? Which may be fine as far as it goes, I just don't think it's a good idea to hijack the scroll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this idea!I have been working on a way to turn your phone into a better reader device with  https://astropad.com/bookcase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In lieu of an e-ink monitor, I use a hotkey to toggle "Grayscale" filtering on my Mac.It's taking some of the addictiveness out of my screen viewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43690828</guid></item><item><title>18.

The author aims to introduce readers to the basic principles of stochastic calculus, making it accessible even to those with limited mathematical background, and emphasizes its significance in modeling real-world phenomena that involve random fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's are widespread styles of teaching "mathy" subjects that completely ignore mathematical rigor (which is fine).Often a way to do this (which I personally dislike, but it's also objectively "fine" teaching and can be done very well) relies on "manipulation of symbols" rather than "manipulation of mathematical objects". This is a bit like like learning programming in a language that has macros but no functions. Usually, this includes teaching a set of rules ("allowed manipulations") that allows proving a contradiction, the remedy being that you just don't, perhaps by relying on your "intuition" and knowledge of the problem domain (as opposed to just the math), which only comes with experience and isn't taught systematically.The style of teaching that I find just intolerable pretends to be doing formal math, keeps telling you that rigor is important, floods you with definitions and terms, and then just does the "macro style of math" anyway, while skipping rigorous theorem statements (let alone proofs) entirely. Unfortunately, I find this article comes pretty close to this style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently this is the key to unlocking vast riches through a career as a derivatives quant. I'm told it's a requirement even though you don't really use it on the job. A bit like how you need to rebalance a binary tree to be a web developer.Anyway now it's the key to unlocking vast riches through a career as an AI researcher too, seems like a good skill to have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took "Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance" from edX, which covered these topics, and found it really rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43703623</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Llama Community License, emphasizing that many users may inadvertently violate its terms due to misunderstandings about permitted use cases. It clarifies key aspects of the license, such as restrictions on commercial use, proper attribution, and the importance of engagement within the community. The author encourages users to familiarize themselves with the license to avoid unintentional breaches, promoting a respectful and compliant approach to participating in the Llama community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why I've always considered the weights-vs-source debate to be an enormous red herring that skips the far more important question: are the weights actually "Open" in the first place?If Llama released everything that the most zealous opponents of weights=source demand they release under the same license that they're currently offering the weights under, we'd still be left with something that falls cleanly into the category of Source Available. It's a generous Source Available, but removes many of the freedoms that are part of both the Open Source and Free Software Definitions.Fighting over weights vs source implicitly cedes the far more important ground in the battle over the soul of FOSS, and that will have ripple effects across the industry in ways that ceding weights=source never would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It gets even weirder with Llama 4: https://www.llama.com/llama4/use-policy/ [Update: Apparently this has been the case since 3.2!]&gt; With respect to any multimodal models included in Llama 4, the rights granted under Section 1(a) of the Llama 4 Community License Agreement are not being granted to you if you are an individual domiciled in, or a company with a principal place of business in, the European Union. This restriction does not apply to end users of a product or service that incorporates any such multimodal models.This is especially strange considering that Llama 3.2 also was multimodal, yet to my knowledge there was no such restriction.In any case, at least Huggingface seems to be collecting these details now – see for example https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Inst...Curious to see what Ollama will do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AFAIK it’s still an open question whether there is any copyright in model weights, for various reasons including the lack of human authorship. Which would mean that if you didn’t separately and explicitly agree to the license by clicking through something, there is no basis for the “by using this model” agreement.Of course you probably don’t have enough money to get a ruling on this question, just wanted to point out that (afaik) it is up for debate. Maybe you should just avoid clicking on license agreement buttons, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676254</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The page features the "Attention Kmart Shoppers" audio track, which includes a notable announcement made by a Kmart employee in the 1980s that became a viral sensation. The recording showcases the employee's enthusiastic delivery while making announcements over the store's PA system, creating a nostalgic and humorous moment from retail history. The archive allows users to listen to the audio, emphasizing its cultural significance and popularity as a piece of internet meme history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, fun! These came up on HN a few years ago[0]. Recycling some of comment from then:The "Tower Sound and Communications" (TSC) company that recorded many of these was located a few miles up the road from my home town. The booming male voice on the recordings also sounded familiar to me, too. I'm fairly certain I heard him on the local radio station that my father played over the PA system in our family grocery store when I was growing up.Turns out that Cecil "Lee" Rutherford, the voice on the recordings, did VO work for local radio stations near my home town, too. He died in November, 2020.He was involved in some ventures that persist today. His company EchoSat[1] (which I'd heard of because I had some involvement in the convenience store / retail petroleum industry) merged with an IT security firm to become "ControlScan", doing PCI testing stuff because gas stations and credit cards.Quoting the obituary[2]:He started Tower Sound and Communications while in Greenville to pursue a venture that would eventually spearhead "in store" broadcasting for companies such as Kmart (he became the voice of Kmart) and Jamesway which evolved into another corporation in KY called EchoSat that would use satellite technology in helping with multiple stores for POS processing and security.There's an interview with Lee Rutherford in 2011.[3] He absolutely still has that "radio voice".[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25271464[1] https://www.dandb.com/businessdirectory/towercommunicationsg...[2] https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dailyadvocate/obituary.asp...[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQqoQL3pkyI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wild to actually hear the prices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this doesn't sound rude, but I'm trying to understand the model here.Does this mean that instead of incentivizing new utility-scale buildouts, you've now created a credits marketplace where no new solar is added but existing small rooftop installations are suddenly eligible, flooding the market with an artificially increased supply?So companies can buy RECs that don't actually increase the installed solar base, claim that it offsets their pollution, but in reality it's just some accounting trickery that's newly counting solar that's already built?That's what it sounds like at first glance, but maybe I'm misunderstanding?Maybe in the long run, if the automation itself drives further adoption and increases solar uptake, it's a net positive..?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, it's great to see new stuff happening in the solar space, and helping use incentives that are there. I wish you success!&gt; This domain is a good fit for automation and LLMs—not to generate text, but to (1) structure unstructured documents, (2) interact with legacy government websites where there’s no API, and (3) deal with repetitive bureaucratic language.This isn't a criticism of what you're doing, but a more general gripe/musing about the wider software and AI ecosystem. I've seen this in my own work too. I feel very unhappy that we are using complex, nondeterministic, power-hungry "intelligent" machines to solve the problem of... unstructured data. Instead of... structuring the data.I know you can't solve that problem. But nevertheless, wouldn't it be better for society as a whole if "we" agreed to make data accessible in machine-readable ways that don't require human-like agents to piece together the mess?This is a writ-large version of the joke about writing an email in bullet points, inflating it to paragraphs using an LLM, then the receiver summarising the paragraphs back to bullet points using an LLM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really great! I have solar on my roof at home but am not sure who owns the RECs - me, the installer, the utility company, rando Jon Doe? Does your platform provide a method to confirm that as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705065</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 'explanation' in the article is a little thin:Why is the packing fraction 55% maximum (in globular proteins)? "The answer seems to be that the packing fraction stops increasing when the protein cores jam or rigidify." Ok, so ...&gt; "That is, the individual amino acids that make up the protein core couldn't compress any further when the protein folded"So they can't pack any further because they 'jam'? Ohhh, from the abstract of the paper:&gt; "... However, important developments in the physics of jamming in particulate systems can shed light on the packing of protein cores. ... Then, we develop an all-atom model for proteins and find that, above ∼0.55, protein cores undergo a jamming-like transition"Possibly this is related to the need for protein cores to remain relatively 'liquid', as enzymes (for example) need to be somewhat flexible when binding/releasing substrates. A fully 'jammed'/packed core would lead to an inflexible structure with lower ability to ... er... move, bind stuff (I'm handwaving here :) )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the kind of cool stuff I'm going to miss during the coming dark ages. When ever I read this in a paper:"The authors acknowledge support from NIH Training Grant No. T32GM145452 (A.T.G., C.S.O., and Z.L.), NIH Training Grant No. T15LM007056-37 (J.A.L.), and the High Performance Computing facilities operated by Yale's Center for Research Computing."All of these things (the NIH and Yale's Center for Research Computing) relied so heavily on government funding that they are no longer getting, especially if they don't sing ideologically pure songs for dear Leader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for perspective, monodisperse spheres max out at 74% (hexagonal close packing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43681132</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The document outlines the National Science Foundation's "Endless Frontier" initiative in its 75th year, emphasizing the importance of advancing science and technology to drive economic growth and address societal challenges. It highlights key programs and funding opportunities aimed at fostering innovation, supporting research and education, and enhancing collaboration between academia, industry, and government. The initiative aims to ensure the United States remains at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological leadership, stressing the critical role of research in solving complex global problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see this posted here.With the changing world order, I have been studying what happened in and after WWII to learn how science helped shift the center of power from Europe to the US. 
We Europeans have very little knowledge of exactly how to take the big bets that has served the US militarily and economically since then.Here’s some of my (slightly rambling) notes from reading the Endless Frontier with this aim:https://skaersoe.com/2025/03/19/lessons-from-vannevar-bush-o...Currently I’m looking for like minded people to communicate the gap: https://frontier.ngo/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bush's report was submitted in the months between the German surrender and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. It was a remarkable context for scientific optimism, given the huge impact of science and technology on the war effort. Radar developments are obviously an unalloyed good for shooting down German bombers.Scientific progress is arguably even more relevant today, but the vision of the future has changed for the average American. Many achievements of the ensuing eight decades (vaccines eliminating polio and measles, nuclear energy, computing and social networks, cheap solar and wind, fracking, automation and artificial intelligence, cheap spaceflight) are viewed with fear and suspicion by large, different fractions of the US. Unfortunately, ceding scientific leadership to other powers does not reduce the destabilizing force of progress -- but I think there's some explanatory power here in simultaneously shutting down science and pursuing economic isolationism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy to think USA went from “Cabinet of scientific minds” to “LinkedIn All-Stars of political loyalty and TV appearances.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705796</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage showcases a project called "Torque" that presents an interactive installation designed to explore the concept of kinetic energy and movement. It features a series of dynamic sculptures that respond to user interaction, using sensors and motors to create a visually engaging experience. The project emphasizes the relationship between technology and art, inviting viewers to reflect on the physics of motion while engaging with the artistic elements. The overall goal is to spark curiosity and encourage exploration of the interplay between science and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool and I like the idea of a "meta-assembler." The most-recent version of flatassembler (fasm 2) is built with fasmg which is also a "meta-assembler" of sorts, in that it also doesn't directly support a specific instruction set and instead is a very powerful macro assembler. I'm keen to check out functionality overlaps between the two implementations.https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=19389https://flatassembler.net/download.php&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super fun site!Did you get inspiration from other assemblers or macro processors?You have it running on a TRS-80, how does that work? I had no idea Rust could target a TRS-80.I am getting hints of Forth, Lisp and TCL.How would you go about laying out structs in memory?I am sure you considered an internal DSL, what caused you go with something stand alone?Any thoughts on adding a constraint solver, like Z3 and allowing end users to set constraints on things like the size of a jump.I could see taking this an growing it into a compiler by making macro(macro(macros txt)))Is there an internal IR?Projects for inspirationhttps://github.com/mattbierner/Template-AssemblySpecifying representations of machine instructions

It's about making it easy to write assemblers. So this isn't for your Arms and RISC-Vs it's for your random niche microcontrollers where the vendor-provided toolchain kinda sucks.Seems cool!I've experienced a couple of under-documented assemblers in my time. In neither case did this turn out to be that much of a problem in practice, but I guess I just don't write that much assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43698801</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, this: "random() was returning values in int range rather than long." is a very nice bug find. Randomness is VERY hard to check for humans. For example, Python's binomial distribution is very bad on some inputs [1], giving widely wrong values, but nobody found it. I bumped into it when I implemented an algorithm to compute the approximate volume of solutions to a DNF, and the results were clearly wrong [2]. The algorithm is explained here by Knuth, in case you are interested [3][1] https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Slides/meel-distform.pdf
[2] https://github.com/meelgroup/pepin
[3] https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/cvm-note.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; String to float conversion had a table missing four values. This caused an array access overflow which resulted in imprecise values in some cases.I've once wrote a function to parse the date format from log files that Go doesn't natively support, and forgot to add November. I quit that job in April, so I never saw any issues. However when 1st of November came my ex-colleagues saw no logs for this day, and when they found out the reason they created a hash tag #nolognovember which you can probably find somewhere to this day :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the vast bulk of sanitizer complaints came from invoking undefined or implementation-defined behavior in harmless waysThis is patently false. Any Undefined Behavior is harmful because it allows the optimizer to insert totally random code, and this is not a purely theoretical behavior, it's been repeatedly demonstrated happening. So even if your UB code isn't called, the simple fact it exists may make some seemingly-unrelated code behave wrongly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678909</guid></item><item><title>26.

Parsing both HTML and templating syntax at the same time is way more robust than doing just the templating and hoping for the best.I was thinking about something like this, but with some blend of Jinja2 / Twig / Nunjucks [1] syntax and Svelte/JSX-like use of variables in element attributes:  {% for para in page.body %}
    &lt;p class={{ para.class }} {{ **para.attrs }}&gt;

All of the models compared (in the table on the huggingface link) are 1-2 billion parameters but the models range in actual size by more than a factor of 10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think almost all the free LLMs (not AI) that you find on hf can 'run on CPUs'.The claim here seems to be that it runs usefully fast on CPU.We're not sure how accurate this claim is, because we don't know how fast this model runs on a GPU, because:  &gt; Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs [...]


And TFA doesn't really quantify anything, just offers:  &gt; Perhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size — in some cases, twice the speed — while using a fraction of the memory.

The model they link to is just over 1GB in size, and there's plenty of existing 1-2GB models that are quite serviceable on even a mildly-modern CPU-only rig.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711227</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I coach startup founders, I walk them through a very simple 4 step process when we meet:1. What have you learnt since we last met and how has that altered your priors?2. What do you now believe is the most important problem you should be solving?3. What's currently blocking you from solving that problem?4. How do we overcome those blocks?Crucial to this process is that Q1 is not what have you done, it's what have you learnt. I do not give a shit about anything you've done if it's not in the service of learning.I also run a retro every 3 months with founders where we ask the following questions:1. What would you want to tell yourself 3/6/12 months ago (essentially, all the lessons learnt in italics) to save the maximum amount of pain?2. When did you learn each specific thing?3. When was the earliest you could have learnt that thing?4. What changes can we make going forward to minimize that delta?Extremely simple things but extraordinarily powerful when applied consistently over a long enough span of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting and they make some good observations but I can't help but think the deck was stacked against them because they are trying to come up with a technical/business solution to what is fundamentally a political problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for writing this!&gt; Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning permission is difficult.Isn't the real problem that supply is artificially constrained because house prices and the economy are interlinked in a way in a special way in the UK economy, such that the majority of home owners don't want it changed (because more supply == downward pricing pressure)I think the only entity that could meaningfully change this situation is government, and well it's easier to not upset your donors.Edit:
To be fair to the author, they do mention artificial supply constraints but I think my point stands - it is there by design, too much inertia forcing it to be that way that won't be changed by streamlining the bureaucratic elements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43703682</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Fibonacci hashing as an optimization technique that offers an alternative to traditional integer modulo operations in hash functions. It highlights the inefficiencies associated with modulo operations and explains how Fibonacci hashing leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to improve distribution and speed in hash tables. The author provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's mechanics, its advantages, and practical applications, emphasizing its potential to enhance performance in various computational scenarios while reducing collisions and improving data retrieval efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why the golden ratio? Because the continued fraction of the golden ratio is all 1's [0]. So it is uniquely hard to approximate with a rational number. The golden ratio is the bound on Hurwitz's theorem [1]. And avoiding a rational number is what you want for good hashing, because multiplying with a rational number doesn't mix your digits well.[0] https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/48589/generate-...
[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz%27s_theorem_(number_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author has misunderstood things here.This technique is orthogonal to integer mod.  Indeed the author multiplies by their magic constant and then does an integer mod to map into their hashtable's buckets.This technique is actually just applying a fast integer hash on the input keys to the hashtable before mapping the keys to buckets.  You can then map to buckets however you want.The additional hash is useful if and only if the input hash function for your table's keys doesn't appear to be a random function, i.e. it doesn't mix its bits for whatever reason.  If your input hash functions are indeed random then this is a (small but perhaps measurable) waste of time.Using prime-numbered table sizes is another way to accomplish basically the same thing.  Dividing the input hash key by a prime forces you to look at all the bits of the input.  In practice these are written as division by a constant, so they use multiplies and shifts.  It's basically a hash function.  (Though I'd use multiply by a magic number over divide by a prime, mul alone should be faster.)Relatedly see this post by Daniel Lemire about an alternative to integer mod, https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-... which is interesting if your number of buckets is not a power of 2 for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is both confused and confusing. What he's really talking about is not a hash function but a pseudorandom permutation (functionally the same as a block cipher), i.e. a pseudorandom bijective function on an integer domain. In the context of hash functions this is often called a "mixer" or "finalizer" (since it's applied as the final step before determining the bucket). Multiplication by the golden ratio is about the simplest such permutation, but it's far inferior to others (several of which I catalogued here, along with their inverses: https://github.com/senderista/hashtable-benchmarks/tree/mast...). The important thing to remember is that multiplication only mixes low bits into high bits, but you should also mix high bits into low bits (e.g. with XOR), as I do here with the "golden ratio" multiplier: https://github.com/senderista/hashtable-benchmarks/blob/mast....One useful property of permutations is that they're reversible, so you can reconstruct a key from its hash code, which is useful for hash tables with integer keys. I used this technique here to avoid storing keys separately from hash codes: https://github.com/senderista/hashtable-benchmarks/blob/mast....Applying a separate "mixer" function to the result of a user-supplied hash function makes sense only if the quality of the user's hash function is suspect. If you control the hash function yourself then there's no reason to use one (as I mentioned, a high-quality hash function will include a finalizer anyway). And if you do use a mixer, you should use a better one than this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43677122</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is the [final function in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-optimize-your-python-p...):  
(Regular Python `int` is arbitrary precision, but immutable, so I use `gmpy2.xmpz` instead.)    def tetrate(a, tetrate_acc):
        assert is_valid_other(a), "not a valid other"
        assert is_valid_accumulator(tetrate_acc), "not a valid accumulator"
        assert a &gt; 0, "we don't define 0↑↑b"

        exponentiate_acc = xmpz(1)
        for _ in count_down(tetrate_acc):
            multiply_acc = xmpz(1)
            for _ in count_down(exponentiate_acc):
                add_acc = xmpz(0)
                for _ in count_down(multiply_acc):
                    for _ in range(a):
                        add_acc += 1
                multiply_acc = add_acc
            exponentiate_acc = multiply_acc
        return exponentiate_acc

And here is the final function in Rust:  
(I used `&amp;mut` instead of returned values because I don't think Rust guarantees that returned owned values aren't copied.)    fn tetrate(a: u32, acc: &amp;mut BigUint) {
        assert!(a &gt; 0, "we don’t define 0↑↑b");

        let mut exp = BigUint::from(1u32);
        for () in acc.count_down() {
            let mut mul = BigUint::from(1u32);
            for () in exp.count_down() {
                let mut add = BigUint::ZERO;
                for () in mul.count_down() {
                    for _ in 0..a {
                        add += 1u32;
                    }
                }
                mul = add;
            }
            exp = mul;

        *acc = exp;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was an nice little machine. But since it used the UCSD P-System, a slow interpreter, it was rather slow if you needed to compute anything.(In my aerospace company days, our group evaluated a large number of forgotten machines, from the Apollo Domain and Symbolics 3600 down to the Terak. This was the era of weird UNIX workstations and things that were sort of like IBM PCs, but different. So I got to see most of the hardware of that era. Eventually settled on Sun 2 machines and 4.3BSD.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We used these for my first CS class at UCSB in 1979 running the UCSD P-System and they were great machines. It was frankly a much better system than the shared university IBM mainframe clone based computers used for other first year courses which used PL/1. Playing Space Invaders was one of the more popular activities on the Terak.The compiler/run/debug &amp; repeat cycle was light years ahead of how we developed on the mainframe. On the mainframe, using PL/1, you had a global onerror handler that would dump all variables and do a core dump of your program failed/crashed. The output was on from a line printer that you usually got a few hours after you submitted your job. On average you got 1 maybe 2 job runs a day. At least we didn’t have to use punch cards like the electrical engineers did for their Fortran programs; we used “glass TTYs” where we could save our virtual cards to a file system and later modify. Oh, and you needed to have the magic JCL cards at the beginning or your job. Those were the days.Later that year the CS dept got their own VAX and from then on most coursework was done on that system using BSD Unix. The EE’s still had to use punch cards on the mainframe.We did have a few other systems for some courses but the majority of stuff ended up being C or Pascal on Unix (with the occasional language like lisp or prolog for some classes.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those graphics look really nicely done (especially the GIF); I actually wish matplotlib or whatever the most popular data viz libraries are had a feature that would make them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43708726</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses four distinct kinds of optimization used in various contexts: local optimization, global optimization, Pareto optimization, and constraint optimization. Local optimization focuses on improving a solution within a limited area, while global optimization seeks the best overall solution across the entire problem space. Pareto optimization involves finding solutions that are efficient in multiple objectives without compromising one for another. Lastly, constraint optimization deals with achieving the best outcome while adhering to specific limitations. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding these different approaches to effectively tackle complex problems and make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The blog post is really good. I see that there's a follow-up piece 'The Fifth Kind of Optimisation' about parallelism.Something that I'd like to add is that it's helpful to understand the optimization capabilities of our compiler. Ideally, we would like to write program that doesn't have what are called 'optimization-blockers' - these make it hard for the compiler to generate optimized executables.I like the pointer to the blog on accidentally quadratic implementations. I find that the following pattern is often a landmine:for (int i = 0; i &lt; strlen(s); i++)
 // code in loopstrlen(s) gets computed every iteration, incurring O(n) time.Finally, being aware that I/O latencies are major source of bottlenecks leads to nice optimizations. One advantage of multiple threads is that they can sometimes hide the I/O latency. In general, writing programs with good memory locality is one of the better levers for optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've spent a lot of time jumping in to optimise horrendously complicated programs and data pipelines and things.  The big wins are from understanding the domain and spotting all the inevitable misunderstandings and unnecessary steps that creep in when systems are so big they get split up and built/maintained by different people at different times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is missing the 5th and most important optimization technique: don't pessimize the code in the first place.The usual culprit is "premature modularization", where code that is used in one place and is never going to be extended is nonetheless full of indirections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679831</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "A Blast from the Past" reflects on nostalgic memories, emphasizing how past experiences shape our identities and influence our current perspectives. It explores the emotional impact of revisiting old places, reconnecting with childhood friends, and revisiting previous life stages, illustrating how these moments evoke powerful feelings and insights about personal growth and change over time. The author shares anecdotes that capture the essence of these memories and their significance in fostering a sense of belonging and continuity in life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UCSD p-System was amazing.  I used it on a Heathkit-branded PDP-11, the Apple II, and an HP-9000 workstation; and though the author doesn't mention it, the first version of Borland's Turbo Pascal for CP/M and DOS had a UI that was clearly influenced by the p-System's UI.The coolest thing about UCSD Pascal when I first encountered it was it supported "full screen" programs, notably the system's text editor, via the `gotoxy(x, y)` intrinsic.  This procedure moved the cursor to the specified character cell on the terminal.  Prior to this I'd only used line-oriented editors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 1995, our high school "Pascal I" and "Pascal II" classes were taught in a forgotten Apple //e lab in the Math wing of the school. The PC and Mac labs were occupied by typing, word processing, and desktop publishing classes. I think every other kid in class groaned, but to a hamfest scrounger of PDPs, Vaxen, and weird UNIX workstations, UCSD p-System Pascal on Apple hardware was weirdly intriguing, the cherry on top being that the whole lab was served by a Corvus hard disk shared over, I think, an "Omninet" network. We'd all come in, turn on the lights, turn on the computers, and then have the lecture portion of class while this poor early NAS would serve Pascal to 20-odd machines simultaneously. I think we saved our work on floppy disks, though maybe that was a backup, as I think I recall turning in our work by saving to the Corvus? Even at the time, it all had a very "you are living the early experimental days" feeling to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I "recently" wrote a CP/M emulator, and I have a lot of love for the kinda vintage software out there that still runs on it.https://github.com/skx/cpmulator/Over the past few days I've seen posts on hacker news discussion 6502 assembly, people coming to the infocom games, and similar things.  There's a lot of interest out there in this retro stuff, even now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43707805</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The Bauplan Labs documentation provides comprehensive guidelines and resources for using the Bauplan Labs platform, which focuses on tools for building and managing cloud-native applications and services. The documentation covers various topics such as installation, configuration, operational best practices, and troubleshooting. It aims to assist developers and teams in effectively utilizing the platform to enhance their cloud development and deployment processes, ensuring optimal performance and scalability of their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking to get feedback for a code-first platform for data: instead of custom frameworks, GUIs, notebooks on a chron, bauplan runs SQL / Python functions from your IDE, in the cloud, backed by your object storage. Everything is versioned and composable: time-travel, git-like  branches, scriptable meta-logic.Perhaps surprisingly, we decided to co-design the abstractions and the runtime, which allowed novel optimizations at the intersection of FaaS and data - e.g. rebuilding functions can be 15x faster than the corresponding AWS stack (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17465). All capabilities are available to humans (CLI) and machines (SDK) through simple APIs.Would love to hear the community’s thoughts on moving data engineering workflows closer to software abstractions: tables, functions, branches, CI/CD etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks interesting! Bauplan seems like a mix of an orchestration engine and a data warehouse. It's similar to Motherduck as it runs DuckDB on managed EC2, with more data engineer-focused branching and Python support similar to SQLMesh.It's interesting that most vendors compute in their own managed account instead of BYOC though. I understand it's hard to manage compute on the customer cloud for vendors, but I was under the impression that it's a no-go for most enterprise companies. Maybe I'm wrong?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Git-like approach to data versioning seems really promising to me, but I'm wondering what those merge operations are expected to look like in practice. In a coding environment, I'd review the PR basically line-by-line to check for code quality, engineering soundness, etc. But in the data case it's not clear to me that a line-by-line review would be possible, or even useful; and I'm also curious about what (if any) tooling is provided to support it?For example: I saw the YouTube video demo someone linked here where they had an example of a quarterly report pipeline. Say that I'm one of two analysts tasked with producing that report, and my coworker would like to land a bunch of changes. Say in their data branch, the topline report numbers are different from `main` by X%. Clearly it's due to some change in the pipeline, but it seems like I will still have to fire up a notebook and copy+paste chunks of the pipeline to see step-by-step where things are different. Is there another recommended workflow (or even better: provided tooling) for determining which deltas in the pipeline contributed to the X% difference?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705991</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a massive data leak orchestrated by the hacking group Anonymous, which reportedly released 10 terabytes of sensitive information related to Russia. This data contains shocking revelations about government operations, corruption, and other misconduct. The leak has the potential to impact international relations, expose high-level officials, and escalate tensions between Russia and other nations. The article outlines the contents of the leak and explores its implications for both Russian citizens and the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

After reviewing the contents for about 30 minutes, the data appears technically authentic—not AI-generated—but nothing particularly noteworthy stood out.The files "Vulnerabilities/Fetched Data.txt" appear to be output from an automated security scanner that targeted public-facing web servers. Some directory labels are inaccurate. For instance, a company listed as a crypto exchange—Cryptopro—is actually an IT consulting firm focused on cryptography and PKI.A number of Word, Excel, and PDF files containing corporate reports and similar materials appear to be publicly accessible online and even indexed by search engines. I was able to locate several by searching their titles.One file, "Part 1/Report those Russian ringleaders/russRingleadersPerDFUNAFO.txt", seems to be the likely source of the "Kremlin Assets in the West" mention. It’s a brief list of Twitter accounts and may have been assembled through open-source intelligence methods.While the leak might contain some mistakenly published or sensitive material, I didn’t come across anything as significant or dramatic as implied by the article linked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a quick scan of the file listing of the 18GB compressed folder linked for download elsewhere, looks like it's a collection of completely random data hacked over a number of years from various accounts that may or may not be connected with Russia (Guy Ritchie?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using a Google Form with a single prompt to journal since 2016https://x.com/kenwarner/status/1436385090679017477I go for long walks at night a few times a week and find myself journaling a lot then. It got annoying to stop my walk to type out a thought so much, eventually I started primarily voice typing instead.But I still had to stop and pull up the Google form, then start voice typing, fix any mistakes, and then continue the walk. So I moved on to just turning on a recording app on during the walks and just start talking whenever I want without having to stop or pull out my phone.https://x.com/kenwarner/status/1817348131291291892I transcribe the audio file when I get home and add it with a summary to the journal.Now I keep a livestream going while I'm working at my PC and transcribe and summarize whatever happens there too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracking stock trades is one of the most advanced uses of audio journaling I've seen– wow! You're pushing that into an area I had not thought of, very cool.I made Stardate[0] for my own voice journaling and use it similarly. I track how much my dog weighs, sailing hours and notes, and new issues I find in the app. Recently I used it to make a daily checklist on paper by feeding the notes into LaTeX[1]. There's just so much to explore here![0] https://stardateapp.com[1] https://www.deanputney.com/blog/2025/03/20/Paper-Checklist-P...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coincidentally, this weekend I've started my open-source AI-assisted journaling tool: https://github.com/neblinedev/neblineFor now it only supports insights with Anthropic Claude 3.7 and there are some must have features that are missing, but I've got a prototype in a weekend and I'm proud of it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678023</guid></item><item><title>49. 100th Anniversary of the Great Gatsby: The Chicago Connection</title><link>https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/09/photos-chicagos-connection-to-the-great-gatsby/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the tension between API churn and security in software development. It highlights how frequent changes to APIs can lead to vulnerabilities, as developers may overlook security considerations while making quick updates or modifications. The author emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, where maintaining a stable API is crucial for security, and suggests practices for minimizing churn while ensuring that security measures are effectively integrated into the development process. The piece advocates for thoughtful planning and communication around API changes to enhance both functionality and security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to be careful on how and where we define our constraints regardless, but we can mitigate against this to some degree for some APIs:&gt;The problem with these increasingly expressive end points is that you are putting them not just in the hands of your front end developers, but also in the hands of potentially hostile users.Meaning, let's not expose to 'hostile users' if we can help it.For example, put the API gateway solely on a private overlay, and gate entrance to that overlay to endpoints with enrolled private key signed certs (+ other factors if you wish).Puts more burden on the API clients - e.g. PKI enrollment, management, etc. would need to be reliable, automated and abstracted.So infeasible or too much friction for some APIs, but this would reduce the attack surface for a B2B API with a limited number of consumers...and many of those would take that tradeoff?Of course, we still wouldn't 'trust' the private network overlay in our API definitions...it would just be one more layer of security if access is gated with modern cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aaaayyyy yooo, i wrote this a long time ago, but I think it holds up!TLDR: there is a trade off in how much expressive power you can surface to front-end developers when their logic is written in-browser because anything you give to them, you give to anyone who can open up a console.  That makes things a lot more dangerous and is in contrast w/ the back end, where you can give developers access to a full SQL implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;intercooler.js is the forerunner of htmx.org - by the same author&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679219</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The incident report outlines a service disruption affecting Zoom's functionality, specifically detailing the cause, impact, and resolution timeline. It includes updates on the resolution process, confirmation of service restoration, and any ongoing monitoring efforts to ensure stability. The report emphasizes Zoom's commitment to transparency and communication during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To try to convince my employer at the time to drop Zoom, I decided to see how many security vulns I could find in 2-3 hours.Found 12 confirmed bugs in that window using only binwalk and osint.The worst was that I noticed the zoom.us godaddy account password reset email address was the personal gmail account of Eric S Yuan, the CEO.So, I tried to do a password reset on his gmail account. No 2FA, and only needed to answer two reset questions. Hometown, and phone number. Got those from public data and got my reset link, and thus, the ability to control the zoom.us domain name.They were unable to find a single English speaking security team member to explain these bugs to, and it took them 3 months to confirm them and pay me $800 in bug bounties, total, for all 12 bugs.The one bright side is this did convince my employer to drop them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That seriously devalues MarkMonitor's services. MarkMonitor claims to be a 
"an ICANN-accredited registrar and recognized industry leader since 1999".
The whole point of paying for MarkMonitor is that they're an expensive service for valuable domains and are not allowed to screw up. GoDaddy should not be involved here at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godaddy is such an incompetent organisation. Should not be allowed to administer anything of importance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711957</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architecturally, it is a scale-out metadata filesystem [ref]. Other related distributed file systems are Collosus, Tectonic (Meta), ADLSv2 (Microsoft), HopsFS (Hopsworks), and I think PolarFS (Alibaba). They all use different distributed row-oriented DBs for storing metadata. S3FS uses FoundationDB, Collosus uses BigTable, Tectonic some KV store, ADLSv2 (not sure), HopsFS uses RonDB.What's important here with S3FS is that it supports (1) a fuse client - it just makes life so much easiter - and (2) NVMe storage - so that training pipelines aren't Disk I/O bound (you can't always split files small enough and parallel reading/writing enough to a S3 object store).Disclaimer: i worked on HopsFS. HopsFS adds tiered storage - NVMe for recent data and S3 for archival.[ref]:  https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/scalable-metadata-the-new-bree...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that the author is spot on, there are a couple of dimensions in which you should evaluate these systems: theoretical limits, efficiency, and practical limits.From a theoretical point of view, like others have pointed out, parallel distributed file systems have existed for years -- most notably Lustre. These file systems should be capable of scaling out their storage and throughput to, effectively, infinity -- if you add enough nodes.Then you start to ask, well how much storage and throughput can I get with a node that has X TiB of disk -- starting to evaluate efficiency. I ran some calculations (against FSx for Lustre, since I'm an AWS guy) -- and it appears that you can run 3FS in AWS for about 12-30% cheaper depending on the replication factors that you choose against FSxL (which is good, but not great considering that you're now managing the cluster yourself).Then, the third thing you start to ask is anecdotally, are people able to actually configure these file systems into the size of deployment that I want (which is where you hear things like "oh it's hard to get Ceph to 1 TiB/s") -- and that remains to be seen from something like 3FS.Ultimately, I obviously believe that storage and data are really important keys to how these AI companies operate -- so it makes sense that DeepSeek would build something like this in-house to get the properties that they're looking for. My hope is that we, at Archil, can find a better set of defaults that work for most people without needing to manage a giant cluster or even worry about how things are replicated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m interested in how it is compared to seaweedfs[1], which we use for storing weather data (about 3 PB) for ML training.[1] https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43716058</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces Gemini 2.5, a new AI model developed by Google that enhances user experience by supporting a variety of applications, including text, image, and video generation. It highlights the model’s capabilities, such as improved contextual understanding and multilingual proficiency. The article encourages developers to explore Gemini 2.5's features through provided resources and tools, emphasizing its potential for creating innovative applications across different domains.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google making Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) free was a big deal. I haven't tried the more expensive OpenAI models so I can't even compare, only to the free models I have used of theirs in the past.Gemini 2.5 Pro is so much of a step up (IME) that I've become sold on Google's models in general. It not only is smarter than me on most of the subjects I engage with it, it also isn't completely obsequious. The model pushes back on me rather than contorting itself to find a way to agree.100% of my casual AI usage is now in Gemini and I look forward to asking it questions on deep topics because it consistently provides me with insight. I am building new tools with the mind to optimize my usage to increase it's value to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini flash models have the least hype, but in my experience in production have the best bang for the buck and multimodal tooling.Google is silently winning the AI race.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An often overlooked feature of the Gemini models is that they can write and execute Python code directly via their API.My llm-gemini plugin supports that: https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini  uv tool install llm
  llm install llm-gemini
  llm keys set gemini
  # paste key here
  llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 \
    -o code_excution 1 \
    'render a mandelbrot fractal in ascii art'

I ran that just now and got this: https://gist.github.com/simonw/cb431005c0e0535343d6977a7c470...They don't charge anything extra for code execution, you just pay for input and output tokens. The above example used 10 input, 1,531 output which is $0.15/million for input and $3.50/million output for Gemini 2.5 Flash with thinking enabled, so 0.536 cents (just over half a cent) for this prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43720845</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to leave Spotify and the subsequent impact of this choice on their music consumption and emotional well-being. The author reflects on the initial challenges of adjusting to a life without the platform, including feelings of loss and the struggle to find new music sources. Over time, however, they discover the benefits of exploring music more intentionally and connecting with artists in meaningful ways, ultimately leading to a more satisfying and enriching listening experience. The piece emphasizes the importance of mindful engagement with music rather than passive consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article fails to mention the absolute butchering of features that takes place moving from a typical music streaming subscription to a self hosted Jellyfin library.A large part of my listening on YouTube Music is going to a particular song or band I like and clicking "Radio", which generates a playlist of similar sounding songs. You can then fine tune it with a filter i.e "Popular songs, deep cuts" or specific elements of the song "More emo", "Slow paced" etc. This exposes me to a lot of new music and keeps it fresh and if I'm lucky I'll discover a new artist or song to add to my rotations.You lose that.A lot of these services overtime build mixes which takes your listening habits and tries to categorize them into specific mixes made up of your existing library &amp; new music.I don't browse any music forums and so apart from my favourite bands, I have no idea on when artists I like release new albums and would not encounter them on a self hosted solution, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally use Jellyfin ONLY for Video stuff.AudioBookShelf[1] is for audiobooks and podcasts.For music I use  navidrome [2]

The smart playlist feature[5] is awesome. Having 3 services instead of one seems overkill, but specialized apps instead of one generic one feels different. One interesting aspect of navidrome is, that it has implemented the Subsonic API, which MANY Apps make use of. My personal favorite is  Substreamer [3]

but you could also go with DSub[4] or others.1: https://www.audiobookshelf.org/2: https://www.navidrome.org/3: https://substreamerapp.com/4: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/github.daneren2005.dsub/5: https://www.navidrome.org/docs/usage/smartplaylists/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For music, Navidrome is superior.It is just crazy how easy it is to set this stuff up nowadays. I run both Navidrome and Jellyfin in docker containers. Then I use NordVPN Meshnet to securely connect to them outside of the home.The experience is absolutely flawless. In Navidrome you can host an entire FLAC library and then transcode to Opus on the fly.It's been over a year now and I have pretty much no issues whatsoever.I highly highly recommend itEdit - Opus not Opal!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711706</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems that much like Aider, you use separate models for creating code edits and validating them. That's a win in my book. It seems Claude Code does not do that, which is part of the reason it racks up a (relatively) large bill for long work sessions (that and the cost of sonnet-3.7).I bounce back and forth between Aider, Claude Code, and Simon Willison's LLM tool ("just" a GOOD wrapper for using LLMs at the CLI, unlike the other two which are agent-y.) LLM is my favorite because I usually don't need/want full autonomy, but Claude Code has started to win me over for straightforward stuff. Plandex looks cool enough to throw into the rotation!My main concern at this point is that I use a Mac and as far as I understand it Docker containers can have pretty poor performance on the Mac, so I'm wondering if that will carry over to performance of Plandex. (I don't use Docker at all so I'm not sure if that's outdated info.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed there's an example in the docs: plandex rm app/**/*.ts # by glob pattern.However, looking at the code (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/blob/main/app/cli/cmd/...), it seems you're using path/filepath for pattern matching, which doesn't support double star patterns. Here's a playground example showing that: https://go.dev/play/p/n8mFpJn-9iY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spend hours everyday researching AI products. Why am I only hearing about plandex now? Looks very promising, I’ll give it a try.
Please up your marketing game, the product looks solid!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43710576</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence of HDR (High Dynamic Range) emojis, highlighting their benefits in enhancing the visual quality and expressiveness of emoticons in digital communication. It explains how HDR emojis offer a wider range of colors and improved detail, making them more vibrant and lifelike.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used (abused) HDR in an editorial project last year. We were working with an amazing illustrator doing a take on series of stories exploring the intersection of faith, storytelling, and technology.As the early versions of the images emerged we thought we could used HDR to provide more or a aura to some elements. We tried to make it subtle and not overwhelm.This example is my favorite:https://restofworld.org/2024/divinity-altered-reality-muslim...I think it worked well - and this technique would have been useful. We tried something similar but could not get it to work.Our method was to use a stretched HDR video in the background.Here are the steps I used:In Photoshop create white image to proportions required. Save as MP4:  File &gt; Export &gt; Render Video

Save as "sample.mp4"With the MP4, generate a HDR version in WEBM:  ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -color_primaries 9 -color_trc 16 -colorspace 9 -color_range 1 -profile:v 2 -vcodec libvpx-vp9 sample.webm

With the plain MP4, generate the HDR version:  ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -color_primaries 9 -color_trc 16 -colorspace 9 -color_range 1 -profile:v high10 -vcodec libx264 sample.mp4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was playing around with this a ton yesterday.One thing I was attempting to do was create an emoji that only had partial portions that had their brightness maxed, while the rest of the emoji displayed "normally". It turns out this was quite hard to do - most filters or scripts such as the one on this page simply max out the channels, which creates a "fried" look to the image.Gimp luckily has support for this, but getting an existing image to display the "same" with the new color space proved fairly difficult. I found this curve to be the best starting point, after which I edited things from there manually:

Is this really the best way to create and run Python sandboxes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hacked around with this a bit and figured out a way to get it to spit out logging of the prompts and responses to the server: https://gist.github.com/simonw/54fc42ef9a7fb8f777162bbbfbba4...Short-ish version:    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$(llm keys get anthropic)" \

            "stdio",
        ],
    )

    agent = Agent("claude-3-5-haiku-latest", mcp_servers=[server])

    async def main():
        with capture_run_messages() as messages:
            async with agent.run_mcp_servers():

&lt;p&gt;The article on Haskell concurrency provides an overview of concurrent programming in Haskell, discussing its unique features and advantages. It introduces concepts such as Software Transactional Memory (STM) and lightweight threads, illustrating how these tools facilitate concurrent tasks in a safe and efficient manner. The piece also covers practical examples and patterns for employing concurrency in Haskell applications, highlighting the language's ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without the typical pitfalls of race conditions and deadlocks. Overall, it serves as a guide for developers looking to leverage Haskell’s concurrency model to create robust software solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the footnotes:&gt; It gets weirder: in Haskell, exceptions can be thrown to other threads!What's really interesting is that because of purity, you have to have asynchronous exceptions otherwise you give up a lot of modularity. At least that's what Simons Marlow and Peyton Jones argue in Asynchronous Exceptions in Haskell (2006): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/...&gt; While the semi-asynchronous approach avoids breaking synchronization abstractions, it is non-modular in that the target code must be written to use the signalling mechanism. Worse still (for us), the semi-asynchronous approach is simply incompatible with a purely-functional language, such as Concurrent Haskell. The problem is that polling a global flag is not a functional operation, yet in a Concurrent Haskell program, most of the time is spent in purely-functional code. On the other hand, since there is absolutely no problem with abandoning a purely-functional computation at any point, asynchronous exceptions are safe in a functional setting. In short, in a functional setting, fully-asynchronous exceptions are both necessary and safe — whereas in an imperative context fully-asynchronous exceptions are not the only solution and are unsafe.If you can read PLTese, it's really quite a nice paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's maybe interesting to note that  the `async` library in use here is very simple and easy to understand. Nearly every function is one or two lines. Likewise `TQueue` is extremely simple (and easy to prove correct) thanks to STM, and also generally has good performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/parallel-and-concurrent... is a great resource for those who want to go deeper into this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679906</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long, long time ago (within the past ten years), I had to verify my age with a site. They didn't ask for my ID, or my facial scan, but instead asked for my credit card number.  They issued a refund to the card of a few cents, and I had to tell them (within 24hr) how much the refund was for, after which point they'd issue a charge to claw it back.  They made it clear that debit and gift cards would not be accepted, it must be a credit card.  So I grabbed my Visa card, punched in the numbers, checked my banking app to see the +$0.24 refund, entered the value, got validated, and had another -$0.24 charge to claw it back.Voila, I was verified as an adult, because I could prove I had a credit card.The whole point of mandating facial recognition or ID checks isn't to make sure you're an adult, but to keep records of who is consuming those services and tie their identities back to specific profiles.  Providers can swear up and down they don't retain that information, but they often use third-parties who may or may not abide by those same requests, especially if the Gov comes knocking with a secret warrant or subpoena.Biometric validation is surveillance, plain and simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think the problem is that young people are finding porn on the internet. There is a problem, though, and it has to deal with psychological warfare on attentionFormats like shorts or news feeds to you algorithmically with zero lag are the problem. It makes for the zombification of decision making. Endless content breaks people down  precisely because it's endless. I think if you add age verification but don't root out the endless nature, you will not really help any young person or adult.When you look at people with unhealthy content addiction, it is always a case of excess and not necessarily type of content. There are pedophiles but honestly, we have had that throughout all time, with and without the internet. But the endless feeding of the next video robs people of the ability to stop by mentally addiciting them to see just one more. And because content is not really infinite, endless feeds invariably will feed people with porn, eating disorders, and other   "crap" in quantities that slowly erode people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aside from the privacy nightmare, what about someone who is 18 and just doesn't have the traditional adult facial features? Same thing for someone who's 15 and hit puberty early? I can imagine that on the edges, it becomes really hard to discern.If they get it wrong, are you locked out? Do you have to send an image of your ID? So many questions. Not a huge fan of these recent UK changes (looking at the Apple E2E situation as well). I understand what they're going for, but I'm not sure this is the best course of action. What do I know though :shrug:.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715884</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on the reverse engineering of Milwaukee M18 batteries, detailing the process of disassembling and analyzing the battery's internal components. It discusses the design and materials used, potential issues related to performance and safety, and provides insights on improving battery longevity. Additionally, it highlights the overall importance of understanding lithium-ion battery technology, especially for users wanting to repair or enhance their power tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FWIW I find these batteries and the charger to be exceptional. You can just leave batteries in and it knows when to stop charging. If you get the big charger and put a bunch of batteries in it charges them round-robin style. And the batteries themselves seem to be sturdy, robust, and high capacity. They're also expensive af so you want to wait for a sale if possible. I even spent a ridiculous amount of money on the battery-powered wet/dry vac and haven't regretted it for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a substantial investment in both Dewalt and Milwaukee tools that I use regularly in my farming operation. I definitely prefer the Milwaukee tools to the Dewalt. I recently bought a 6" Milwaukee chain saw for light duty cutting. I get a lot of cuts before I have to change batteries. Also the torque in the Milwaukee 3/4" impact gun is truly amazing and the battery lasts through a lot of bolt removals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always love to see an in-depth reverse engineering write-up. This one's particularly interesting since I'm currently designing a battery pack for my own project.Interesting to see a microcontroller (and quite a classic one...) as well as an ASIC for battery management. I imagine it's for communication purposes. The battery management chips I've been looking at have built in I2C interfaces to let me avoid firmware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43718809</guid></item><item><title>14.

I want to use Claude pro/max with MCP and openai plus and gemini etc (even cursor/roo/cline) via the terminal without paying extra for the api as that makes no sense. Preferably one that has tabs to actually use multiple at the same time.This is quite excellent though; makes it easier to try different solutions and switch between them (considering they are all doing a race to get better).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the various "whoosh" sounds produced by passing planes and other objects, exploring the physics behind these noises, particularly the Doppler effect, which causes the pitch of the sound to change as the object moves relative to the listener. It highlights different scenarios in which these sounds occur, including the impact of speed and distance, and emphasizes the interesting auditory experience that accompanies these phenomena. Additionally, the writer touches on the emotional responses such sounds can evoke and the cultural significance they may carry in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm just armchair musing here, and I'm definitely no expert on sound waves, but I wonder if they considered the fact that most airliners have more than one engine. Could the effect also be the superposition of multiple engine sounds?Those have a fixed spatial distance, too, and the effect would (I suppose) change with the lateral angle to the listener during the fly-by. This theory should be pretty easy to falsify, because then the effect would not occur if the plane's path went exactly overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially relatedI once picked up my memory foam mattress and stood it up against one of the walls ... for cleaning the bed or whatever.As I walked past the mattress I instantly noticed that the mattress is such a good absorber of audio waves that I could immediately notice a dip in ambient sound in the ear facing the mattress.The room was already "silent" and this newly discovered lower limit of silence was pretty surprising to me physiologically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ground feature echo (mentioned in the article)... possible. Not mentioned here or in the article: thermocline in the atmosphere. Thermocline in the water is traditionally how submarines "hide" from surface ships.I hear flanging from the planes incoming from quite a distance, and they're pretty low when the fly over where I live. More telling: I can hear the freeway and the busy arterial, "depending on how the wind blows". Sometimes it flanges, too.So: ground reflection along with thermocline refraction seems a perfectly plausible explanation for one source of the phenomenon; could be several, probably all involving ground and atmospheric factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713524</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant yet often overlooked Battle of the Karakorum in the late 10th century, which played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of Central Asia. It illustrates how this battle between competing powers influenced trade routes, political alliances, and the emergence of new states in the region. By highlighting the impact of this forgotten conflict, the article aims to shed light on its importance in world history and its lasting effects on the cultural and geopolitical dynamics of the area.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The included descriptions of the battle’s aftermath are haunting.As much as movies and documentaries usually reflect the horrors of combat itself, they rarely deal with the aftermath - not lights out in an adrenaline fueled moment, but lying for hours in a random patch of land no longer having a mouth, trying to cry for help knowing that no one will come until dying from exposure and maggots.This was the reality for millions of young people; still is. Let’s hope we never see it firsthand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the title, I thought this was an article about The Kalinga War, a war so bloody it moved the Emperor Ashoka to embrace non-violence and spread Buddhism throughout Asia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting story which I didn't know. However, the author perspective is a bit flawed:But the world did get more peaceful. There was no World War III, and countries at least had to pay lip service to these universal values of peace and human rights.The world didn't really get more peaceful. Some nations which used to wage wars between themselves did not anymore after World War II (excluding "incidents" like Belgrade bombing). This doesn't diminish the rest of the article at all, if anything calls for more rules and diplomacy preventing war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711001</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, yeah. Adipocytes multiply when you get fat. But when you lose weight, they don't apoptose, they just shrink in volume by giving up their lipid stores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's struggled with weight loss, and have known others to struggle with it well, I think we colloquially called this "slow metabolism".It always did feel like it was easier to gain weight than lose it, especially fat weight and not muscle weight for me.I was recently sent a video about fat adaptation (basically teaching your body to be better at burning fat) by a very fit friend, but I wonder how much of that is bro science and how much of it is grounded in reality. Maybe worth looking into more deeply if it can counteract or balance out this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As this article shows, there are incredibly complex feedback mechanisms around weight and metabolism, but thermodynamics are still fundamentally a thing.After he died last year, I ran across this engineering and accounting approach to weight maintenance and loss written up by John Walker (one of the Autodesk founders).   It worked very well for him and changed the way I thought about weight and eating.   It is interesting reading because he is "one of us"    https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/

Basically, he uses a first level approximation of the body as a control system with a feedback loop, and tries to pin down some techniques to bring the system to a known good state (target weight) and manage that loop for long term stability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678138</guid></item><item><title>18.

Japanese battles involving castles almost always turned into sieges, and those always ended the same way: with the nearby fields and peasant settlements being either destroyed to try and draw the lord out of the castle or looted to feed the occupying army. Some researchers believe that Ujiharu was trying to avoid a siege to save his subjects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The writing style has me in stiches, it feels at odds with the layout and imagery, but completely fits the character of the story in question.I wonder how well a Real Housewives-style show would work set in the Sengoku-era.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the quotes in the article title I was thinking dang how have I never heard of that anime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714619</guid></item><item><title>19.

It highlights the competitive landscape of the early 1980s, technical specifications that set the 1200XL apart, and how marketing missteps and internal conflicts at Atari impacted its success.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1200XL was my first computer.  My family purchased it at a department store at a fire sale price (IIRC Montgomery Ward's, $199) after Atari stopped manufacturing and began dumping its inventory to make way for the 600XL/800XL.  I had been researching a computer to get for ages, but my family was very careful about how we spent money, and it was a big purchase.  We had seriously considered getting a TI-99/4A when TI exited the business, but we were concerned that it was just going to be a dead end.  But the chance for a cheaper entry into an established ecosystem was great (that and me begging my mother to finally, finally get a computer!).Re compatibility, I never came across software that didn't run on it.  I'd read in magazines that there were issues, but never once experienced it.  One interesting software change, though (but true of other XL computers, too) was that the color "artifacting" worked differently on it than it did the 400/800.  For example, Ultima III used color artifacting, and so playing it on my system produced some incorrect colors...most notably the sea was red.I did come across one hardware issue...a cheap third-party parallel interface adapter that didn't work, and that we thought at the time was defective, but I now think it's likely to have been affected by the incorrect power wiring in the 1200XL's SIO adapter.  It was cheap enough that we didn't lose too much money on it, and I ended up getting the far superior ICD P:R: Connection instead.The Atari community was a super great community to be in.  And in so many ways, Atari was doing things that wouldn't be seen again for years, if not decades.  Atari's SIO port is famously a predecessor/inspiration of USB.  The APX Exchange was basically a third-party app store decades before Apple popularized the concept.  The machine was hackable and moddable (I bought a 256KB upgrade kit for mine).  When I migrated to PC for college use, it hurt to have to fall back to CGA...even EGA was just ugly, compared to what my 1200XL was capable of (although the 80 column displays were nice compared to Atari's 40-column).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft was one of the first companies who fully internalized the importance of seamless backwards compatibility. The lessons had been around for a while, such as the fate of the 1200XL.They would have done a lot better, even at a higher price, if they had focused on it. The Atari 8-bit line had a lot going for it and was arguably superior (flame wars incoming, Atari army please help me) in many ways than the C64.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reports of other software incompatibilities due to the ROM changes would start to come out once the 1200XL was actually released and got into user’s hands, hurting its reputation.That wasn’t as big a deal in the 80s as it is now. Reputation was limited to real life friends and maybe a few homegrown newsletters or computer clubs.Very few people were using the Internet to share opinions in the early 1980s, so “reputation“ could be very effectively managed by Atari and other companies through advertising and leaning on trade media to suppress negative reviews and angry letters to the editor.That is, unless the problems were too big to ignore and customer anger became too great, as was the case with many late era Atari 2600 games.A bigger issue for the 1200XL was price as well as something not addressed in the article: competition. By this point there were other platforms to consider, often at better price points with attractive features and software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714476</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The arxiv preprint linked in this is really good. I'm American so I got my education on e from the compound interest limit which isn't natural at all, as Loh points out. Why should it matter how many times I "split up" my compounding?IMO exponentials should just not be taught at all without basic notions of calculus (slopes of tangent lines suffice, as Po Shen Loh does here). The geometric intuition matters more than how to algebraically manipulate derivatives. The differential equation is by far the most natural approach, and it deserves to be taught earlier to students as is done apparently in France and Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this may convince students, you haven't actually prove that any exponential function has a slope. The usual presentation doesn't even demonstrate that such functions are defined at irrational numbers.That said, it is worthwhile to go through the algebra exercise to convince yourself that, for large n, (1+x/n)^n expands out to approximately 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + ...Hint. The x^k terms come out to (x/n)^k (n choose k). This will turn out to be x^k/k! + O(x^k/n). As n goes to infinity, the error term drops out, and we're just left with the series that we want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How my high-school calculus textbook did it was to first define ln(x) so that ln(1) = 0 and d/dx ln(x) = 1/x, then take exp(x) as the inverse function of ln(x), and finally set e = exp(1). It's definitely a bit different from the exp-first formulation, but it does do a good job connecting the natural logarithm to a natural definition. (It's an interesting exercise to show, using only limit identities and algebraic manipulation, that this is equivalent to the usual compound-interest version of e.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43718988</guid></item><item><title>21.

But I think he's been directionally correct about all his major points in the past decade:* Cancel culture is not compatible with democratic norms [1]* Social media is making many people a little worse off and it makes some people a lot worse off* having our phones on us all the time is bad for just about everything that requires sustained attention [2], including flirting and dating [3]* Technology won't solve this problem. AI will make things worse [4]. If TikTok gets banned and some slightly more benevolent version takes it place, we're still headed in the wrong direction. What we need is culture change, which Haidt is trying his darndest at. Hats off to him.[0] https://matthewbjane.github.io/blog-posts/blog-post-7.html[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/23/business/jonathan-haidt-s...[2] https://thecritic.co.uk/its-the-phones-stupid/[3] https://www.sexual-culture.com/p/its-obviously-the-phones[4] https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/726709657/sometimes-fascinati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But when the Kentucky AG’s office was preparing to post their brief against TikTok, whoever was in charge of doing the redaction simply covered the relevant text with black rectangles.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; yes, this blog is a proud user of the european date format - if you don't want to see yyyy-mm-dd's, please press alt-f4 and go back to boycotting bud light or somethingInteresting to call this the "european date format", given that prior to ISO 8601 I'm pretty sure this date order was almost entirely used in East Asia and not Europe. To me day-month-year will always be the European date order.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've thought of this a lot!Lots of hospitality booking and pricing engines, for instance, require materialization of complex rules: if suppliers have rules that say "if the checkin is on these 3 days of each week add a price multiplier, which stacks with the holiday pricing event that happens every year, but only if you're a certain number of days out from check-in" you need to be able to render this for arbitrary date ranges to provide pricing calendars.And you can use simple iteration if you want to render for a single property - but what if you want to render a queried week's pricing across a massive corpus of units, where every millisecond of latency is a lost conversion opportunity? And where any supplier could change their rules at any time? And where length-of-stay and per-guest pricing might come into play, adding more dimensions that make full materialization hard to do?(Google, for instance, has something akin to this problem, in how it integrates with hotel suppliers using https://developers.google.com/hotels/hotel-prices/dev-guide/... .)You might even think, in this context: how can I represent the rules on a GPU or other system with limited working memory, and be able to render search results the way I'd render tiles?Then things like the OP's post become vital considerations, and far from just simple analogies!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, thanks for this mental model; I've got a project with iCals where I haven't been happy with the logic, and maybe I can clean it up with this! But I don't think the text matches the examples...This seems like an error?&gt; (day-of-month 12 2018-01-14) = 2018-02-14
&gt; // 2018-01-12 is the closest 12th day of month starting from 2018-01-14 (-2d),
&gt; // but that corresponds to a negative span, so we jump to the next monthShouldn't the nearest 12th day of the month after the 14th of January be 2018-02-12 ?&gt; Rule::DayOfMonth(31)
&gt;    .next(date("2018-02-14"))&gt; ... will say 2018-03-03 - which is legal, because the actual next occurrence happens on 2018-03-31, for which 2018-03-03 is a valid underapproximation.But I would expect curr.last_of_month().tomorrow().unwrap(), to return 2018-03-01 ???&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43704364</guid></item><item><title>23.

They differ from towns and suburbs  in basic ways,  and one of them is that cities are, by  definition, full  of strangers."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jane Jacobs's grandmother, Hannah Breece, was also a remarkable, dynamic woman: the first American schoolteacher in Alaska after its purchase from Russia. Jacobs did valuable work editing her grandmother's incomplete memoirs and publishing them with commentary [1]. If you are interested in Jacobs, give it a read; both women's personalities come through quite distinctly.[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1471846.A_Schoolteacher_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice measured perspective / retrospective on the long-term impact of two of Urban Planning's big cornerstone books.

My mom worked at the post office.Cheap postage hack: Nearly all U.S. stamps issued since World War II don’t have value. You can buy old stamps on eBay for about 60–75 % of face value as “face” stamps—and they’re perfectly valid for mailing.Unconventional postcards: A thin sheet of plywood with a Sharpie address label is a fun postcard. (it just costs a lot more than a normal postcard)Small Flat Rate Box physics: With a 70 lb limit, you’d need something exotic—say, a primordial black hole—to exceed the weight cap.Spare the carrier’s back: A Medium Flat Rate Box packed with  10,000 pre 1982 copper pennies tips the scale at roughly 68 lb. Maybe ship the coins another way—your postal carrier will thank you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a childhood trip, to visit family in sunny Hawaii, we mailed back this coconut from the family yard, by writing our rainy Portland address on the coconut in Sharpie.(The coconut was one of the large, oblong ones, with a smooth surface.  Not the small, spherical things in the grocery store.  So there was plenty of room for a legible address.)When we got home, we planted it in a large indoor planter, hanged a lamp over it, and grew a sizable palm tree in our living room.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand how there can be 94 comments on this thread and not one of them is from someone who attempted (or succeeded) in mailing someone a potato. I am a homeowner. I have a address. I will receive a potato, or send one to whomever wants one. What's important about this story is "is is true?".

&lt;p&gt;The article compares push and pull query engines in the context of data retrieval. Push query engines actively send data to users based on pre-defined criteria, while pull query engines necessitate users to request data on demand. The discussion highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, with push engines offering timely updates and reducing manual queries, whereas pull engines provide greater control and flexibility for users. The author emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific use cases and user needs in data management and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678533"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Polars I developed a new query engine which uses a hybrid of push and pull. I gave a short (and not very technical) talk about the engine at our first meetup recently, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndil-eLynh4.Each operator is a (set of) async functions which are connected to its input(s) and output(s) through capacity-1 spsc async channels. An operator pulls input by reading from a channel, and pushes output by writing into a channel. For an oversimplified example, consider a simple select operator:    while let Ok(morsel) = input.recv().await {
        let result = select(morsel);
        if output.send(result).await.is_err() {
            break;
        }
    }

Note how it has two await points: on receive and send.
The nice part about this is that Rust will automatically transform these asynchronous functions to state machines which can pause execution when either a send or receive blocks, returning control to our scheduler. In the above example the operator is able to pause both to wait for more data, or to wait until the receiver is able to consume more data. This also makes for example pausing execution in the middle of a hash join probe to send some partial results onwards in the computational graph trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In a setting where every operator has exactly one output, when to run an operator to produce some output is obvious: when your consumer needs it. This becomes, at the very least, messier with multiple outputs, since “requests for rows” and “computations to produce rows” are no longer one-to-one.Don't push-based systems have the same issue for inputs? If you have multiple inputs then you may be handled one of the inputs without the other. The classic example with iterators is a `zip` operator, though maybe this is probably not so common in database queries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's pretty easy in a push based model to let the 'pusher' know that no more data is required.  It's just like unsubscribing from an event, or returning a 'no more' status from the callback.  The push model does feel more natural to me, but perhaps that comes from familiarity with linux piping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678533</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In testing the metal after treatment, the research team found it boosted its strength by a factor of 2.6 while also cutting strain due to ratcheting by two to four orders of magnitude compared to untreated stainless steel. Such improvements, the team claims, could allow products made using the metal to be up to 10,000 times more resistant to fatigue.LOL; that second sentence mainly just explains that four orders of magnitude means 10,000.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish someone like Columbus/Reynolds/Tange could catch on this. It'd be awesome a road bike made of fancy/extra durable stainless steel tubing, lugged, horizontal top tube and that classic geometry but with disc brakes and thru axles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The new technique involved repeatedly twisting a sample of 304 austenitic stainless steel in a machine in certain ways. This led to spatially grading the cells that made up the metal, resulting in the build-up of what the team describes as a submicron-scale, three-dimensional, anti-crash wall.Interesting. Not a metallurgist but this takes advantage of stainless steels natural tendency to work harden. e.g. if you have ever broken a paperclip or other piece of steel by bending it back and forth until it fatigues, fractures, and beaks off. That happens in soft standard steels like A36 (edit forgot to finish this...) However, in stainless steel instead of a fracture forming at the bends crease, it hardens. As you try to bend it again, it bends in a new place as the original crease has hardened.&gt; Such improvements, the team claims, could allow products made using the metal to be up to 10,000 times more resistant to fatigue.Very bold claim that if true is a game changer. My concern is how does this process scale to large complex structural pieces? Assuming since this internal structure will be ruined by annealing it must be performed after final shaping of the material. Welding should not be effected, especially low heat effect zone processes like laser and electron beam as you account for material alteration from welding during design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43717377</guid></item><item><title>27.

There is a tremendous amount of training that you can do to basically change your conscious thoughts in an instant. Going from 180bpm heart rate and anxious panic to a static breath hold for up to a minute while being ragdolled and disoriented, is basically ego death. If you watch some gnarly big wave surfers talk about breathwork, they talk about rapidly flushing out your air in 3-4 big breaths, calming your heart rate, and even laughing, all right before or in anticipation of a pounding. Plus the whole Gerry Lopez yoga and meditation era of the 70s made it clear how important breathing and mental state were.In any case, this is something every single surfer beyond a certain level is required to master, so I'd love to see data from that kind of cohort. The old lady freedivers of Jeju Island would be cool too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had this described to me as basically the combination of neuro+psychological effects of hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis) in a peaceful/positive environment (as opposed to anxiety-attack-driven or etc.), plus the meditative effects of deep breathing, plus the meditative/brain-entrainment effects of rhythmic movement of a major central/core muscle (diaphragm). Together, those often cause euphoria, altered states of consciousness, and cognitive shifts not too far off from psychedelics.Could someone who is more familiar with it affirm, adjust, or deny that as a general (medically-grounded/secular) summary of breathwork?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i am a (former) neuroscientist and breathwork facilitator (mostly conscious connected breath) — AMA.the effect of decreased co2 concentration on vasoconstrictions (and also alkalosis-induced tetany, ie your muscles cramping, which happens a lot during breathwork) are well known [1], but i've never seen them quantified in such a clear way. It's cool to see mainstream science give it a closer look![1] for anyone interested, I wrote an explainer here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RuDv_E9osM1CCFWZMywMru9J...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695093</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A beautifully-written and moving story; thanks for posting it. Have you written any other fiction? I couldn't see it (or even this one) in the list of writing on your frontpage.Wholeheartedly approve your reading list, by the way. O Caledonia in particular is an under-recognized gem; I've never seen anyone else capture the awesomeness of squirrels the way she does:&gt; Calm and tranced she walked up through the beeches again and saw two red squirrels leaping along their sinuous branches; they leapt and curvetted, stopped dead, flourished their tails and were off again, swift and smooth, fleeting like light up the trunks, so bright and merry and joyous that she wanted to shriek with delight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your story does a great job at highlighting the small but profound every-day experiences of working in a lab with living beings as test subjects. It's hard to put into words the strength of wonder you can acquire for life working as a scientist or animal handler -- you have immense depth of understanding of the microscopic scale biology while simultaneously seeing it at work in real time in the whole animal (or society of animals) on the macro scale. It's the biology equivalent to the "pale blue dot" sentiment.The only similar deep, profound awe at life I've had outside of the lab was when my son was born. This might be the most common way people achieve this state of being. In all honesty this was one of the best parts of lab work. For me it happened every day; you're reminded of the insane complexity and the high degree of frailty of life. The terribly large power difference between yourself and a small animal in your hand. The deep similarities between humans and other animals, and at the same time, the worlds of difference. For me these experiences in the lab day after day put many other things in life on a lower rung, for better or for worse (like sustaining grad student pay and living conditions perhaps). But I wouldn't trade having that experience for anything.Your story hints at this beautifully, and I hope others get the chance to feel that feeling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vivarium workers are so important. And yeah, both they and a lot of students suffer a lot of grief rooted in a necessary but empathetically hard part of their job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43710761</guid></item><item><title>30. “Most promising signs yet” of alien life on a planet beyond our Solar System</title><link>https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/k2-18b-dimethyl-sulfide</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18b, which is located in the habitable zone of its star. This finding is significant as DMS is commonly associated with biological processes on Earth, potentially suggesting the presence of life on K2-18b. The piece highlights the importance of this discovery in the context of astrobiology and the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, emphasizing the need for further studies to understand the implications of DMS in alien atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the primary sourcehttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adc1c8They possibly detected dimethyl sulfide, which is only known to be produced by living organisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly that is completely badass science. The idea that you can use observations to detect the chemical composition of an exoplanet millions of kilometres away is an absolute triumph of the work of thousands of people over hundreds of years. Really amazing and deeply humbling to me.Secondly, my prior was always that life existed outside of earth. It just seems so unlikely that we are somehow that special. If life developed here I always felt it overwhelmingly likely that it developed elsewhere too given how incredibly unfathomably vast the universe is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some speculationOn DMS:- DMS is a very specific configuration that’s rarely the endpoint of non-living chemical cycles.- The simplicity of DMS doesn’t make it less indicative of life—it actually makes it a very selective molecule, which only shows up in large quantities when life is involved (at least in Earth-like chemistry).- Until we find a compelling abiotic pathway, high DMS remains a strong biosignature, especially in the context of a planet with a potential ocean and mild temperaturesPossible origins:We’re looking at some form of life that can:- Thrive in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere- Possibly live in or on top of a global ocean- Generate large amounts of DMS—potentially thousands of times more than EarthThe closest Earth analogy is:- Marine phytoplankton, particularly species like Emiliania huxleyi, produce DMS as a byproduct of breaking down DMSP, a molecule they use to regulate osmotic pressure and protect against oxidative stress.- If something similar is happening on K2-18 b, we’d be talking about an ocean teeming with such microbes—perhaps far denser than Earth’s oceans.Possibly "Giant photosynthetic mats" or sulfuric "algae"If there’s some landmass or floating structures, maybe the DMS producers are:- Photosynthetic, sulfur-metabolizing analogues to cyanobacteria- Living in dense floating colonies or mats like microbial reefs- Using dimethylated sulfur compounds in their metabolism, and leaking DMS as waste or signaling molecules===========Of course there have been lots of ocean planets in sci-fi literature, but I'm most reminded of the "Pattern Juggler" Planet Ararat from Alastair Reynolds' "Revelation Space" series.This is incredibly exciting news!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714203</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since GPG and openssh support the TPM for some operations, I am tempted to store secrets in the TPM instead; I think a hardware safe is better than messing with persistent envars and having to pay attention to children etc.But I am very nervous about doing so, since I have heard bad things about the reliability of the TPM (limited writes or something?) and locking myself out of important places.  Any people with experience using the TPM for secrets in Linux?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless you're good at actually maintaining your gpg keychain and need other people to access this, I really wouldn't bother with gpg. There are way better and simpler options.Age has a simpler interface and SSH key support https://github.com/FiloSottile/ageejson2env has the environment variable integration and ejson has multiple backends https://github.com/Shopify/ejson2envdirenv can support any cli secrets manager per project directory https://direnv.net/I've dealt with enough "why did this break" situations with gpg secrets files used by capable teams that I'd never recommend that to anyone. And unless you really need the public key support (teams and deployment support), you're unlikely to gain anything better over a password manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more general version of this is probably sops[1].(A general problem with these kinds of “wrap GPG” tools is that you end up with “mystery meat” encryption/signatures: your tool’s security margin is at the mercy of GPG’s opaque and historically not very good defaults.)[1]: https://github.com/getsops/sops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43721228</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday technology and its implications for society. It argues that AI should be viewed as a normal technological advancement rather than a disruptive force. The piece highlights the need for thoughtful governance and ethical considerations as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in various aspects of life, including its potential to impact jobs, privacy, and decision-making processes. Ultimately, it calls for a collaborative approach to ensure that AI development aligns with public values and fosters societal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43697717"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a rare piece on AI which takes a coherent middle of the road viewpoint. Saying both that AI is “normal” and that it will be transformative is a radical statement in today’s discussions about AI.Looking back on other normal but transformative technologies: steam power, electricity, nuclear physics, the transistor, etc you do actually see similarly stratified opinions. Most of those are surrounded by an initial burst of enthusiasm and pessimism and follow a hype cycle.The reason this piece is compelling is because during the initial hype phase taking a nuanced middle of the road viewpoint is difficult. Maybe AI really is some “next step” but it is significantly more likely that belief is propped up by science fiction and it’s important to keep expectations inline historically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burning the planet for a ponzi scheme isn't normal.The healthiest thing for /actual/ AI to develop is for the current addiction to LLMs to die off. For the current bets by OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc to lose steam. Prompts are a distraction, and every single company trying to commodify this are facing an impossible problem in /paying for the electricity/. Currently they're just insisting on building more power plants, more datacenters, which is like trying to do more compute with vacuum relays. They're digging in the wrong place for breakthroughs, and all the current ventures will go bust and be losses for investors. If they start doing computation with photons or something like that, then call me back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The statement “AI is normal technology” is three things: a description of current AI, a prediction about the foreseeable future of AI, and a prescription about how we should treat it.A question for the author(s), at least one of whom is participating in the discussion (thanks!): Why try to lump together description, prediction, and prescription under the "normal" adjective?Discussing AI is fraught. My claim: conflating those three under the "normal" label seems likely to backfire and lead to unnecessary confusion. Why not instead keep these separate?My main objection is this: it locks in a narrative that tries to neatly fuse description, prediction, and prescription. I recoil at this; it feels like an unnecessary coupling. Better to remain fluid and not lock in a narrative. The field is changing so fast, making description by itself very challenging. Predictions should update on new information, including how we frame the problem and our evolving values.A little bit about my POV in case it gives useful context: I've found the authors (Narayanan and Kapoor) to be quite level-headed and sane w.r.t. AI discussions, unlike many others. I'll mention Gary Marcus as one counterexample; I find it hard to pin Marcus down on the actual form of his arguments or concrete predictions. His pieces often feel like rants without a clear underlying logical backbone (at least in the year or so I've read his work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43697717</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses automatic differentiation (autodiff), a computational technique used to evaluate the derivative of functions efficiently and accurately. It provides an overview of the principles behind autodiff, its applications in machine learning and optimization, and compares it to numerical differentiation and symbolic differentiation. The site includes practical examples of implementing autodiff in various programming contexts, highlighting its advantages in terms of performance and precision. Overall, it serves as a resource for understanding and applying automatic differentiation in computational tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Historical fact: Differentiable programming was a little known secret back in the 90's, used mainly by engineers simulating numerically stiff systems like nukes and   chemicals in FORTRAN 95.  It then disappeared for nearly 30 yrs before rediscovery by the ML/AI researchers!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, finite differences have a big problem: they only compute the derivative of f in one direction. If our input is very high dimensional, computing the full gradient of f becomes computationally infeasible, as we would have to evaluate f for each dimension separately.And it is terribly unstable numerically. f(x) and f(x+h) are very similar, h is very small. You have to expect destructive cancellation to happen. For black boxes it is the only real alternative though, you can do a bit better by taking a derivative in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Now that we understand differentiation, let’s move on to programming. So far, we’ve only considered mathematical functions, but we can easily translate our perspective to programs. For simplicity, we’ll only consider pure functions, i.e. functions whose output depends solely on 
its parameters (no state)."I think I've seen this notion that the constraint is pureness also in documentation of autodiff libraries, but this cannot be strong enough, right?It easy enough to come up with functions that are nowhere differentiable. So my question is, what are the actual requirements a state of the art autodiff library has for the input function and why do people focus on the pureness aspect if that is probably the least of the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713140</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the author's personal journey and insights following a stroke, emphasizing the profound impact of this life-altering event. It reflects on the struggles of recovery, the changes in perception of life and health, and the importance of resilience and support from loved ones.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had gone blind in my right eye. There was one person standing before me at the reception in the emergency room arguing with the receptionist because he did not have health insurance (before the ACA). I remember thinking about a post card I saw in Powell's Books on Hawthorn St. in Portland Oregon out of the corner of my eye years earlier that said (paraphrasing) "Be thankful for our enemies, for they give us the opportunity to learn patience and understanding -- The Buddha." (The Buddha never said that.) While waiting I thought this was a good opportunity for me to learn patience and remain calm letting the man finish. That was a good thought because I was suffering from a stroke and if I had not been calm likely I wouldn't have survived. Turns out, every prior moment I had learned patience and understanding was for that one single moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a mini stroke that was classed as a TIA at the time, though it later turned out to have some lasting effects. It's a fascinating and overwhelming experience to unlearn reading.To me, the immediate physical aspect was that all text started to look like Star Wars languages. Another aspect was that it was difficult to even concentrate on the text. It no longer stood out from the environment. It was an irrelevant detail, a decoration you wouldn't pay particular attention to.I can also appreciate what the author is saying about how their perspective of the world shifted. I expect that her shift was a lot larger than mine, but mine already made me appreciate that in the modern world, when we look at things, we often seek to retrieve some bit of information. We don't look at them holistically. Our tunnel vision is tremendous.As you are reading this comment, you are so focused on the words that you don't see the boxy proportions of the rectangular screen you're looking at. You don't see the contrast on the screen; you're not even paying attention to the colors, likely. The texture of your display is expected to be different on the back, the corners, and its surface. Your display is also a rectangular light, casting a shadow of your head behind you now. Some parts of the light are stronger than others; it's not a uniform light. The device you're reading this on (whether a monitor or a phone) has hot spots and cold spots on its chassis that you may not have thought about, despite looking at it or touching it for thousands of hours.But if you can't read, you see all these things on a computer monitor, on a TV, on a road sign, on a book, and that's all that your brain finds significant about that object. That's quite interesting - how our language abilities shape our everyday perception of reality.I would even say that it can be an enlightening experience to take a holiday from reading. Though I don't think anyone can come close to enjoying it, considering how much anxiety the thought of whether they'll learn it again causes. In some ways, experiencing the world around them freshly anew, without that anxiety (as the author has), is a blissful and beautiful experience few people have had in their lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a minor stroke a couple of months ago - scans show two holes in my brain, one was in my right arm's motor control (I realised what was happening when I kept missing the keys on my laptop) which came right within hours. The other is a mystery, it's hard to think of things that are gone, I'm hoping it was something I don't need anymore from a long time ago like COBOL or Fortran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43685072</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Image Generation with Adaptive Normalization" presents a novel approach to image generation that leverages adaptive normalization techniques. The authors propose a framework that adjusts normalization parameters in response to different styles and content in images, enhancing the diversity and quality of generated visual outputs. The method is shown to outperform existing image generation models, particularly in terms of style transfer and consistency. Key contributions include a detailed analysis of adaptive normalization effects and extensive experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach in various scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques the commonly cited example of the Halting Problem in discussions about NP-completeness, arguing that it is not a suitable analogy for understanding NP problems. The author explains that the Halting Problem is undecidable and does not fit into the framework of decision problems typically discussed in NP contexts. By clarifying the distinctions between different types of computational problems, the piece emphasizes the importance of using more relevant examples to illuminate the complexities of NP problems and their implications in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Most "definitely harder than NP" problems require a nontrivial background in theoretical computer science or mathematics to understand.One of the simplest examples of this is automatic program synthesis.Searching for the optimal (e.g., shortest) program that satisfies a given set of inputs/outputs (function) is an undecidable (worse than exponential time) problem similar to the halting problem. The exponent in this case would have been the size of the instruction set, but we still don't know how many cycles we need (i.e., is it even practical to run?).In applications like genetic programming, we deal with the halting problem by specifying a maximum # of cycles that the program interpreter will run for each time. The ability of the synthesized programs to halt in a bounded time becomes part of selection pressure. Candidates that return poor or no results within the constraints are quickly eliminated. This can be further compounded by making the candidates evolve their own resource limits as part of their genome.Put differently, we can approximately solve the halting problem for some smaller problems with clever search techniques. I don't think talking about these things in absolute terms is very useful. Everything depends on the problem and the customer's expectations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example given doesn't seem right to me.&gt; There is one problem, though, that I find easily explainable. Place a token at the bottom left corner of a grid that extends infinitely up and right, call that point (0, 0). You're given list of valid displacement moves for the token, like (+1, +0), (-20, +13), (-5, -6), etc, and a target point like (700, 1). You may make any sequence of moves in any order, as long as no move ever puts the token off the grid. Does any sequence of moves bring you to the target?If someone gives you such a sequence, it seems trivial to verify it in linear time. Even for arbitrary dimensions, and such witness can be verified in linear time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I find fascinating is that we know that P != EXPTIME, and that P &lt;= NP &lt;= EXPTIME, but have managed to prove neither P != NP nor NP != EXPTIME. NP has to be somewhere between them but we have no idea where.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714041</guid></item><item><title>37.

It was definitely the go to place for computer building blocks and related supplies.It was amazing what could be found there. One really great thing was relay racks and all kinds of shelves and attachments for them. Too good to pass up I bought one. It was used in my office (for webserver and LAN) and still houses my home server.Like everywhere else Fry's closed unceremoniously. I guess the chain couldn't withstand the growing online competition and waning interest in desktop machines.

Their flavours were so elevated compared to the usual counterparts that I get from supermarkets, that I questioned whether any artificial addititives were used - obviously not.

&lt;p&gt;The document provides an introduction to the Bash shell, covering its features, basic commands, and usage for shell scripting. It emphasizes the importance of command-line interfaces and demonstrates various commands for file management, process handling, and variable manipulation. The presentation is aimed at helping users become proficient in navigating and utilizing the Bash environment effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on a longish search for a bash replacement (or at least "extra substitute") in the realm of "more complex commandline scripting" (functions, utility scripts, etc.). Naturally, every option is a set of different compromises.I think I've finally settled on Lua- It's small, coherent, surprisingly fast (especially with LuaJIT) and has the "virtually no startup cost" I was looking for (which ruled out, for example, Elixir for a lot of things).And, I've finally figured out how to bang my nix-darwin flake.nix config in a way that gets it AND a bunch of popular libraries installed together and all seeing each other.Wondering what others have found to address this. Or if they just stuck with Bash, since it's just not going away anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mark of an advanced shell scripter is knowing not to do advanced shell scripting.(This statement primarily applies to existing stringly-typed scripting languages, which are nightmarish to maintain and debug. PowerShell, nushell, or similar solutions have a much higher complexity ceiling.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New readers might enjoy the tale of Emperor Sh and the Traveller:

They may not always be the best solution but a fantastic baseline that can be deployed and adapted to a usecase in less than an hour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The moment I started reading this, I got reminded of this recent study: https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10212v1The scope is a bit different. The study uses an LLM to interpret pose estimation data and describe the behavior in each frame. The output is text which can be used to create embeddings of behavior. As someone who works in ethology, that's a clever (but maybe expensive) idea.I think the author could use something similar. With multi-person pose estimation models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better title: "LLM OCR on Rugby screenshots to read score and clock"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714902</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very long time ago when I was at Sun we struggled with this. Sun added something called the 'translucent file system' among other things. There was briefly a thought of changing stat so that it would report "data" being held by the file (all of the things written to it), "extents" of the file (all of the blocks it was taking up on disk), and "size" which accounted for partial blocks and was backwards compatible, and "flags" which included "encrypted" (yes/no), "sparse" (yes/no), "fixed" (yes/no), and at least one and possibly others that I can't remember. It served to illustrate how complex the question of file systems had become beyond the original "SAM" and "ISAM" methods from mainframes. It was either Guy Harris or Jon Livesey who pointed out that checking a damaged version of a file system with all of those capabilities as first class attributes was probably not NP complete. :-).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;However, it does leave us with no way of finding out the logical block size, which we may care about for various reasonsThere's SEEK_HOLE and fiemap ioctl.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many years ago I looked after a Novell cluster of three hosts with a rather expensive FC connected array.  So what - that's pretty normal?It was the early noughties and a TB was expensive.  I wrote a spreadsheet with inputs from the Novell .ocx jobbies.  The files were stored on some Novell NSS volu.mes.I was able to show all states of the files and aggregate stats too.Nowadays a disc is massive and worrying about compression is daft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679764</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I am curious about is why the need for crates? Did they try modules or was the initial compiler using them??Edit: grammar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Given that we now fully utilize 128 threads or 64 cores for pretty much the entire compile time, we can do a back of the envelope calculation for how long it should take: 25 min / 128 = 12 sec (or maybe 24 sec since hyper-threads aren't real cores). Yet it takes 170s to compile everything.Amdahl’s Law would like to have a word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eminently pragmatic solution — I like it. In Rust, a crate is a compilation unit, and the compiler has limited parallelism opportunities, especially since rustc offloads much of the work to LLVM, which is largely single-threaded.It’s not surprising they didn’t see a linear speedup from splitting into so many crates. The compiler now produces a large number of intermediate object files that must be read back and linked into the final binary. On top of that, rustc caches a significant amount of semantic information — lifetimes, trait resolutions, type inference — much of which now has to be recomputed for each crate, including dependencies. That introduces a lot of redundant work.I also would expect this to hurt runtime performance as it likely reduces inlining opportunities (unless LTO is really good now?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715235</guid></item><item><title>45.

If your agent is trained to match a profile of a radical, then it necessarily is spreading and encouraging that radical messaging in order to fit in and gain trust. At least with real agents there is a plausible mechanism for their judgement to filter out who is targeted and they can't infinitely propagate like the AI could.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what happens when bots find other suspects are bots ... deploy more bots?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;RL doesn't completely "work" yet, it still has a scalability problem. Claude can write a small project, but as it becomes larger, Claude gets confused and starts making mistakes.I used to think the problem was that models can't learn over time like humans, but maybe that can be worked around. Today's models have large enough context windows to fit a medium sized project's complete code and documentation, and tomorrow's may be larger; good-enough world knowledge can be maintained by re-training every few months. The real problem is that even models with large context windows struggle with complexity moreso than humans; they miss crucial details, then become very confused when trying to correct their mistakes and/or miss other crucial details (whereas humans sometimes miss crucial details, but are usually able to spot them and fix them without breaking something else).Reliability is another issue, but I think it's related to scalability: an LLM that cannot make reliable inferences from a small input data, cannot grow that into a larger output data without introducing cascading hallucinations.EDIT: creative control is also superseded by reliability and scalability. You can generate any image imaginable with a reliable diffusion model, by first generating something vague, then repeatedly refining it (specifying which details to change and which to keep), each refinement closer to what you're imagining. Except even GPT-4o isn't nearly reliable enough for this technique, because while it can handle a couple refinements, it too starts losing details (changing unrelated things).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who are knowledgeable about the field but not yet the author of this post, it is worth mentioning that Shunyu Yao has played a huge role in the development of LLM-based AI agents, including being an author / contributor to:- ReAct- Reflexion- SWE-bench- OpenAI Deep Research- OpenAI Operator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; AI has beat world champions at chess and Go, surpassed most humans on SAT and bar exams, and reached gold medal level on IOI and IMO. But the world hasn’t changed much, at least judged by economics and GDP.&gt; I call this the utility problem, and deem it the most important problem for AI.&gt; Perhaps we will solve the utility problem pretty soon, perhaps not. Either way, the root cause of this problem might be deceptively simple: our evaluation setups are different from real-world setups in many basic ways.LLMs are reaching the same stage that most exciting technologies reach. They have quickly attracted lots of investor money, but that is going to have to start turning into actual money. Many research papers are being written, but people are going to start wanting to see actual improvements, not just theoretical improvements on benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679065</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might as well be 10 - 1000 years. Reality is no one knows how long it'll take to get to AGI, because:1) No one knows what exactly makes humans "intelligent" and therefore
2) No one knows what it would take to achieve AGIGo back through history and AI / AGI has been a couple of decades away for several decades now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My pet peeve: talking about AGI without defining it. There’s no consistent, universally accepted definition. Without that, the discussion may be intellectually entertaining—but ultimately moot.And we run into the motte-and-bailey fallacy: at one moment, AGI refers to something known to be mathematically impossible (e.g., due to the No Free Lunch theorem); the next, it’s something we already have with GPT-4 (which, while clearly not superintelligent, is general enough to approach novel problems beyond simple image classification).There are two reasonable approaches in such cases. One is to clearly define what we mean by the term. The second (IMHO, much more fruitful) is to taboo your words (https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your...)—that is, avoid vague terms like AGI (or even AI!) and instead use something more concrete. For example: “When will it outperform 90% of software engineers at writing code?” or “When will all AI development be in hands on AI?”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is AGI even important? I believe the next 10 to 15 years will be Assisted Intelligence. There are things that current LLM are so poor I dont believe a 100x increase in pref / watt is going to make much difference. But it is going to be good enough there wont be an AI Winter. Since current AI has already reached escape velocity and actually increase productivity in many areas.The most intriguing part is if Humanoid factory worker programming will be made 1000 to 10,000x more cost effective with LLM. Effectively ending all human production. I know this is a sensitive topic but I dont think we are far off. And I often wonder if this is what the current administration has in sight. ( Likely Not )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43719280</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started using this pattern years ago and haven't looked back. React components are defined using a single properties param and it feels natural to extend the practice to other methods and helper functions that I write.One nice unexpected side effect is that I end up with more consistency in variable naming when using a param object in order to benefit from object definition shortcuts.ie I will usually write something like  const firstName = getFirstName(); doTheThing({ firstName });

rather than  const fName = getFirstName(); doTheThing({ firstName: fName });&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not an expert in JS, but maybe this makes sense in JS where everything is passed as objects anyway and having a single param is often more readable there.But in native languages like C/C++/etc, this pattern usually hurts performance. Separate arguments go into registers (faster but depends on number of arguments), while structs often involve indirection, and sometimes alignment/padding issues. Also, passing a const struct doesn’t guarantee the fields inside are truly const.That said, it's context dependent. If you're passing stuff through multiple layers or want a more stable function signature, using a struct can be cleaner. Just not something I’d generalize to any language or any use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other advantage to this pattern is that you can create a generic interface out of this.With the N-params pattern it is not possible to create an interface on this method because the types of each param may be different across different implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43720457</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a trigonometric math library in the programming language Nix, starting from scratch. It outlines the fundamental concepts of trigonometry and demonstrates how to implement various functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent. The tutorial emphasizes practical coding strategies, providing code snippets and explanations to help readers understand the implementation process. By the end, readers should have a functional trigonometric library that can be utilized in their Nix projects, fostering a deeper understanding of both mathematical concepts and programming in Nix.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have gone with an interesting licensing solution here. I really appreciate that it is labeled as a source-available license instead of Open Source.https://defold.com/license/You can make proprietary changes to the engine without releasing them (unlike GPL). You can freely monetize games built with the engine, and they make some assurances that there won't be a bait-and-switch.And finally, the reason why this is not Apache 2.0- you cannot monetize (forks of) the game engine itself.This seems fair and carefully considered. Kudos to the team!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major props to them for not only calling it "source available" (and not trying to misuse "open source" like so many do), but also for highlighting the additions to their Apache-based license: https://defold.com/license/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a soft spot for defold, partly because they're unique in the gamedev space. For example, the GUI editor that is built-in is done in Clojure! https://github.com/defold/defold/tree/dev/editor (cljfx for the GUI, I am rooting for seesaw though :))From what I understand it emerged from a gamedev studio from Sweden (King or something?) so there's commercial release pedigree there. I believe their console platform build/release tooling does cost money for game devs because the platform SDKs themselves impose restrictions. But I get the impression that defold as org does seem to put in earnest effort to be fair to game devs with licensing, etc. like others mentioned here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43726051</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sometimes pick up random projects just because I can, this was one of those times. I made it as a week long project a while back this year but never shared here, so thought to go for it haha.I created a game inspired by Doom and the backrooms called The Backdooms under 2.4kb in minified html. (for reference, this entire post would be around 1.8kB haha)
I had to use a not popular way of using GZip with Zlib headers (had to write my own script for compressing it, also in the repo) to eventually convert it a size 40 QR code that works right in your browser using Decompressionstream API.This is of course a very oversimplified description of it, using a lot of the same technologies that DOOM had but combining it with infinite seed based map generation in 2.4kb (QR codes can only store 3kb, which includes changing formats) was pretty hard.Here are some links about it if you want to nerd out and read more:Repository Link (MIT License): https://github.com/Kuberwastaken/backdoomsA Hosted (slightly improved) version of The Backdooms: https://kuberwastaken.github.io/backdooms/Game Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QWPr10cAuGcMy Linkedin post about it: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295667...(PS: You'd need something like https://qrscanner.org/ or something that can scan bigger QR codes and put the text data onto your browser to play it)My Blogs documenting the process and development in detail:https://kuberwastaken.github.io/blog/Projects/How-I-Managed-...
https://kuberwastaken.github.io/blog/Projects/How-I-Managed-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pardon my dumb query, as I'm a tech novice, but aren't QR just encodings of data? And the max amount of data a QR can encode is like 3kb, which would roughly correspond to 3000 or so plaintext characters. So the achievement here is that this Doom-like game can be run from an executable roughly of that size?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really cool project! TIL about 'data:' URLs—while I was familiar with the 'data:' URI scheme and had used it before, I didn’t realize it could be used as a full URL. Funny enough, I had been thinking about building something similar that fits entirely within a QR code, but I held off because I mistakenly thought it would require an HTTP(s) link. I was heavily inspired by this work: Can you fit a whole game into a QR code?(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExwqNreocpg)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729683</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article analyzes chord progressions in contemporary music, focusing on how different progressions contribute to the emotional aspects and overall sound of various songs. It explores common patterns found in popular music, examines the use of major and minor chords, and discusses the impact of these choices on listeners' experiences. The author aims to provide insight into songwriting techniques and the ways in which chord progressions shape the mood and appeal of music.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using absolute chord analysis instead of relative chords (i.e. roman numeral analysis) doesn't make sense. As others have noted, the original dataset is flawed because the structure of a song is critical, you cannot omit repeating chords. Programmers/analysts should take more care to understand music theory or the underlying field at hand, before compiling datasets or doing analysis."Most common chord" is mildly interesting, but not really that useful. The most common key, and the most commonly used chords relative to that key (i.e. with roman numeral analysis) would be much more useful and interesting. This would help paint a clearer distinction between e.g. country and jazz, not that "jazz uses Bb major more". Also, anyone with general instrument knowledge would surmise that since Bb and Eb instruments are much more prevalent."If you’re sitting down to write a song, throw a 7th chord in. The ghost of a jazz great will smile on you."7ths don't belong to jazz only, and the average songwriter isn't making data-driven decisions on how to settle on the chord structure for their song.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way this analysis, and the original dataset were created, makes no sense. This is, in part, not the author's fault, since the original data [1, 2] is flawed.First, the original data was constructed like this: "...The next step was to format the raw HTML files into the full chord progression of each song, collapsing repeating identical chords into a single chord (’A G G A’ became ’A G A’)..."Already this makes no sense - the fact that a chord is repeated isn't some sort of typo (though maybe it is on UltimateGuitar). For example, a blues might have a progression C7 F7 C7 C7 - the fact that C7 is repeated is part of the blues form. See song 225 from the dataset, which is a blues:A7 D7 A7 
D7 A7 
E7 D7 A7Should really be:A7 D7 A7 A7
D7 D7 A7 A7
E7 D7 A7 A7With these omissions, it's a lot harder to understand the underlying harmony of these songs.The second problem is that we don't really analyze songs so much by the chords themselves, but the relationships between chords. A next step would be to convert each song from chords to roman numerals so we can understand common patterns of how songs are constructed. Maybe a weekend project.[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22046
[2] https://huggingface.co/datasets/ailsntua/Chordonomicon/blob/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As others have said this is interesting but use of Ultimate Guitar is flawed as the tabs/scores are so bad on that site, very often not even being close to the real chords.On top of being simplified tons and tons of songs get rewritten with a Capo so people can just play G-C-D shapes, if your analysis doesn't look for "Capo" and then transpose all the chords then you end up overrepresenting the key of G and it's chords.   Then very often 7th chords, Sus chords, etc.. all get transcribed down to major chords &amp; minor chords due to the beginner focus.  Interestingly he doesn't include 6th chords as their own thing.To be fair there are tons of songs that do actually use those chords, so they may still end up coming out as the most popular.I have a grandfathered in lifetime membership to UG that I only had to pay once for.  It was cheap so worth it, but I really find the site kind of icky as they are mostly monetizing crowd sourced low quality work and it's very often wrong.   And they nerfed their iPad app recently which is really annoying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723020</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experiences and reflections on using Lua after completing a project that involved 60,000 lines of code. The author shares both positive aspects and challenges faced while working with Lua, highlighting its lightweight nature and flexibility, making it useful for game development and embedded systems. However, they also critique some of its limitations, such as the lack of built-in support for certain programming paradigms and debugging tools. Overall, the author provides an honest assessment of Lua, emphasizing its strengths for rapid development, while also acknowledging areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;With dynamically typed languages I feel it's better to wait until you've tried to maintain the code for a while before you consider the languages effectiveness.I had to maintain a very large Lua codebase that has been active for several years. One big problem with Lua was how it will happily take more or less parameters to functions and continue to execute compared to something like Python where it is an error to pass the wrong parameters. This meant when we update a function signature we would often incorrectly update call sites, etc.I can't remember the specifics but we had a few issues with tables being both dictionaries and lists. IIRC, if you delete a list index and there are later list indices, they will turn into dictionary keys. We had a few bugs to do with not traversing the entire array portion of a Lua table because of this.I also implemented a few classic algorithms, e.g. bisect in Lua and you have to be very careful with 1-based indices. You also have to be very careful when interfacing between C and Lua. I prefer 0-based indices and [start, stop) style ranges for everything nowadays.I much prefer statically typed code during maintenance. But dynamically typed languages like Python or Typescript where you can bolt on types, later if you wish, are not too bad.Also using named parameters as much as possible is great for maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This dev seems really inexperienced and has weird uninformed takes. The "functional vibe" but it's just using boolean logic, the "reference in a table" bugs that would happen in any language but C, the ignorance of type annotations and so much time spend on problems caused by said ignorance...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So much lua stuff on HN the past few days, I love it.Defold is a great engine. It has a somewhat steep learning curve (steeper than you'd expect, anyway) and its fair share of quirks, but more often than not the quirks are deliberate tradeoffs that steer you in the direction of structuring your game well. It really feels like an extension of the lua philosophy of giving you a narrow set slightly odd, but very robust and flexible tools that you build everything else out of.I'm back to using LOVE2D for general tinkering but a few months with Defold really changed how I approach things. I've been meaning to write up a post about it. Either way though, I'd highly recommend checking out Defold to anyone interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723088</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;A court ruling declared that the blanket search of cell tower data by law enforcement is unconstitutional, emphasizing the need for warrants and probable cause when accessing personal data from telecom companies. The decision highlights the importance of privacy rights and sets a precedent that could impact future cases involving digital surveillance and data collection practices. The ruling reflects growing concerns over how digital information is handled and reinforces the legal protections afforded to individuals against unwarranted government intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; U.S. District Juste Miranda M. Du rejected this argument, but wouldn’t suppress the evidence. “The Court finds that a tower dump is a search and the warrant law enforcement used to get it is a general warrant forbidden under the Fourth Amendment,” she said in a ruling filed on April 11. “That said, because the Court appears to be the first court within the Ninth Circuit to reach this conclusion and the good faith exception otherwise applies, the Court will not order any evidence suppressed.”It continues to amaze me that police are the only group who can use the defense of ignorance of the law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took me a while to track down the actual opinion.The case, United States v Spurlock, is 3:23-cr-00022 in the Nevada federal district.  The opinion itself is ECF document #370, and I have hosted a copy at https://plover.com/~mjd/misc/cell-tower-dump-opinion.pdf in case other people are interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that the recent ruling against blanket cell tower data searches wouldn't have affected the Mark Gooch case. In that insatnce, investigators used targeted cell phone data (ie "geofencing") to track his movements, not a mass data collection. Under the new standards, this type of focused surveillance would still be permitted.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBBTfy29WKIThey absolutely wouldn't have caught him without the cell phone data, highlighting in my mind, the fine line between privacy and safety, which is something I personally struggle to articulate clearly. While it's reassuring this ruling wouldn't affect this case, I can easily see how "tower dumps" could be misused. It's confusing, though, that the judge ruled this unconstitutional action permissible "just this once." Either it's unconstitutional or it's not. Judges shouldn't have the authority grant one-time exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43730545</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces a new API for handling ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data in Python, developed by Trail of Bits. It highlights the importance of ASN.1 in a variety of applications, including telecommunications and cryptography, and outlines the features of the new API, which aims to simplify the encoding and decoding of ASN.1 data structures. The author discusses the API's ease of use, performance improvements, and compatibility with existing libraries, encouraging developers to adopt the new tool for their projects related to ASN.1 data handling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small bit of historical context. When I was participating in the PKP meetings at RSADSI, I believe it was Ron who insisted that DER was the only reasonable choice if we were going to encode things with ASN.1 (which we were because both DEC and RSA had already insisted that it had to be OSI compatible or they wouldn't support it, my suggestion that we use Sun's XDR was soundly rebuked, but hey I had to offer)Generally it was presumed that because these were 'handshake' type steps (which is to say the prelude to establishing a cryptographic context for what would happen next) performance wasn't as important as determinism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is also rasn library for Rust that now supports most of the codecs (BER/CER/DER/PER/APER/OER/COER/JER/XER).Disclaimer: I have contributed a lot recently. OER codec (modern flair of ASN.1) is very optimized (almost as much as it can be with safe Rust and without CPU specific stuff). I am still working with benchmarking results, which I plan to share in close future. But it starts to be the fastest there is in open-source world. It is also faster than Google's Protobuf libraries or any Protobuf library in Rust. (naive comparison, no reflection support). Hopefully other codecs could be optimized too.[1] https://github.com/librasn/rasn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related: if you ever want to create your own serialization format, please at least have a cursory look at the basics of ASN.1. It's very complete both in terms of textual descriptions (how it started) and breadth of encoding rules (because it's practical.)(You can skip the classes and macros, though they are indeed cool...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43728279</guid></item><item><title>7.

My relationship with them as a customer feels refreshingly transparent; I can't think of any other consumer SaaS provider that automatically answers my reflexive "how does this make money?" question.(Compare, say, Discord. It's best in class, but eternally unprofitable - which makes me wary that it might fold or go to hell at the drop of a hat.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the staff sees this - please stop preventing zoom. Not only is that bad for accessibility, it makes the article less useful for everyone - there's a screenshot included showing off the feature, but it's too small to read on the phone and I can't zoom in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kagi are one of my favorite companies. In a world where buying a T-shirt requires me to hand over my phone number ("in case we need to contact you about your order" - yeah, right) I find it so refreshing that kagi barely require any info from me except some form of payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43724941</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Objective-C is designed in such a way that, generally speaking, anything you can do with Objective-C syntax can also be done with a simple C function call to one of the Objective-C runtime functions. So you can write an entire iOS app in pure C. However, the Objective-C stuff is a lot more pleasant to use if you use the syntax for it.As others have mentioned, for something like a simple game (rather than a normal GUI application), SDL offers a convenient wrapper that allows you to avoid touching anything Objective-C-related yourself, so you could write an entire app using only the SDL API, which is pure C. A nice bonus of that approach is that it would then work on other platforms with zero code changes.Another source of C wrappers is Apple themselves, as iOS has a number of C interfaces like CoreFoundation that reduce how much Objective-C stuff you have to directly interact with, but there's nothing like that for UIKit, and every iOS app has to use UIKit at least a little.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes. And many are when you require a common code-base for iOS, Android, and other devices. (But C++ is used more commonly)Video games are the ones that do this by default. It would be close to impossible to have feature parity by coding a game for iOS in Swift, for Android in Java, for Steam in C++, etc. Unreal or Unity will have C/C++ code-bases with very light integration layers to do system calls.(The payment system may have code in Objective-C, for example, but mostly a wrapper for convenience reasons)The other extreme is to just use webapps in an electron wrapper. But electron itself is build in C++.My guess is that most developers are going to use the default Java/Swift combination for mobile development because that is what each company taught in their websites. I would prefer, thou, that engineers were more inclined to use opensource solutions to create common interfaces and avoid vendor lock-in. But cool events and free tutorials are hard to beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you just want to write C and are ok linking to stuff that is in other languages, then I used SDL2 for my game which I wrote in C and is on the app store. It was a very pleasant experience, and if I were doing an iOS thing again, I would likely do something similar.I think I had one objective C file in there for calling a library function I needed, but otherwise I just wrote C code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682984</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline of AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) for email, exploring its initial promise of enhancing email interactivity and performance. It examines the challenges and limitations that have hindered widespread adoption, such as complexity, lack of support from major email clients, and concerns over security. The author reflects on the evolution of email technologies and suggests that while AMP for email had potential, it ultimately failed to gain traction in the way its proponents had hoped. The piece offers insights into the future of email innovation and the importance of balancing functionality with user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me the most important objection is that an email is a record of something, and needs to be self-contained and immutable for that reason.When I get an email, I want to know that I can always come back to that exact email for reference, and that there's no way that it can have changed, or that the important information is externally referenced (and therefore also subject to change).I think this is one important reason that more and more emails are just links to some website with the information on it (often with a login required as well). It allows the company sending you the email to retain control of that information. If you email me a text or PDF invoice, I can always come back to it for my own reference. If you send me a link to one, there's no guarantee I can still access it later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I agree with this article's conclusion, I think it conflates political/market objections to AMP (i.e. abuse of monopoly power) with technical concerns.For a time, I tech-led the creation of the AMP site for a major news publisher. The technical choices of AMP, excluding the CDN-aspect, are I think a great fit for publishing websites with tens-hundreds of developers who are all tempted to write bespoke JS and in so doing create performance and maintenance hell. In many respects, philosophically, I think AMP was not far of HTMX. In AMP, developers are able to construct relatively sophisticated dynamic/interactive features using simple markup (and pre-built JS components). The page is managed through a single JS runtime which helps manage performance issues. As components have a standard HTML interface, it is possible to migrate the backend to different rendering technologies partially over time unlike (for example), isomorphic JS which forces a large-scale rewrite down the line.I tried to advocate for an in-house AMP-like solution for our main website, but it was ultimately re-written in React -- a process which took several years and resulted in a codebase of much greater complexity. (Performance was better than the old website but I'm not sure React really contributed to the gains here.)While AMP is rightly dead, I think the technical choices it made live on (or at least, they should).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email and SQL: two technologies that people keep saying are out of date and need replacing, but they keep rolling on whilst attempted replacements wither on the vine, with their dust eventually blowing away on the winds of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725865</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been getting into sailing, solely for the purpose of cruising and sailing for fun with no interest in racing.  As I've started talking to sailors, I've realized that you need to gauge whether you're speaking with a racer or a cruiser.  Racers will claim these are not mutually exclusive categories, because of course racers can also cruise.  But racers who cruise will ultimately talk to you like racers.Racers are, as you might expect, fanatical about performance.  They will go very deep into details about optimizing sail trim and shape, and using wildly-named specialized foresails (not merely spinnakers, but asymmetric spinnakers, reachers, screachers, code-zeroes, etc). It's a bit like talking to an SCCA racer about your new pickup truck.In fact, if you have a good grounding in the basics of sail trim ("when in doubt, let it out"), and know how to put a reef in you can have a fine time getting between points A and B in a sloop with a basic mainsail and jib.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This site is an absolute treasure trove of technical material on sail and hull design, with a focus on model yachts but most of the physics scales up. It covers aerofoil theory (momentum, circulation, lifting line), sail twist, downwash, planform effects, Reynolds number, hull resistance, appendage design, VMG, and more.Lots of spreadsheets and practical calculators too—bulb shape optimization, wetted surface area, simple VPP models. If you're into sail performance modeling or yacht design, this is one of the best resources out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arvel Gentry must be mentioned, he transferred much of the aerodynamics research to sailing with an amazing series of magazine articles. He debunked a lot of faulty theories, like how the slot works, in a meticulous but approachable style.http://gentrysailing.com/magazines.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43698522</guid></item><item><title>11. 15,000 lines of verified cryptography now in Python</title><link>https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2025/04/18/python.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the size distribution of internet packet transmissions, analyzing data from various Internet Service Providers (ISPs). It examines how packet sizes have evolved over time and highlights the significant increase in the prevalence of smaller packets. The findings suggest that the efficiency and performance of internet communication continue to improve, while also addressing challenges related to network congestion and performance. The author provides graphs and statistical insights to illustrate trends and implications for internet infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of one of the most interesting bugs I've faced: I was responsible for developing the component that provided away market data to the core trading system of a major US exchange (which allows the trading system to determine whether an order should be matched in-house or routed to another exchange with a better price).Throughputs were in the multiple tens of thousands of transactions per second and latencies were in single digit milliseconds (in later years these would drop to double digit microseconds, but that's a different story). Components were written in C++, running on Linux. The machine that ran my component and the trading engine were neighbors in a LAN.We put my component through a full battery of performance tests, and for a while, we seem to be meeting the numbers. Then one day, with absolutely zero code changes from my end or the trading engine's end, the the latency numbers collapsed. We checked the hardware configs and the rate at which the latest test was run. Both identical.It took, I think, several days to solve the mystery: in the latest test run, we had added one extra away market to a list of 7 or 8 markets for which my component provided market data to the trading system. We had added markets before without an issue. It's a negligible change to the market data message size, because it only adds a few bytes: market ID, best bid price &amp; quantity, best offer price &amp; quantity. In no way should such a small change result in a disproportionate collapse in the latency numbers. It took a while for us to realize that before the addition of these few bytes, our market data message (a binary packed format), neatly fit into a single ethernet frame. Those extra few bytes pushed it over the 1600 (or 1500?) mark and caused all market data message frames (which were the bulk of messages on the system, next to orders), to fragment. The frame fragmentation and reassembly overhead was enough to clog up the pipes at the rates we were pumping data.In the short run, I think we managed to do some tweaks and get the message back under 1600 bytes (by omitting markets that did not have a current bid/offer, rather than sending NULLs). I can't recall what we did in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MTU discovery would be so much easier if the default behavior was truncate and forward when encountering a oversized packet. The endpoints can then just compare the bytes received against the size encoded inside of the packet to trivially detect truncation and thus get the inbound MTU size.This allows you to do MTU discovery as a endpoint protocol with all the authentication benefits that provides and allows you to send a single large probe packet to precisely identify the MTU size. It would also allow you to immediately and transparently identify MTU reductions due to route changes or any other such cause instead of packets just randomly blackholing or getting responses from unknown, unauthenticated endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Path MTU discovery has not been enthusiastically embracedUgh.  I don't understand this.  Especially passive PMTUD should just be rolled out everywhere.  On Linux it still defaults to disabled!  https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context%3Aglobal+repo%3A%5E...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723884</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fascinating to have a glimpse into a parallel history of computing that happened in a small country without the resources to make it big, but with tireless efforts of brilliant mathematicians and engineers who made the advancements against the odds.If the history ran along a parallel path, I wonder what could have been different and what would have ended up exactly the same.For the PL nerds who are curious about Loglan, check out: 
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrzej-Salwicki/public...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this YouTube channel about the MERA-400, complete with interviews with its designer [0]. Unfortunately, it is all in Polish.[0] https://youtube.com/@mera400&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; as the inefficiency of the centralisation efforts meant that it was met with delays and a lack of coordination.Starting in 1981, I lived through the evolution of "personal computers" and have worked in the startup side of high tech most of my career. Even in the U.S. it was hard to create a successful, sustainable business in computing. I can't even imagine trying to do the same in the Eastern block with central planning, lack of ecosystem and myriad other challenges. Here in the U.S. there was a rueful saying in tech that "sometimes the better product doesn't win" but it was a saying because it was usually an exception. At least there was a general expectation that better products would win. It's kind of tragic how much engineering talent went to waste or was never utilized behind the iron curtain.A little over 20 years ago I visited Warsaw for a few days and, of course, sought out the technology museum. I think I may have been the only visitor while I was there. Every large hall had a dedicated guard sitting in a chair, who mostly looked like retired pensioners. I felt bad because I woke up a lot of nice people just walking quietly through. The museum was mostly focused on industrial, manufacturing and agricultural technology but there was quite an extensive computer hall and it was chock full of fascinating mainframe and mini-looking systems I'd never seen, even in pictures. I was surprised that, other than terminals, there was little in the way of desktop or home computers. Thinking about it I realized that circa 2000, Poland's early desktop and home computers were probably still in use and a few years away from museum fodder. The only bad part was there was virtually no info in English (at least back then) and no mobile phone translate apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43698327</guid></item><item><title>15.

  attune repo pkg -r 1 add -c stable/v17 ~/Downloads/teleport_17.4.4_arm64.deb

And I think I know what `-d bookworm` must be, but I've no clue what -r or -c are doing in the second command.Also, from your post here (and why are the quick start steps different here?),  attune repo create --uri https://apt.releases.example.com

What is that URI supposed to be? Is that where the thing will eventually get served from and I have to run this on the server, or synchronize an output directory to the server, or is that going to do some sort of magic upload itself?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots more options listed on the Debian wiki, I've added Attune to the list.https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is this different to aptly, especially if one already has object storage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729427</guid></item><item><title>16.

I ended up directly using solvespace's solver instead of the suggested wrapper code since it didn't expose all of the features I needed. I also had to patch the solver to make it sufficiently fast for the kinds of equations I was generating by symbolically solving equations where applicable.(anyone looking for an easy-to-use opensource 3D CAD program should consider it)For folks not familiar w/ Solvespace it's a light-weight 3D CAD program: https://solvespace.com/index.plProbably a bit more approachable for folks is: https://www.cadsketcher.com/ which adds the Solvespace constraint solver to Blender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice.Constraint solving like that has been a feature in CAD programs for years. Here's Autodesk Inventor's 2D sketch mode.[1] You get an error if you try to overconstrain something. There's a symbolic solver checking for over-constraint.Under-constraint is harder to deal with. There's a count of the number of additional constraints needed to specify the drawing fully. You don't have to get that count down to 0, but if you aren't just sketching for illustration, it's expected that you reach the fully constrained and dimensioned state before cutting metal.Scaling problems dominate as drawings get more complex. It's easy to do this for high school geometry problems. It's hard to do it for jet engines. User interface design for dense drawings is really hard. 
What do you do when stuff is on top of other stuff? The big, expensive CAD systems (Autodesk, Dassault, SolidWorks) have struggled through the scaling problem.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3LB0f-keL8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the cited references is Guillermo Webster — and while the article lists uncmin as the desired artifact, the project that uncmin was developed for takes the concept beyond layout to back solving for desired program outputs.Carbide [0] is the project that encapsulated some of this in a workable demo.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and evolution of the Vim text editor, highlighting its origins as a clone of the VI editor created by Bill Joy in the 1970s. It elaborates on Vim's development by Bram Moolenaar in the 1990s, emphasizing its features such as modal editing, extensibility, and a strong focus on efficiency for programmers. The piece further explains the cultural significance of Vim within the programming community, its adoption across various platforms, and its influence on other text editors. Overall, it showcases Vim's legacy as a powerful and versatile tool for coding and text manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's incredible how good of a design Vi is. Try this experiment: Busybox includes a tiny clone of vi with a reduced feature set. It's very stripped down when compared to Vim or even other vi clones, but as a pure text editor it's still more powerful than most modern day IDEs.I love my Jetbrains IDEs, but you can take my Vim plugin from my cold dead hands :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always considered TECO as the ur editor.Of course, TECO is the explicit ancestor of emacs, as emacs was originally implemented as TECO macros. However, I can't find a paper trail giving similar credit to TECO for vi. That said, istuff&lt;esc&gt; is the same in TECO as it is in vi and TECO (1963) well predated vi (1976). RSTS (along with TECO) was used at Berkeley in 1974 before v6 Unix was installed by Ken Thompson on a sabbatical to his alma mater in 1975. Bill Joy started as a grad student at Berkeley that same year. emacs (1976) wasn't ported to Unix until the 80s.There's no hard evidence and neither Ken Thompson nor Joy has ever mentioned TECO. So I'm probably wrong.But I still consider TECO to be the ur editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a, thankfully past, role working remotely for an antipodal organisation with badly configured networking; often, the lag between typing several characters on the keyboard and those characters appearing on my screen could be measured in seconds! Vi key bindings were a godsend as I could send commands (eg global search &amp; edit etc) and be confident they were being applied before recieving a (delayed) visual update. I feel my experience seems to echo (albeit slightly) that of Bill Joy's vi development on a 300 baud modem!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43691020</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by Takaaki provides a detailed example of UML diagrams based on the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts outlined in Eric Evans' book. It includes visual representations of various design elements and patterns, such as entities, value objects, aggregates, and bounded contexts, demonstrating their relationships and interactions within a sample domain. The repository serves as an educational resource for developers looking to understand and implement DDD principles by leveraging UML for clearer architectural visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work heavily in this kind of system modeling (developing tools for it, and dogfooding), and still use it when high-value for figuring out or communicating an aspect of a system.Here's a challenge, to help appreciate the nature of these: try to find an error in the diagrams.It's usually harder than you might think, since, even when you know the notation and metamodel semantics, it's information-dense talking about a domain.You usually have to know or learn a lot about the domain, and/or have an domain expert you can walk through it exhaustively, before you can find errors.And an error can be whopper: a single graph edge missing, or between the wrong vertices, or with the wrong adornments can have huge implications.For example, large amounts of work that have to be redone, or a project abandoned, or a mess that takes 10x longer than it should to write, and 10x the tech debt going forward with a bad architecture, or a fundamental security flaw.One of the mistakes many people make is treating formalized diagrams as "marketecture" visuals, like they only need for handwaving sales presentation slides, where there's some kind of visual for every concept they want to be able to literally point to.Nope, if you have software engineers and domain experts communicating and reasoning about your system in only the fuzzy terms of sales/exec presentations, you're really stabbing yourself in the face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good UML is really simple UML."Then what about complex things? Can't make everything simple"Do partial diagrams. Simplify or skip things your team already knows.Also, great UML is no UML. Sometimes the code itself is short and clear enough, requiring no diagram (of course, not all diagrams are about code... but use case diagrams are rare these days anyway).Also, use cases and use case diagrams are great.Also, perfect UML is disposable. Thinking of long term diagrams that serve as documentation is a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happened to UML? I remember it was everywhere in enterprise computing 20 years ago but seems to have disappeared now.Is it still around or did it go the way of SOAP, Java Applets? If not, what has replaced it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43731250</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Poland's successful inclusion of the traditional Polonaise dance on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage. This recognition highlights the dance's significance in Polish culture, especially as it is often performed during important national celebrations and social events. The Polonaise, characterized by its elegant choreography and historical roots, embodies the spirit and identity of Poland, showcasing the country's rich cultural heritage and the importance of preserving such traditions for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the share. I used to be part of a Polish folk dancing ensemble here in Australia and we would perform this dance. As a teen I have to admit I was sometimes embarrassed to dress up and perform since in Australia people didn’t really know the traditions or history.Recently, though, I took my daughter to a class for the exact same group who is still performing and has a much larger cohort of young proud Polish Australians - am really impressed another generation is embracing their heritage this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More about the Polonaise[0].[0] https://culture.pl/en/work/dancing-through-history-the-polon...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The polonaise is a dance for those curious about classical forms. J.S. Bach included this elegant, fast-paced, stylized dance in several of his suites. Though rooted in folk traditions, the polonaise evolved into a refined court dance. For those interested, composer Sara Schumann also wrote an entire suite of polonaises, though she remains relatively unknown.To any music experts here—especially pianists—why are these called "stylized" dances? I understand they’re based on folk dance forms, but I often struggle to connect the music to the original dances. Some, like the slow and distinct sarabande, are easier to recognize. But how do you tell the difference between something like a minuet and a polonaise?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695818</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave it a series of 11 images stripped of all metadata. It performed quite well, only misidentifying the two taken in a small college town in the NE of the US. It got two questions correct on photos taken in Korea (one with a fairly clear view of Haneul Park, the other a rather difficult to identify picture not resembling anything on google of Sunrise Peak).
It got every other question in the US correct, ranging from some under-construction Austin taken from the river to some somewhat difficult shots in NYC (the upper halves of some building from Rockefeller terrace to the black wall of the MOMA).
While not perfect, I'm bluntly shocked at how well it performed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wouldn’t shock me if multimodal LLMs were good at GeoGuesser [0], but if we’re being picky, it takes more than a few examples to demonstrate a game is “solved.” I also wonder what kind of data leakage might have been at play, like other people have suggested.To be clear, my point is not that this is unimpressive, just that this doesn’t demonstrate much. (Edit: I should have said, it doesn’t demonstrate what the title claims.)[0] they were very likely trained on a large number of photos that had their location, and they have the ability to isolate features. Combinined with their ability to interpret instructions and just, well, guess, that seems like you have enough for the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I asked the just-released ChatGPT o4-mini-high to locate four photographs of varying difficulty. It didn’t get any of them right, though the guesses weren’t bad. The reasoning was also interesting to watch, as it cropped sections of the photos to examine them more closely. I put the photos, response, and reasoning trace here:https://www.gally.net/temp/20250418chatgptgeoguesser/index.h...Later: I tried the same prompt and photos with Gemini 2.5 Pro. It also got them all wrong, though with a similar degree of reasonableness to its guesses. I had thought that Google’s map and street-view data might lead to better results, but not this time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723408</guid></item><item><title>28.

    *  terms, we can approximate `sin(x)` as:
    *
    *      sin(x) ≈ x - (x^3)/3! + (x^5)/5!
    *
    *  This reduces the computational cost but comes with reduced accuracy.

I see. "reduced accuracy" is an understatement. It's just horrifically wrong for inputs outside the range of [-2, 2]https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=plot+sin+x%2C+x+-+%28x%...It cannot handle a single interval of a sin wave, much less the repeating nature? What an absolutely useless "optimization"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The following comes from the complete opposite side of computing, microcontrollers. I've been working on an embedded system where the heap is about 256 KiB and the biggest stack has 4 KiB. I do write idiomatic modern C++ for the most part (even if I hate C++ metaprogramming with a passion), but not all tricks are suitable in all situations:- CTRE is fine as long as you don't overflow the stack. I tried once to validate a string for a HTTP proxy configuration with an exhaustive regex, CTRE tried to allocate 5 KiB of stack 40 call frames in and therefore crashed the embedded system with a stack overflow. I've had to remove port validation from the regex (matching a number between 1 and 65535 was a bridge too far) and check that part by hand instead. I've also had to dumb down other CTRE regexes too in my code for similar reasons.- Several constraints and design decisions led me to mostly ditch JSON internally and write my own BSON library. Instead of the traditional dynamically-allocated tree of nodes approach it works directly in-place, so I can give it a std::vector with a chunk of reserved memory upfront and not worry about memory allocation or fragmentation later on. One major benefit is that since there are no string escape sequences, I can return directly a std::string_view for string values. There are downsides to this approach, mostly revolving around modifications: one needs to be very careful not to invalidate iterators (which are raw pointers to the underlying buffer) while doing so and adding/removing entries towards the beginning of a large document is expensive due to the memmove().- I ditched newlib for picolibc and exterminated anything that pulled in the C/C++ standard library locale code (that was over 130 kilobytes of Flash altogether IIRC), which includes among other things C++ streams (they are bad for plenty of other reasons too, but mine was program size).You seem to have mostly aimed for throughput and raw performance in your benchmarks, which is fine for a generic desktop or server-class system with a MMU and plenty of resources. Just wanna point out that other environments will have different constraints that will mandate different kinds of optimizations, like memory usage (heap/stack/program size), dynamic memory fragmentation, real-time/jitter...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a hodgepodge of random stuff.  Completely incoherent.  Would not really point anyone at this to try and dig out gems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43727743</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A different type of hard failure is when we detect that we’ll never reach our overall goal. This requires a goal that can be programmatically verified outside of the LLM.This is the largest issue : using LLMs as a black box means for most goals, we can't rely on them to always "converge to a solution" because they might get stuck in a loop trying to figure out if they're stuck in a loop.So then we're back to writing in a hardcoded or deterministic cap on how many iterations counts as being "stuck". I'm curious how the authors solve this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author of the post, love to see this here.Curious what folks are seeing in terms of consistency of the agents they are building or working with – it's definitely challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a “one-shot” AI Agent?
A one-shot AI agent enables automated execution of a complex task without a human in the loop.Not at all what one-shot means in the field.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Intuit's victory over a proposal for the IRS to implement a direct file system for tax returns, which could simplify the process for millions of taxpayers. It highlights how Intuit, through its TurboTax software, has lobbied against the direct file initiative, arguing that it threatens the company's business model.

If you need to file state, it is $15. I’ve used it for years and it works great. For a number of years I prepared my taxes on both Turbo Tax (without actually paying for it) and Free Tax USA. They always came up with the same numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Bessent (Treasury Secretary) was repeatedly asked during his confirmation hearing whether he would protect DirectFile and he said "Yes" :-)A small snippet of that conversation. The video recording has much more details -Do you agree with the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report finding that the Direct File pilot was successful and should be expanded?Answer: As noted during the hearing, I commit that for this tax season, Direct File will be operative to prevent any disruptions for taxpayers. And if confirmed, I will consult and study the program and understand it better, and evaluate whether it works to serve the best interests of taxpayers.From page 36 at https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/responses_to_qu...So he evaluated not to expand :-(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43724267</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Amusing Planet details the story of Aqua Tofana, a notorious poison widely associated with a 17th-century woman named Giulia Tofana, who became infamous for creating this lethal concoction. Designed to help women escape abusive marriages, Aqua Tofana was a clear liquid that could be discreetly added to food or drink. Tofana, who operated in Italy, faced the consequences of her actions when authorities caught on to the poison’s usage, leading to her arrest and execution. The piece explores the historical context, the societal issues surrounding marriage and abuse during that era, and the legacy of Aqua Tofana as a symbol of desperate measures taken by women for autonomy and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you for sharing the OP on HN.There's no evidence that "Agua Tofana" ever existed, and yet, for centuries, Europeans widely believed it was real, and widely feared it as a colorless, odorless, tasteless, undetectable, gradual-acting poison that could be added to anyone's food. Unscrupulous salespeople, as always, found clever ways to package and sell fake Agua Tofana -- similar to the fake snake-oil sold as "medicine" in the 18th and 19th centuries. The capacity of human beings to believe in things for which there is no evidence never ceases to amaze me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43685033</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising deep and level headed analysis. Jai intrigues me a lot, but my cantankerous opinion is that I will not waste my energy learning a closed source language; this ain’t the 90s any more.I am perfectly fine for it to remain a closed alpha while Jonathan irons out the design and enacts his vision, but I hope its source gets released or forked as free software eventually.What I am curious about, which is how I evaluate any systems programming language, is how easy it is to write a kernel with Jai. Do I have access to an asm keyword, or can I easily link assembly files? Do I have access to the linker phase to customize the layout of the ELF file? Does it need a runtime to work? Can I disable the standard library?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The net effect of this is that the software you’re running on your computer is effectively wiping out the last 10-20 years of hardware evolution; in some extreme cases, more like 30 years.As an industry we need to worry about this more. I get that in business, if you can be less efficient in order to put out more features faster, your dps[0] is higher. But as both a programmer and an end user, I care deeply about efficiency. Bad enough when just one application is sucking up resources unnecessarily, but now it's nearly every application, up to and including the OS itself if you are lucky enough to be a Microsoft customer.The hardware I have sitting on my desk is vastly more powerful that what I was rocking 10-20 years ago, but the user experience seems about the same. No new features have really revolutionized how I use the computer, so from my perspective all we have done is make everything slower in lockstep with hardware advances.[0] dollars per second&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have my doubts with Jai, the fact that Blow &amp; co seems to have major misunderstandings with regards to RAII doesn't lend much confidence.Also a 19,000 line C++ program(this is tiny) does not take 45 minutes unless something is seriously broken, it should be a few seconds at most for full rebuild even with a decent amount of template usage.
 This makes me suspect this author doesn't have much C++ experience, as this should have been obvious to them.I do like the build script being in the same language, CMake can just die.The metaprogramming looks more confusing than C++, why is "sin"/"cos" a string?Based on this article I'm not sure what Jai's strength is, I would have assumed metaprogramming and SIMD prior, but these are hardly discussed, and the bit on metaprogramming didn't make much sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43699564</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new viral trend involving the use of ChatGPT for reverse location searches based on photos. Users are sharing images, and the AI model is utilized to deduce their locations, prompting a mix of fascination and privacy concerns.

Pleased with the style I fed that into Midjourney's "Describe" feature which aims to write an image generation prompt based on the image supplied. Midjourney did include a location as part of its output description and this was indeed accurate to the original photographic source material - this is all in spite of the image fed into the system being a ChatGPT-generated caricature, with what I thought was a generic looking background.The lesson here is that these are still algorithmically generated images - and although it may not be obvious to us, even heavily stylised images may still give away a location through the inclusion of unremarkable landmarks. In my case it appears that the particular arrangement of mountains in the background was specific to a single geographic region.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worked so-so for me. Took a picture from my street, and cropped it a bit to leave out some significant landmark in the distance. It missed by around 500 km, but deduced a lot of things correctly.Then I used the uncropped picture, and it spent 3 minutes trying to look at the features of said landmark. It get hung up on some similar (and much more famous) island which is even further away from here.Lastly I used a google image photo of said landmark (which is an island with a lighthouse) - which was quite clear. But it insisted on being the same island as the previous try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725648</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to stop using self-hosted Sentry for error tracking in favor of the cloud-based version. The author highlights challenges faced with self-hosting, including maintenance, updates, and scaling issues. They emphasize the benefits of the hosted solution, such as reduced operational overhead, easier implementation, and access to advanced features. The piece ultimately advocates for the convenience and efficiency of using a managed service over the complications of self-hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We self-host sentry in Hetzner, but with a high-end server. 96c, 512gb. It ends up only costing around $300 a month, however with the scale of events that it processes, the managed version would be in the 10's of thousands.The overhead at low volume is pretty high, but in the higher volumes (25M transactions/24h) it's a massive cost saving for us.Edit:There were just some initial headaches with needing to increase kafka partitions and add replications to the transaction processors, otherwise we didn't quite leverage the available compute and the backpressure would fill Redis up until OOM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This absolutely mirrors my experience. Sentry was straightforward to deploy years ago, but now seems like one of the more egregious offenders in the, 'self host-able but increasingly prohibitively complex by design' category.As others have said, we've [0] found the only practical way to deploy this for our clients is Kuberentes + Helm chart, and that's on bare-metal servers (mostly Hetzner). It runs well if you can throw hardware and engineering time at it, which thankfully we can. But given the option we would love a simpler solution.[0]: https://lithus.eu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, that's me!When I posted this myself on Reddit, I said the following:I've long held off on actually posting this article to a platform like this one (don't bash your competition and all that), but "isn't Sentry self-hosted?" _is_ one of the most asked questions I get, and multiple people have told me this blog-post actually explains the rationale for Bugsink better than the rest of the site, so there you have it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725815</guid></item><item><title>38.

If it's not falsifiable, it's not science.EDIT: the last sentence is "Given sufficient redshift (or, equivalently, time) resolution effected by the redshift slicing, one might just find that the Hubble diagram exhibits jumps in the redshift distance relation, which would be very revealing."
So they say it's testable. However, we see the effects of "dark matter" (or whatever it really is) today affecting the spin of galaxies, so I don't see how that's compatible with the explanation of these events being "rare".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;phys.org used to be less of a gosh wow outlet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/adbed1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43682597</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of size in various contexts, particularly in relation to data, technology, and consumer products. It examines how size affects performance, usability, and perception, arguing that while larger sizes can denote power and capability, smaller sizes often offer convenience and portability.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting read, but I find it very lacking.  PGSQL memory consists of lots of parts; shared_buffers, work_mem, maintenance_work_men, OS Cache size, etc.  For those who are interested in a deeper Postgresql tuning tutorial, I suggest this[1] as it highlights a number of important tuning options - specifically for PGSQL 17.  Once your DB has been running for a while, run the postgresql-tuner app[2] to see if you have correctly applied RAM settings[2].  The repo has been around for a long time, but I find the recommendations (especially the estimated RAM usage) really good.[1] https://www.pgedge.com/blog/postgresql-performance-tuning[2] https://github.com/jfcoz/postgresqltuner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't fully understand this article but this point stuck out as probably fractally wrong:Modern DDR4 memories have a theoretical throughput of 25-30 GB/s. This is more realistically ranging between 5-10 GB/s. With a 100 GB full packed shared buffer the time required to perform one single full scan ranges between 3 and 20 seconds.Obviously DDR5 now exists and servers have multiple memory channels giving total memory bandwidth more like 200-500 GB/s. An old rule of thumb is that a computer should be able to read its entire memory in one second, although these days it may be more like 1-4 seconds.The clock replacement algorithm only needs to read metadata, so a full sweep of the metadata for 100 GB of buffers should be milliseconds not seconds. (If they're talking about a table scan instead then obviously reading from buffers is going to be faster than disk.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love working with postgres, but this is one array where it needs a lot more love.  If I deploy MongoDB it takes the whole machine and does its thing.  With postgres, you have extremely minimalistic defaults, and then you have to turn a zillion knobs before it does what it should.For beginners, it is a huge footgun, that makes people assume bad performance while evaluating.  For the experienced PG admin, it is an annoiance and a time waster.  Oh, the VM just gained 64GB RAM?  PG will sit there and stare at it.Apart from that, basically everyone starts with the PG guidelines or a generated template(25% for this, 25% divided by number of sessions for that). Then you keep wondering how much performance you left on the table.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43722981</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may be that it was time for the hardware that was previously running Arxiv to be retired and this is just another Capex -&gt; Opex decision being made by so many tech companies.I'd like to know if GCP is covering part of the bill? Or will Cornell be paying all of it? The new architecture smells of "[GCP] will pay/credit all of these new services if you agree to let one of our architects work with you". If GCP is helping, stay tuned for a blog post from google some time around the completion of the migration with a title like "Reaffirming our commitment to science" or something similarly self affirming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would love to see arXiv set up as a consortium of international academic libraries instead. Scientific publishing is where it is today because universities and scientific societies sold off or gave their journals to private enterprises. Letting Google in is a move in the wrong direction imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something that started as far back as march 2023.https://investinopen.org/blog/ioi-partners-with-arxiv-to-dev...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am curious if anyone can find the text for "IBM's Policy Letter #4" written by IBM's chairman in 1953, which is referenced in this article. I did some searching but all the links I found to the full text were broken.I ask because I think it shows what a Rorschach test the arguments over DEI have become. I at least found one quote from the Policy Letter #4 which stated "It is the policy of this organization to hire people who have the personality, talent and background necessary to fill a given job, regardless of race, color or creed." Of course, in 1953 that was a pretty bold stance given the widespread official segregation policies in the Southern US at the time. Now, though, it feel like how you view that statement depends on which "tribe" you align with in the DEI debate: Anti-DEI folks say "Exactly, we want to hire people based on merit regardless of race, color or creed, and DEI has basically turned into a policy of racial quotas" while pro-DEI folks say "The policy back then was to fight official and systemic racism, which we still need to combat today."So I'd just like to find the full original policy document so I can make up my own mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The anit-DEI stuff is predicated on an idea that there is a clear known 'best fit' for a position and it shouldn't take into account X, whatever X is. The problem is always this, nobody actually knows what a best fit really is. Nature shows us that one trait leads to longer term survival, diversity. When you think you know the traits that pick most suitable and exclude other traits then you are getting rid of the chance to find something you didn't know about. Diversity is a key ingredient in long term health and survival. The challenge though is that diversity naturally creates a certain amount of dissonance simply because you are now getting what you didn't expect. This is a feature, not a bug, so building for it is critical. A hiring policy that seeks out diversity and injects it in, in the long term, will lead to a stronger, healthier company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The general reasoning given by a lot of these companies is that WFH did not work.Same companies were telling is how well it worked and they had the numbers to back it up.I think they are looking for scapegoats for some cost cutting. Officially force people back and hopefully some will quit. In practice, many will continue to operate as before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43727727</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the evolution of college towns and their urban development, highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities they face. It examines the historical context of these towns, the impact of their universities on the local economy and culture, and the interplay between urban planning and college life. The piece advocates for thoughtful urbanism strategies that can enhance the vibrancy and livability of college towns while addressing issues such as housing, transportation, and community engagement. Overall, it aims to inspire a rethinking of how these towns can grow and thrive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m traveling through Puerto Rico. On every nice beach, when there are people, they are playing loud music. Now that is part of the local culture. To me (a European), it is abhorent, ruining the supposedly relaxing atmosphere of a beach (even more so that the music to me seems extremely repetitive).I could not convince anyone here to stop doing this. Again, for locals, this is their culture.Similarly, I don’t think most Americans can grasp the difference between American cities (including in Puerto Rico) built for cars vs for pedestrians. Most will argue (including here), that this is a function of the size of the place. And America is big, and in places sparsely unpopulated, undeniably. But this is not the reason. Europe too is big. With many less populated places. And there are cars everywhere, most people own one.It’s now cultural. Culture can change, but when combined with architecture at an industrial scale, I’m afraid the change will take much longer than a natural human lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s too easy for a vocal minority to veto good policy, like building more housing. You see this all across the country, in college towns and in California overall. It is formalized as “zoning” but that is just an official way of implementing a shortsighted policy.If you do not zone for housing you are zoning for homelessness. Plain and simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn’t it bizarre how in college short distances, walkability and building high capacity accommodations on a budget are a priority to create productive, collaborative, social and affordable environments but after college, people move to suburban hell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729609</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the troubling lack of communication within the cybersecurity industry regarding the growing threats and vulnerabilities. It highlights how this "deafening silence" can lead to complacency among organizations and a false sense of security, ultimately leaving them more susceptible to cyberattacks. The author emphasizes the need for increased transparency, proactive discussions, and shared intelligence within the cybersecurity community to effectively combat these threats and better protect against future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

While that restriction technically applies to the Legislative branch, the spirit of it clearly applies here. A president cannot simply declare someone an enemy of the state for contradicting a political narrative. That’s not national security—it’s authoritarianism, dressed up in executive language."So the Constitution does not forbid it. All executive orders, it could be argued, are authoritarian, not just the ones that you happen to dislike.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "A Survey and Classification of the Main Approaches to Emotion Recognition from Voice" reviews various methods used to detect emotions in speech. It categorizes existing approaches into three main types: feature-based, deep learning, and hybrid methods, detailing their respective strengths and weaknesses. The authors emphasize the importance of emotion recognition for human-computer interaction and discuss the challenges faced in this field, such as the need for large labeled datasets and the complexities of emotional expression in diverse contexts. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners interested in emotion detection technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "walled gardens" in the context of digital platforms and their impact on creativity and innovation. It argues that while these controlled environments can provide comfort and security, they stifle diversity and restrict access to information and new ideas. The piece highlights the dangers of becoming too reliant on such platforms, as they limit exposure to a broader range of perspectives and can ultimately hinder growth and development in various fields. The author encourages a more open and interconnected approach to digital spaces to foster creativity and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s worth amending this to just “apps can kill”.  I volunteer with search and rescue sometimes and have seen several people get into bad trouble due to reliance on phones for maps.  Sometimes it’s dead batteries or just breakage without a backup plan, but no doubt other times it’s changing behavior in the app itself, OS decided to wipe cache, app has bad info, whatever.You can say that people should know better but sometimes dead tree maps are not available, and anyway there’s no doubt that they are on the way out.  The “safe/reliable” way might even seem to be up for debate, since phones can be more waterproof than paper, less likely to blow away when you’re on top of a mountain, serve as a backup flashlight/emergency comms, etc.  But all it takes is a company that decides to force auto update and a PM that decides feature churn increases engagement and creates job security, and who knows what will break?It is kind of like packaging that’s a choking or asphyxiation hazard.. if you’re doing anything that affects millions of people, it’s almost ALWAYS a safety issue even if you don’t usually think of it that way.  No big audience or big user base without big responsibilities.  Sure you’ll probably not be held liable in law suits, but on the other hand you should probably feel bad if you’re killing people due to indifference /negligence when thinking through edge cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really the fault of the insurance company (they geo-locked the app, Apple is just respecting that).But really the idea of in-network hospitals for emergency services is nuts. Like, checkups, chronic issues—fine, your instance provider might have some preferences. But if it is an emergency (a situation in which you might die) and you have to figure out which hospital to go to first: Apple can not fix your malfunctioning society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article: I didn't care about a corporation restricting people's freedom until it hurt me.Comments: Its not the corporation, its the government.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Playing cards. With no devices and screens. Multi-player. Lots of fun.If it must be computer, then I go for good old Microsoft games - sweekend puzzle, motorbike madness or midtown madness (I have a Win7 PC with no internet). I also enjoy driving around with Forza and enjoying the scenery of the country side.I can't even dare to look at the title imagery of these new games on xbox while scrolling through list of games on app store. It's gory, weirdness and insanity being portrayed as high quality.I guess, humanity in the West craved for some excitement in their lives, due to post-war peace time being devoid of any survival struggle. And the media - movies, music, internet - kept on dumping loads of it. Even the music, which is supposed to flow with soft, pleasant and melodious tunes and beats, has turned into a cacophony of loud shouting and hysteric expressions and acts of the artists.Similar to how a military band is designed to dispense alert and agility, western music appear to have evolved to dispense fear and anxiety which was missing in their daily lives.Not only that. Lack of such frantic craziness is seen as boring (I never heard of this word boring in my childhood). Slow life in general is being viewed as socially unacceptable. We are frogs in a boiling pot.You don't have to join the mad crowd running around ferociously. Just sit back, power on your old computer, pull out the internet cable, enjoy the slow, old games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite games is A Short Hike. It's not the same kind of game as Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, etc, but the writing is brilliant and it always makes me content whenever I play it.I really wish more games like it existed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have heard two theories on how to treat anxiety:1) Paul Gilbert's theory that the brain's 'threat system' is overdeveloped and the 'soothing system' underdeveloped, and the right treatment is to stimulate the 'soothing system'.2) Steven Quartz' theory that the brain's evaluation of risk has become distorted, and that the right treatment is any form of 'risky play' that you can tolerate; with an emphasis on being able to feel you've achieved something after  taking (reasonable) risks.(Both of these are about how you reduce anxiety in the long term, not how you cope with it if you're overwhelmed in the moment).Video games could in theory work for either - but not the same ones. Under the second theory,  coziness may work in the moment, but seeking coziness could inhibit long term reduction of anxiety.I don't know which theory has the more evidence. ( Also I'm not an expert and the consensus theory might be something else entirely. )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733097</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Brad Montague highlights the vital role that librarians play in society, emphasizing their potential to be influential and "dangerous" in a positive sense. It discusses how librarians empower individuals through access to information, fostering critical thinking and intellectual freedom. Montague argues that in an age of misinformation and censorship, the work of librarians in curating knowledge and supporting diverse perspectives is more crucial than ever, positioning them as key defenders of democracy and education.&lt;/p&gt;

DELIVERING IT LIKE STANDUP!But ellipses...do not translate to funnier text. The text just has to be funny! "Pauses" only enhance what's already there!&gt; write a quippy, funny letter from a "concerned citizen" to their community highlighting the "danger" posed by librarians. said "danger" is their vendetta against ignorance, illiteracy. style should involve SUDDEN CAPS FOR EMPHASIS, ellipses...for...artificial comedic timing. But there's something more important to the style. Something being demonstrated in this very sentence. Yes - it's *short, narration-like rhythms". These shorter sentences should occupy their own paragraph.If you can replicate a blog post with a single LLM prompt, you start to wonder whether the author had the same thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last two libraries I’ve visited have been taken over by homeless … err, the unhomed. The first one had one dude watching porn and farting an impressive amount. The second one has been taken over because it’s close to a homeless encampment - becoming more of a secondary housing site and less of a library. This is in two separate cities in the PNW.I can’t even really enter into the debate about librarians since the library experience has been so entirely off putting for me. It’s most certainly not a place I’ll take my kids, even though it consumes a significant percentage of my municipal taxes.I’m envious of the folks who have a maker space-like experience, that sounds nice!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43736791</guid></item><item><title>3.

Of the future actions discussed at the end, this one seems most important to me:&gt; Investigate a solid-state replacement for the LaserDisc players.Those laserdisc players are cantankerous, mechanical beasts and even the industrial grade ones will likely be a constant point of failure across enough 80-hour operating weeks. While laserdisc based games were fairly rare, in the aggregate there were still quite a few notable titles made (led by Dragon's Lair (1983)).It would be terrific for the preservation community if someone made a solid state replacement based on an SBC like a Raspberry Pi. Fortunately, most of the games used a handful of fairly standardized serial protocols to communicate with the disc player. It doesn't seem like it would be too hard, especially using FFMPEG to drive the actual playback and the serial input could have a scriptable command parsing and translation layer. There weren't that many different commands a laser disc player could do. Basically, the usual start/stop/pause/ff/rew as well as chapter and frame seeking with simple loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Way back in 2007 someone found one of these, disassembled it(!), transported it(!), rebuilt it(!). Long story but full of great pics. [0][0] https://www.dragonslairfans.com/smfor/index.php?topic=231.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations on a very successful restoration and thanks for writing such a beautiful deep dive.The work put in here is a perfect example of how motivation can be so much stronger if it’s for the love, done by volunteers, than for any amount of money.It also evokes the Penn &amp; Teller quote, “Sometimes, magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735239</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how grid computing has enabled researchers to verify the Goldbach Conjecture for even larger numbers, achieving a world record in the process. It explains the significance of the conjecture, which posits that every even integer greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. By leveraging distributed computing resources, the team was able to handle the extensive calculations required for verification, illustrating the power of collaborative computational efforts in solving complex mathematical problems. The article highlights both the achievement and the implications for future research in number theory.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool project but... This is an egregious misrepresentation of the actual results both from significance perspective and accuracy perspective.A. No validation is done on server side to confirm the workers are reporting correct results.B. Increasing the limit by less than a thousandth of a percent does not make this a "world record"! If we go by that logic, I only have to validate one more example than you and claim a world record. And then you'd do the same. And then I'd do the same and we'll be playing "world record" ping pong all day!But "B" isn't the big problem here because we have worse problems "A"! Nobody (not even the OP) can tell if the results are accurate!No, I'm not simply dissing at a Show HN post. There are many comments here that explain these problems much better than I could.This is egregrious clickbait!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"No one has proven it mathematically up until now" is bad grammar in relation to the intended meaning. This idiom of English conveys the meaning "it has now been proven mathematically, but never before now; this is the first time".What Hiroaki wants here is "no one has proven it mathematically". Full stop.Or "no one has proven it mathematically to this day", or "no one has proven it mathematically so far".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the gridbach server trust all submitted results to be correct, or can it somehow verify them (much faster than the outsourced computation) ?
I managed to contribute 2B verifications in a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734583</guid></item><item><title>5.

Even the guy sitting down for an interview just starts dancing sitting down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, the examples are fairly impressive and the resources used to create them are practically trivial. Seems like inference can be run on previous generation consumer hardware.

&lt;p&gt;Android phones will soon feature a self-reboot function that activates after three days of inactivity. This new measure is designed to improve device performance and security by refreshing system resources and closing apps that may be consuming background processes. The update aims to enhance user experience by ensuring devices operate smoothly, especially for users who leave their phones unused for extended periods. This change is part of a broader effort by Android to optimize device functionality and maintain security standards.&lt;/p&gt;

If I'm not wrong, there was a guy that had to stay years in jail until he would comply with the judge order to unlock his device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a Google Play Services update. For GrapheneOS users without GApps wondering: A similar feature is already built-in:
https://grapheneos.org/features#auto-reboot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mine randomly reboots semi-periodically already, even when it hasn't been shown as having downloaded an update.That said, I think this is a fairly good idea, although with the encryption stuff they do, this will cause people who rarely use their phones to miss calls and alarms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735902</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "ultrathink" thing is pretty funny:&gt; We recommend using the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode, which gives Claude additional computation time to evaluate alternatives more thoroughly. These specific phrases are mapped directly to increasing levels of thinking budget in the system: "think" &lt; "think hard" &lt; "think harder" &lt; "ultrathink." Each level allocates progressively more thinking budget for Claude to use.I had a poke around and it's not a feature of the Claude model, it's specific to Claude Code. There's a "megathink" option too - it uses code that looks like this:  let B = W.message.content.toLowerCase();
  if (
    B.includes("think harder") ||
    B.includes("think intensely") ||
    B.includes("think longer") ||
    B.includes("think really hard") ||
    B.includes("think super hard") ||
    B.includes("think very hard") ||
    B.includes("ultrathink")
  )
    return (
      l1("tengu_thinking", { tokenCount: 31999, messageId: Z, provider: G }),
      31999
    );
  if (
    B.includes("think about it") ||
    B.includes("think a lot") ||
    B.includes("think deeply") ||
    B.includes("think hard") ||
    B.includes("think more") ||
    B.includes("megathink")
  )
    return (
      l1("tengu_thinking", { tokenCount: 1e4, messageId: Z, provider: G }), 1e4
    );

Notes on how I found that here: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/claude-code-best-pract...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised that "controlling cost" isn't a section in this post. Here's my attempt.---If you get a hang of controlling costs, it's much cheaper. If you're exhausting the context window, I would not be surprised if you're seeing high cost.Be aware of the "cache".Tell it to read specific files (and only those!), if you don't, it'll read unnecessary files, or repeatedly read sections of files or even search through files.Avoid letting it search - even halt it. Find / rg can have a thousands of tokens of output depending on the search.Never edit files manually during a session (that'll bust cache). THIS INCLUDES LINT.The cache also goes away after 5-15 minutes or so (not sure) - so avoid leaving sessions open and coming back later.Never use /compact (that'll bust cache, if you need to, you're going back and forth too much or using too many files at once).Don't let files get too big (it's good hygiene too) to keep the context window sizes smaller.Have a clear goal in mind and keep sessions to as few messages as possible.Write / generate markdown files with needed documentation using claude.ai, and save those as files in the repo and tell it to read that file as part of a question.
I'm at about ~$0.5-0.75 for most "tasks" I give it. I'm not a super heavy user, but it definitely helps me (it's like having a super focused smart intern that makes dumb mistakes).If i need to feed it a ton of docs etc. for some task, it'll be more in the few $, rather than &lt; $1. But I really only do this to try some prototype with a library claude doesn't know about (or is outdated).
For hobby stuff, it adds up - totally.For a company, massively worth it. Insanely cheap productivity boost (if developers are responsible / don't get lazy / don't misuse it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I have been using Cursor a lot more in a vibe code way lately and I have been coming across what a lot of people report: sometimes the model will rewrite perfectly working code that I didn't ask it to touch and break it.In most cases, it is because I am asking the model to do too much at once. Which is fine, I am learning the right level of abstraction/instruction where the model is effective consistently.But when I read these best practices, I can't help but think of the cost. The multiple CLAUDE.md files, the files of context, the urls to documentation, the planning steps, the tests. And then the iteration on the code until it passes the test, then fixing up linter errors, then running an adversarial model as a code review, then generating the PR.It makes me want to find a way to work at Anthropic so I can learn to do all of that without spending $100 per PR. Each of the steps in that last paragraph is an expensive API call for us ISV and each requires experimentation to get the right level of abstraction/instruction.I want to advocate to Anthropic for a scholarship program for devs (I'd volunteer, lol) where they give credits to Claude in exchange for public usage. This would be structured similar to creator programs for image/audio/video gen-ai companies (e.g. runway, kling, midjourney) where they bring on heavy users that also post to social media (e.g. X, TikTok, Twitch) and they get heavily discounted (or even free) usage in exchange for promoting the product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735550</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;PiLiDAR is an open-source project focused on creating a low-cost, portable LiDAR system using Raspberry Pi technology. It aims to provide an accessible solution for 3D mapping and surveying while leveraging affordable components. The project includes detailed documentation, setup instructions, and source code to help users build their own LiDAR systems, making it suitable for educational purposes, hobbyists, and professionals interested in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really coolOne thing I'd suggest, for any hardware product, is that when doing your bill of materials to provide links and show estimated costs. Sure, these will change but having a rough idea of the costs is really helpful, especially when perusing on from things like HN. It can be a big difference for someone to decide if they want to try it on their own or not. It is the ballpark figures that matter, not the specifics.You did all that research, write it down. If for no one but yourself! Providing links is highly helpful because names can be funky and helps people (including your future self) know if this is the same thing or not. It's always noisy, but these things reduce noise. Importantly, they take no time while you're doing the project (you literally bought the parts, so you have the link and the price). It saves yourself a lot of hassle, not just for others. Document because no one remembers anything after a few days or weeks. It takes 10 seconds to write it down and 30 minutes to do the thing all over again, so be lazy and document. I think this is one of the biggest lessons I learned when I started as an engineer. You save yourself so much time. You just got to fight that dumb part in your head that is trying to convince you that it doesn't save time. (Same with documenting code[0])Here. I did a quick "15 minute" look. May not be accurate  Lidar:
    One of:
      LD06: $80 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803352905216.html
      LD19: $70 https://www.amazon.com/DTOF-D300-Distance-Obstacle-Education/dp/B0B1V8D36H
      STL27L: $160 https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2726.html
  Camera and Lens: $60 https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Raspberry-Camera-Distortion-Compatible/dp/B0B1MN721K
  Raspberry Pi 4: $50
  NEMA17 42-23 stepper: $10 https://www.amazon.com/SIMAX3D-Nema17-Stepper-Motor/dp/B0CQLFNSMJ
  
That gives us $200-$280 before counting the power supply and buck converter.[0] When I wrote the code only me and god understood what was going on. But as time marched on, now only god knows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The actual scanners: [1]Max range 12 meters. That's when it seems to start to get expensive. The light source, filters, and sensors all have to get better.Good enough for most small robots. Maybe good enough for the minor sensors on self-driving cars, the ones that cover the vehicle perimeter so kids and dogs are reliably sensed. The big long-range LIDAR up top is still hard.[1] https://www.ldrobot.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related. I'm looking for a cheap way to measure distances to approx 10 microns accuracy, over distances on the order of 300mm. Any ideas?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738561</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The accent and dialect changes every 20 miles or so, so this is obviously a bit vague.We can’t even agree on what to call a bread roll [0] never mind how some words should be pronounced [1].My mother was brought up in Liverpool, but her (Irish immigrant) mother hated the Bootle accent so much that she taught her, and her older sister, to speak something closer to RP.That washed off, and like her I got bullied at school in North Derbyshire for speaking “too posh”. Yet locals in my new home of London clearly place me as being from the North but can’t place where. To be honest neither can most Northerners. I think I’m broadly “South Pennine”, so a bit of High Peak, a bit of Manchester, the odd spot of Lancashire or even West Yorkshire - reflects where I grew up, went to Uni, lived, and socialised with. My partner has a similar accent despite growing up in a part of Manchester with a distinct accent and dialect of its own.The point is, it’s complex and it’s changing. And it’s not just the UK. It seems to have sped up in recent years. When I hear Canadian voices from 70 years ago, I can hear Scottish tinges. Likewise the US East coast of the mid-20th century had more West Country in it than today.It was only a friend’s grandfathers generation that could tell what street someone grew up on from their voice alone, and today we are increasingly homogenised - I wonder what “English” will sound like in 200 or 500 years.[0] https://www.ourdialects.uk/maps/bread/[1] https://www.ourdialects.uk/maps/class-farce/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When is this map from? 1955?Essex accents had travelled well into Hertfordshire by the 1970s. Cockney has evaporated and the condensate largely landed in Essex and Hertfordshire.Do people really speak Kentish in most of Kent? Or is it a mix of Modern Estuary, MLE (multicultural London English) and RP (received pronunciation)?I know the author says that the map will always be wrong, I understand that, but this map is badly out of date.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you think this is dense, try Italy some time.  Huge numbers of highly distinct dialects, because until the mid-1800s Italians spoke huge numbers of entirely different languages, complete with their own full literature traditions.  During unification the country settled on Florence's language (the language of Dante) as the "official" language: but everyone still proudly speaks their own language.  To my knowledge, Italy is regarded as the densest diverse dialect region in Europe.How different? What Americans call arugula the British call rocket.  Because the British word is derived from the French roquette, which is from ruchetta, a word in italian dialects along the French border.  But Americans got their word from aruculu in the southern Calabrese dialect, a result of immigration.  The Italian word is rucola, from the Latin eruca.Americans think "Capeesh" is an Italian word because they heard it in The Godfather.  But it's not: it's Sicilian, as is much of the film.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734953</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the UK has seen a resurgence in insect populations, particularly in urban areas, due to changes in land use, conservation efforts, and increased public awareness. It highlights the crucial role insects play in ecosystems, such as pollination and decomposition, while addressing concerns about declining populations in other regions. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting and fostering biodiversity to ensure a sustainable environment and food security. It also shares insights into specific projects and initiatives aimed at promoting insect-friendly habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad for this family, but also:This is interesting to me at the margins, because one of the things I learned when my wife got pregnant the first time was that the womb is not exactly the warm cradle of nurturing that I had always (without thinking much about it) imagined, but in many ways a blast door or containment vessel to protect the mother (host) from the fetus (roughly, xenomorph) that would otherwise explode like an aggressive parasite (killing them both).So I mean, you probably don't want to have any leaks or weak stitches in your uterus transplant...Keywords: fetal microchimerism, placental barrier, trophoblast invasion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29485996&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s incredible and Inwish long life and happiness to the newborn and her familyI would like to reflect on the timing of this - the UK Supreme Court just ruled something about a woman is a “biological” definition - and I am willing to put a lot of money on many people on both sides of that contentious debate struggling with the idea that “someone born without a womb is a woman” and “hey we can transplant wombs now”Thousands of scientists and medical practitioners have taken thousands of baby steps to get to this point. We should fund every single one of them - we never know where research will take us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43717513</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a comprehensive guide on understanding and implementing views in JavaScript, specifically within the context of modern web applications. It emphasizes practical learning through hands-on examples, focusing on core concepts such as state management, rendering, and reactivity. The guide aims to demystify the complexities of building dynamic user interfaces by breaking down advanced topics into digestible sections, suitable for developers seeking to deepen their knowledge of view layer technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733636"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This might be heresy to many JS devs, but I think 'state' variables are an anti-pattern.I use webcomponents and instead of adding state variables for 'flat' variable types I use the DOM element value/textContent/checked/etc as the only source of truth, adding setters and getters as required.So instead of:  /* State variables */
  let name;

  /* DOM update functions */
  function setNameNode(value) {
    nameNode.textContent = value;
  }

  /* State update functions */
  function setName(value) {
    if(name !== value) {
      name = value;
      setNameNode(value);
    }
  }


it would just be akin to:  set name(name) { this.nameNode.textContent = name }
  get name() { return this.nameNode.textContent}

  /* or if the variable is used less than 3 times don't even add the set/get */ 
  setState({name}){
     this.querySelector('#name').textContent = name;
  }

Its hard to describe in a short comment, but a lot of things go right naturally with very few lines of code.I've seen the history of this creating spaghetti, but now with WebComponents there is separation of objects + the adjacent HTML template, creating a granularity that its fusilli or macaroni.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been writing recently an application in plain "vanilla" TypeScript with vite, no rendering libraries, just old-style DOM manipulation and I have to say I more and more question front end "best" practices.I can't conclude it scales, whatever it means, but I can conclude that there are huge benefits performance-wise, it's fun, teaches you a lot, debugging is simple, understanding the architecture is trivial, you don't need a PhD into "insert this rendering/memoization/etc" technique.Templating is the thing I miss most, I'm writing a small vite plugin to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The read me says this approach is extremely maintainable, but I’m not sure I agree.The design pattern is based on convention only. This means that a developer is free to stray from the convention whenever they want. In a complex app that many developers work on concurrently, it is very likely that at least one of them will stray from the convention at some point.In comparison, a class based UI framework like UIKit on iOS forces all developers to stick to using a standard set of APIs to customize views. IMO this makes code way more predictable and this also makes it much more maintainable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733636</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley crosswalk buttons have been reportedly hacked to mimic the voices of tech moguls Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, creating an unusual and humorous experience for pedestrians. Activation of the buttons triggers recordings of the two prominent figures, causing confusion and amusement among users. This incident reflects a growing trend of playful digital mischief in public spaces and raises questions about security and the implications of such modifications in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the last week I've had to deal with two large-scale influxes of traffic on one particular web server in our organization.The first involved requests from 300,000 unique IPs in a span of a few hours. I analyzed them and found that ~250,000 were from Brazil. I'm used to using ASNs to block network ranges sending this kind of traffic, but in this case they were spread thinly over 6,000+ ASNs! I ended up blocking all of Brazil (sorry).A few days later this same web server was on fire again. I performed the same analysis on IPs and found a similar number of unique addresses, but spread across Turkey, Russia, Argentina, Algeria and many more countries. What is going on?! Eventually I think I found a pattern to identify the requests, in that they were using ancient Chrome user agents. Chrome 40, 50, 60 and up to 90, all released 5 to 15 years ago. Then, just before I could implement a block based on these user agents, the traffic stopped.In both cases the traffic from datacenter networks was limited because I already rate limit a few dozen of the larger ones.Sysadmin life...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We all agree that AI crawlers are a big issue as they don't respect any established best practices, but we rarely talk about the path forward. Scraping has been around for as long as the internet, and it was mostly fine. There are many very legitimate use cases for browser automation and data extraction (I work in this space).So what are potential solutions? We're somehow still stuck with CAPTCHAS, a 25 years old concept that wastes millions of human hours and billions in infra costs [0].How can enable beneficial automation while protecting against abusive AI crawlers?[0] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10911&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FWIW, Trend Micro wrote up a decent piece on this space in 2023.It is still a pretty good lay-of-the-land.https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabil...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738603</guid></item><item><title>15.

Most fungi cannot survive at human body temperature (~37°C). Rising global temperatures are driving fungi to adapt by becoming more thermotolerant, enabling them to survive and replicate at human body temperatures.Effects of climate change on fungal infections

Pigs, cows or poultry might become spread the adaptions and then spread them to humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the editorial in Nature:Around 3.8 million people die each year of infections caused by C. auris and other fungi. Annual deaths caused by fungal infections have nearly doubled in the past decade.Pathogenic fungi pose unique challenges, and overcoming them will require innovative approaches to both science and policy. Yet, despite the growing global threat posed by drug-resistant fungi, such infections rarely loom large in discussions of antimicrobial resistance. Two World Health Organization (WHO) reports published this month (see go.nature.com/3rniybw) — the organization’s first analyses of tests and treatments for fungal infections — highlight the result of that neglect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practically, there's no way to stop anti-microbial resistance. We've only been capable of using said drugs for an x number of years because of the relatively long time it takes for these resistant spores to become dominant in most soil around the planet. The problem isn't really the development of resistance itself but our way of farming is the perfect petri-dish for fungal and bacterial evoluton. E.G. large monocrop fields with single-use anti-fungal spray and rinse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705190</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ancient irrigation systems of Peru, highlighting their effectiveness in transforming arid desert landscapes into productive farms. It emphasizes that these systems thrived due to a strong cultural understanding and community involvement, including practices and beliefs that supported sustainable agriculture. Without this cultural foundation, the intricate irrigation methods failed, illustrating the critical role of societal values and knowledge in the success of agricultural innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Ancient beliefs, behaviors and norms – what archaeologists call culture – were fundamentally integrated into technological solutions in this part of Peru in ancient times. Isolating and removing the tools from that knowledge made them less effective.Ancient beliefs, behaviors and norms may have helped indigenous people perpetuate the solutions/technologies. Studying and understanding those may help people - today - to more quickly understand those solutions. But it's not like a thorough understand ing and application of these technologies - today - require us to "maintain technology and culture coupling" as this _archeologist professor_ implies.The Spanish may have made wrong assumptions at first and failed to replicate the solution, but if we still see it being used today, that's because the colonist eventually learned - without perpetuating the culture (not to the same extend as the indigenous)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And no mention in the article of the ways of culture that managed the systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inca aqueduct network is seriously impressive even in the current age. Some of it almost a thousand years old and still transporting spring water miles with no pumps, without a civilization to maintain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43712536</guid></item><item><title>17.

And just now, I've seen numerous news and government sites that do not have CAA enabled... making them vulnerable to issuance bugs like this on CAs they may never have heard of, and thus making their readership/constituencies vulnerable to misinformation and fraud, especially in the context of a potential multifaceted attack against router infrastructure to perform MITM attacks at scale.Of course, you'll want to make sure you don't accidentally disavow an important subdomain where an engineer used a different CA than your usual suspects. But looking at all historic issuers for your domain hierarchies on transparency logs using e.g. https://crt.sh/ might be a good place to start.It's also good to monitor certificate transparency logs, but then the onus is on your security team to react if an incident occurs. Proactive controls are vital as well, and IMHO CAA avoids many of the downsides of pinning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I guess you couldn't get certificates for any random (MX) domain, only for those where you can obtain an inbox / user account. Still really bad, especially for things like gmail.com, but also larger enterprises. Intense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a ... pretty serious oversight.But at least it initially appears SSL.com is taking it seriously, we'll have to see what the report says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738485</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses ocean-based climate solutions, specifically focusing on iron fertilization as a method to enhance carbon sequestration in the oceans. It explains how adding iron to nutrient-poor areas of the ocean can stimulate phytoplankton growth, potentially absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The piece outlines the scientific basis behind this process, the potential benefits, and the environmental concerns associated with its implementation, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the ecological impacts and ensure that such interventions do not disrupt marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been following this research since the 1990s. My recollection is that a consensus emerged that it is less effective than originally hypothesized and there are some adverse side effects that would be difficult to manage. This is why it fell out of favor.As I recall, while it does cause significant blooms in the areas that you seed, it also induces nutrient depletion in other regions, suppressing growth there and potentially damaging ecosystems that developed around the natural nutrient gradient. It became apparent that the “free lunch” wasn’t actually free and it was mostly just rearranging where things grew based on the interaction of various nutrient gradients. The net effect is therefore much smaller than originally thought and there is a risk that it inadvertently reduces the output of important fisheries due to complex oceanic chemistry interactions that are not fully understood.I don’t think much has changed with respect to our understanding of it. It is currently filed under “probably a bad idea” as far as I know. But that’s why we do the science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see some small scale experiments in geoengineering. Despite multiple climate agreements, over my life time - I have not seen any actual progress on climate change outside of technological advancement. Technology such as wind, solar, BEVs, and similar appear to be coming far too slowly to avoid catastrophe. Perhaps China's recent push on BEV and similar technologies will tip the scale, but I am skeptical.Human's have been geoengineering for millenia via clear cutting of forests, bio engineering of crops, fertilization of fields, damming of rivers, and other activities. While there will certainly be consequences and side effects, even a partial sequestering of ~20B tonnes of CO2 per year would meet the Kyoto protocol.Are the consequences of Geo Engineering so disastrous that we should accept the worst case scenarios of global warming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a big systemic circle is imbalanced, we often feel that adding a smaller circle of push or nudge will balance it.But there are wobbly second order effects and the curves finally settle in the third order, often further away from our initial imagination.Iatrogenics is the branch of science studying outcomes where interventions make the situation worse off.Not a judgement on this or any other method, but a recurring pattern to be aware of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43692878</guid></item><item><title>21.

[RFdiffusion](https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-prot...), used for the protein discovery, is a model somewhat related to diffusion-based image generation. So much of the attention right now is about what LLMs can do with their coding, agentic, and research capabilities as they get more and more powerful and self-improving. It's fun to be reminded that ground-breaking things still can come from "your dad's neural networks."Also... just because I was checking through the results of the paper to see if it was actually an interesting result: "The SHRT binder provided complete protection (100%) to mice . . . . The LNG binder exhibited comparable efficacy, completely neutralizing α‐cobratoxin but not the non-target ScNtx"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "over 100,000 deaths" seems like a slight exaggeration, this paper bounds the estimate at 40,000-80,000: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33627-9 Wikipedia's "Epidemiology of snakebites" had similar estimates.That's still a lot of people! But I was skeptical of 100,000, especially without a source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, how to prevent the attempts of big pharma to patent these to make tens of thousand of Indians/Africans pay big $$.
These AI modelers are reputedly not validly a human creation = patent/copyright.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hype levels are so overwhelming that AI coding could never hope to meet them. I've tried having a highly-ranked AI 
 coding app write unit tests for a relatively complex codebase. 80% of the generated test cases failed. But an experienced human such as myself could use those as a starting point since it took care of some of the tedious boilerplate. It genuinely saved me some time and annoyance, but could never hope to replace even the lowliest competent junior dev.That's what AI is good for right now - boilerplate acceleration. But that's clearly not enough to drive the immense transfers of capital that this high ecosystem demands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So what have we redefined vibe coding to mean exactly?The original tweet[1] talked very specifically about not caring about quality, just accepting whatever code the AI produces blindly, as long as you get the black box output you're looking for, and just randomly try again if you didn't.Are people now using this term to mean "giving an AI agent broad tasks"?[1] https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This all reminds me a lot of the early 2000's, when big corporations thought they could save a lot of money by outsourcing development work to low-income countries and have their expensive in-house engineers only write specifications. Turns out most of those outsourcing parties won't truly understand the core ideas behind the system you're trying to build, won't think outside the box and make corrections where necessary, and will just build the thing exactly as written in the spec. The result being that to get the end product you want, the spec needs to be so finely detailed and refined that by the time you get both specification and implementation to the desired quality level, it would have been the same amount of effort (and probably less time and frustration) to just build the system in-house.Of course outsourcing software development hasn't gone away, but it hasn't become anywhere near as prevalent and dominant as its proponents would've had you believe. I see the same happening with AI coding - it has its place, certainly for prototyping and quick-and-dirty solutions - but it cannot and will not truly replace human understanding, ingenuity, creativity and insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739037</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think battery buses have comprehensively won this one, to be honest. The biggest hydrogen bus fleet seems to be 35 vehicles; there are many BEV bus fleets in the hundreds and some in the thousands.As a certified old person, I'm having trouble getting used to them. It is unnatural for a double-decker bus to pull up near-silently, and then move off smoothly when you get on. They are _supposed_ to vibrate violently and sound like they might explode at any moment; it's traditional.(One of the bus route closest to me has a mix of fancy BEV buses and ancient diesel things from 2007, so I get an interesting selection. The other is mostly plugin hybrids, which are extra-disconcerting, as they're either silent or very noisy depending on mode.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not really sure there is any place for a discussion - you would need a whole new infrastructure for hydrogen powered buses, while keeping a lot of the downsides of fossil fueled air breathing vehicles (eq. air filters filters regardless of if you burn the hydrogen or use it in fuel cells).With battery buses - you might need to slightly beef up the local transformer and installs some new wires and that's it.Or even better, do what the city mass transit company does here in Brno, Czech Republic - get trolley busses with batteries, that charge from the overhead wires while on the way, so they can then continue to serve additional destinations past the terminus of road electrification.It is also super handy for any road work, they just automatically stow their collectors and then once again under wires, deploy them. There is usually a small trough around the wires at this spot, guiding the 2 collectors to the 2 wires. As a result, the driver does not have to leave the vehicles when connecting or disconnecting from wired power.And it looks super cool! :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a very to-the-point diagram called the Hydrogen Ladder [0] that classifies the usefulness of hydrogen by domain. The author makes a good case that, despite its versatility, hydrogen is almost always worse than some other clean technology for any use case. It’s hard to make, store, and use in a scalable/cheap way, and even generous estimates of future progress show a cost curve that requires subsidies basically forever.Buses are classified as a “Most Uncompetitive” category. Electricity, whether wired or battery powered, is cheaper and easier to scale for the predicable everyday energy use of a city bus.0: https://www.liebreich.com/hydrogen-ladder-version-5-0/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43703998</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. This looks like just the thing to try out Zig. 
Where can I get historical data to try this on? Are there data sets that are pretty recent? I’d like to get a few months of data but right until yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was actually revoking my hobby site for backtesting and casually developing it these days (indicatorinsights.co). Just saw this, very interesting work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's still not clear to me that past data has any information about future prices or that repeating trends appear with any statistical significance. Especially major indexes that aggregate lots of equities. It's not clear if they ever did and if they did if they still do now that everything is electronic and very fast. I understand there are studies showing momentum phenomena, etc. Maybe there would be if Renaissance Technologies and these other gigachad companies didn't exist, but they do.I understand that "stocks in play" (boomer slang for meme stocks) display whacky irrational behavior that makes no sense, or there is just a temporary combination of high volatility at relatively low market cap, and therein lies potential profit opportunities. It's not clear whether an algorithmic trading strategy is applicable to such situations although I do see people always mention "stock screeners" which seems to just be code to filter time series.After taking into account transaction costs, slippage and taxes, it's not clear that there is anything better to do than buy and hold low-cost index funds.Also, there is a separate problem around having the computer structure/segment large trades to reduce market impact to get the best deal possible by looking at the order book to wait for people willing to buy/sell a lot at reasonable prices or something -- that is a different kind of algorithmic trading from what most people mean when they say they are backtesting a trading strategy like moving average crossover or something.It all just feels too much like alchemy. But, if you become independently wealthy by writing code or you just don't lose a lot of money and you find it fun so it's sort of like paying to do something you enjoy, God bless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43712877</guid></item><item><title>25.

The information in it is well written, however... The use of "HLA" (High Level Assembly) is a real turn off, at least for me. Really wish this book was targeting standard vendor compilers instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read the first edition at the time and was excited for the new one when it was released but the HLA stuff killed it for me. It was like spending time learning a worse C that would never be used anywhere and wasn't improving my knowledge of Assembly itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved to do little assembly patches to modify any exe/app to my desire (e.g. disable certain notifications/popups , add lifes, change values etc). Unfortunately with code signing this joy is no longer part of my pastime.I'm not interested in optimizing the last microsecond of my programs so for normal development it has exactly 0 relevance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739285</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article — and several other high-quality deep dives linked at the end! Here's another one on the H100 that I found particularly useful: &lt;https://cudaforfun.substack.com/p/outperforming-cublas-on-h1...&gt;I agree with the author that programming GEMM on newer GPUs is a very different experience, though I'm wondering if "newer GPUs are [actually strictly] better"? It seems like there should still be some highly cost-effective use cases for T4 GPUs — aren't there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some related fun facts:1. That roofline curve idea applies to multiple processes, computers, and data centers just as well. If you have enough "cache" (disk, RAM, whatever), you can do a distributed matmul and actually effectively use every coprocessor at nearly 100% efficiency.2. If you need f32 intermediate precision, you can approximate that with Kahan-like ideas and still take advantage of the f16 core, at somewhere in the 25%-50% efficiency range (still much better than the &lt;10% you get by ignoring the tensor core).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"An H100 GPU has 989 TFLOPs of half-precision matrix multiply compute, and ~60 TFLOPs of “everything else”"I always thought there was a lot of crossover between gaming GPU's &amp; DC GPU's (and the volume is why NVIDIA is so far ahead). Are tensor cores somehow related to the pre tensorcore SM's (like an abstraction on top of SM's?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43736739</guid></item><item><title>28.

I would very much like to see other researchers replicate this. I am automatically more skeptical than I would be of most research because if humming a certain note were an effective treatment for motion sickness, then it would be rather surprising that people had not already discovered this property -- possibly just by listening to various pieces of music.Just as research which suggests a surprising outcome or one inconsistent with existing theories must meet a higher bar, so too does research which suggests a simple cure that it was already possible for people to stumble across.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43740021</guid></item><item><title>29.

What resources are there that might teach one about Maxwell‘s equations and the electromagnetic field tensor arisig from relativity? The magnetic field is a description of the electric field with relativistic effects. Is there a way of describing electromagnetism without the magnetic field?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something but the whole point of gauge theory (connections on a principal bundle) is that this is true, right? U(1) gauge theory gets you electromagnetism as a purely geometric result already?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The Dirac equation can be therefore interpreted as a purely geometric equation, where the mc2 term directly relates to spacetime metric. There is no need to involve any hypothetical Higgs field to explain the particle mass term.What happens to the Higgs field excitation and the Higgs boson, given the experiments confirming their existence? If this paper explains phenomena more effectively, does it require us to reinterpret these findings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739529</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides strategies for encouraging children to engage with math in a more enjoyable and effective way. It emphasizes the importance of making math relatable and fun through games and real-life applications, rather than forcing them to do it against their will. The author suggests creating a positive environment, incorporating interactive tools, and setting achievable goals to motivate kids to develop their math skills voluntarily. Overall, the piece advocates for fostering a love for math through creativity and support rather than coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very poor take. The author clearly has very limited experience with raising kids. Most kids won't do difficult things if you don't push them. Playing music, learning to spell correctly, doing mathematics, and so on. A very small minority of kids will do all of that easily and for the fun, but you can't rely on it. If you don't push your kid to do their 20 minutes of piano every day, they will half-ass it and will stop after 1 year and conclude they are not good at music. Same for sport. Same for reading books. Same for maths. And you know what? It's your fault. You chose to be lazy and complacent and didn't push them because it's hard to be a good parent. And now you expect me to validate your laziness? Nah.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Without realizing it, he was doing algebra.A friend of mine taught remedial math at UW to incoming freshmen. She would write:    x + 2 = 5

on the blackboard and ask a student "what is the value of x?" The student would see the x, and immediately respond with x means algebra, algebra is hard, I cannot do algebra.So she started writing:    _ + 2 = 5

and ask the student to fill in the blank. "Oh, it's 3!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this isn't quite the same thing, never the less: I have dyscalculia on extreme mode (/dyslexia/autism), and I was forced to do math in the 90s in the UK, rote style. I don't know if they didn't know about dyscalculia, didn't care, or whatever, but holy hell I wish I'd never been forced to do that, it's still today a fairly painful memory and I'm in my 40s now. If you're gonna force kids into math, at least make sure they're not unable to process it correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738195</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Latent space dimension of generative models" discusses how to analyze the latent space of various generative models, focusing on understanding the dimension of the latent space in relation to the complexity and diversity of the generated data. It presents a theoretical framework to quantify the latent space dimension and explores its implications for both the performance of generative models and the understanding of the underlying data distributions. Key findings suggest that correctly identifying the latent space dimension can improve model training and data generation processes, ultimately contributing to advancements in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm glad somebody did the hard work of proving it.Though, if this is so clearly seen, how come AI detectors perform so badly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They're discovering the wrong thing. And the analogy with biology doesn't hold.They're sensitive not to architecture but to training data.  That's like grouping animals by what environment they lived in, so lions and alligators are closer to one another than lions and cats.The real trick is to infer the underlying architecture and show the relationships between architectures.That's not something you can tell easily by just looking at the name of the model. And that would actually be useful. This is pretty useless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43736366</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Monksy's Theorem discusses a fundamental result in geometric topology, specifically regarding the classification of certain types of geometric structures. It explains the theorem's significance in determining how three-dimensional manifolds can be represented and provides insights into the theorem's proof, applications, and implications for understanding the properties of more complex geometrical shapes. The content is aimed at readers with an interest in advanced mathematics, particularly topology, and emphasizes both the theoretical and practical aspects of the theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven't read the article. But something about this reminds me of Arnold's topological proof of the unsolvability of the quintic (YouTube form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSHv9Elk1MU ; PDF: https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/394/ArnoldQuintic.p...).It seems a lot of impossibility theorems - the type that the ancient Greeks would have understood - can be proven using algebraic topology. Perhaps Sperner's lemma can be seen as an algebraic topology theorem? I don't personally know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; no face of P, nor any face of one of the Ti, contains vertices of all three colorsThat should be 'edge', not 'face', no? Otherwise I do not understand what is happening at all with the examples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To show that detM
 is non-zero, we can show that its 2-adic valuation is nonzero.I think the last word in that sentence should be "finite"?Also do I understand correctly that "face" means "maximal line segment"? (I see some other comments discussing this and concluding that "face" means "edge", but to me, an "edge" doesn't permit "intermediate" vertices.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739510</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the need for reform in voting systems to enhance democracy and voter engagement. It emphasizes the importance of a transparent and efficient electoral process, suggesting improvements such as ranked-choice voting and better access to polling places. The author argues that adopting modern technology can increase voter turnout and ensure that elections reflect the true will of the people. The piece advocates for ongoing dialogue and education about voting rights to empower citizens and strengthen democratic practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to gloss over the major difference between Scandinavian voting systems and e.g. the US one: They are very party-focused. At the end of the day it’s the cabals at the top of the major parties that decide who gets to sit in parliament and how they vote. Sometimes it feels like it would be more honest if e.g. Swedish parliament just had 8 members and their voting buttons controlled more / fewer lights on the voting results dashboard. Leads to a very collectivist political culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that it's possible to achieve proportional representation with respect to geographic distribution and party votes simultaneously. (Though, as the article notes, Iceland falls short of this ideal.)This makes me wonder: why stop at two? Some places have explicit quotas for different ethnic or religious groups as a compromise to avoid civil war. Could they use a tripoportional system?And why not add in even more demographic variables? Age, gender, income, level of education, ... I suppose at some point it stops being a secret election because the number of voters sharing all attributes becomes too small, or the parliament would get unwieldily large trying to represent every hyperspecific constituency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted more details on how this works. For those interested, I found an English pdf describing the full system [1]. The interesting part is Article 110, which discusses how the adjustment seats are allocated. Here is my best summary:1. Using D'Hondt [2] on every party's national vote share, determine which party should be given the next seat.
2. For every constituency which has adjustment seats available, calculate the D'Hondt quotient of the first candidate in that party who has not already been elected using the constituency vote share. So if a party received V votes in a constituency and two party members were already elected from this constituency, their quotient would be V/3.
3. Elect the candidate with the highest quotient to fill an adjustment seat for their constituency.
4. Repeat until all adjustment seats have been given away.There's arguably a step 0 here, which is determining how many constituency and adjustment seats every constituency gets, and this is done before the election is held. This is described in Article 10. It's pretty bad. First, the adjustment seats are hard-coded. Second, unlike the US where we reapportion after every census, Iceland appears to only reapportion the constituency seats when the constitution demands they do it. This happens when there are twice as many voters per seat in one constituency compared to another. Furthermore, they only adjust as few seats as possible to get back under this limit rather than actually recalculate a fair apportionment. I'm not sure what the logic of this was, maybe to minimize how often the number of seats in each place is changing? Either way, in the 2021 election this resulted in one constituency with 199% as many voters per seat as another and no changes were made [3].[1]: https://www.stjornarradid.is/library/03-Verkefni/Kosningar/K...[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Icelandic_parliamentary_e...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738675</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fascinating existence of organisms that inhabit the threshold between life and death, focusing on a group of creatures known as 'an extremophile' which can survive in extreme conditions, such as desiccation or extreme temperatures. It discusses how these animals exhibit remarkable adaptations that enable them to enter states of dormancy, thus allowing them to endure harsh environments. This survival mechanism raises intriguing questions about the nature of life, resilience, and the biological processes that dictate the boundaries of living organisms. Additionally, the piece delves into the philosophical implications of these adaptations and what they reveal about the definitions of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what comes of trying to define binary, all-or-nothing categories in a world of continuous variation. Any sharp boundary you try to draw between "life" and "death" is going to have exceptions. Making heavy weather out of this, instead of recognizing "life" and "death" as approximate categories that are useful for many purposes but can break down at the edges, is just muddled thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those rotifers might have inspired the 3-body problem's concept of dehydration/rehydration as a skill to survive cataclysms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At some level, if you are capable of being revived, I think your death was prematurely reported, defined by being revived. But, if you are not revived from a quiescent state, now or into the future, is there a functional difference between being quiescent, and being dead?Down at the viral level, if they crystallise, they're stable. If they managed to get into rock in a crystallised state, how long would they remain stable? Do we define viruses as "not alive" now? or prions? or mitochondria?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43712024</guid></item><item><title>38.

However like many zettelkasten implementations it gives the user too much freedom imo. To me zettelkasten are most useful because of their limitations, like restricting the size of each note, limiting how many notes you can see at a time, or limiting how fast you can traverse through notes. I think it's more important to be able to hold the overall structure of notes in your mind, which zettelkasten facilitates by intentionally making everything harder to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apologies, but this reads like one of those net.kook manifestos from the 1990ies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735693</guid></item><item><title>39.

It took concerted effort, but learning to think with data-first design patterns and laser focusing on human needs broke through that barrier for me.Writing APL that feels good and is maintainable ends up violating all kinds of cached wisdom amongst developers, so it's really hard to communicate just how brutally simple things can be and how freeing that is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing the tag (1970), and the paper text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/System-Design-of-a-Cel...And on sci-hub, it is really unfortunate that IEEE hasn't followed the ACM and removed their paywall for ancient articles.

In my volunteer fire department, we've adopted a "two sets of eyes" policy on all technical rope rigging before declaring it ready.I know humans are fallable, but I feel like there are some basic, workplace culture driven techniques that could substantially help here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a comparison in the UK there is robust mandatory reporting on "Retained foreign object post procedure" which is a so-called "Never Event" in the most recent publication (April 2024 to September 2024) this occurred 60 times[1] in the NHS in England. For a denominator there are approximately 21 million operation performed in a year by NHS England[2]. So roughly 0.002% of cases have an unintended retained object or roughly 1 in 50,000.For further reading the Health Services Safety Investigations Body in the UK (like the NTSB but for healthcare incidents is the best worst analogy) looked at retained foreign objects and published in 2024: https://www.hssib.org.uk/patient-safety-investigations/retai...[1]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/provisional-publication...

They didn't match up, and it turned out that the surgeon had dropped one off of the table.The article mentions that counting is standard procedure, so hopefully this is how it works everywhere. It definitely seems like having someone who isn't the surgeon doing the counting would be the way to go. The surgeon is already very focused and it's easier to say "I'm sure I didn't leave anything" when someone else isn't telling you otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43710996</guid></item><item><title>41.

I love it when a system like this A. does not try to railroad you into the "correct path" and B. the independent layers actually work independently.One day in what was probably sullen resentment that openbsd has no equivalent to DRBD I assembled a raid on iscsi drives, that is, initiate 5 iscsi sessions to independent hosts then assemble a raid with them. and you can imagine my surprise when it very nearly worked, I could read and write just fine. The part that did not work was drive failure.  My guess is that iscsid did not fail a drive in a way that softraid understood. so a drive failure just lead to everything hanging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a YouTube video on the Action Retro channel, where this article is used as inspiration. Apparently you're not able to use any random floppy drive, but you can use more than five.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hc52_PWeU8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43699301</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article expresses a critical view of the excessive hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it leads to unrealistic expectations and misunderstandings about the technology's capabilities. The author emphasizes the importance of grounded and realistic discussions about AI, warning against the influence of sensationalism that can overshadow its limitations and challenges. Additionally, the piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of AI's potential impacts on society and urges readers to approach discussions about the technology with skepticism and caution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a shallow, negative post. "Hype" is tautologically bad. Being negative and "above the hype" makes you sound smart, but this post adds nothing to the discussion and is just as fuzzy as the hype it criticizes.&gt; It is a real shame that some of the most beneficial tools ever invented, such as computers, modern databases, data centers, etc. exist in an industry that has become so obsessed with hype and trends that it resembles the fashion industry.Would not the author have claimed at the time that those technologies were also "hype"? What consistent principle does the author use (a priori) to separate "useful facts" from "hype"?Or, if the author would have considered those over-hyped at the time, then they should have some humility because in 10 years they may look back at AI as another one of the "most beneficial tools ever invented".&gt; In technology, AI is currently the new big hype. ... 10% of the AI hype is based on useful factsThe author ascribes malice to people who disagree with them about the use of AI. The author says proponents of AI are "greedy", "careless", unskilled, inexperienced, and unproductive. How does the author know that these people don't believe that AI has great utility and potential?Don't waste your time on this article. I wish I hadn't. Go build something, or at least make thoughtful, well defined critiques of the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, AI hype seems to be the most tangible/real hype in a decade.Ever since mobile &amp; cloud era at their peaks in 2012 or 2014, we’ve had Crypto, AR, VR, and now AI.I have some pocket change bitcoin, ethereum, played around for  2 minutes on my dust-gathering Oculus &amp; Vision Pro; but man, oh man! Am I hooked to ChatGpt or what!It’s truly remarkably useful!You just can’t get this type of thing in one click before.For example, here’s my latest engineering productivity boosting query:
“when using a cfg file on the cmd line what does "@" as a prefix do?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's three types of people w.r.t hype: smart people who resist hype, smart people who want to profit off of it, and dumb people who like it.The first type of person already agrees with you.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Frank, an open-source web framework that simplifies the development of web applications by allowing developers to write code in Python, which is then automatically converted into JavaScript for the front-end. It highlights Frank's features, such as its lightweight nature, user-friendly API, and ability to support various web standards. Additionally, the article provides examples of how to implement various functionalities using Frank, demonstrating its efficiency and ease of use for both beginners and experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing anything like this in __init__ is crazy. Even `Path("config.json").read_text()` in a constructor isn't a good idea.Friends don't let friends build complicated constructors that can fail; this is a huge violation of the Principle of Least Astonishment. If you require external resources like a zeromq socket, use connect/open/close/etc methods (and a contextmanager, probably). If you need configuration, create a separate function that parses the configuration, then returns the object.I appreciate the author's circumstances may have not allowed them to make these changes, but it'd drive me nuts leaving this as-is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty simple to fix by changing the _init to something like:    def _init(self):
        init_complete = threading.Event()
        def worker_thread_start():
            FooWidget.__init__(self)
            init_complete.set()
            self.run()

        worker_thread = Thread(target=worker_thread_start, daemon=True)
        worker_thread.start()
        init_complete.wait()


Spawning worker thread from constructor is not that crazy, but you want to make sure the constructing is completed by the time you return from the constructor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; solving an annoying problem with a complete and utter disregard to sanity, common sense, and the feelings of other human beings.While I enjoy comments like these (and the article overall!), they stand stronger if followed by an example of a solution that regards sanity, common sense and the feelings of others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735724</guid></item><item><title>47.

Electricity is easy to run experiments on and prove, meaning humans can manipulate it for our benefits easy. However, the Higgs Boson was extremely difficult to prove and I see no way that it could ever benefit humanity's wellbeing. Now how could humans improve our wellbeing by manipulating dark matter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how long would it go without finding dark matter before physicists would get worried?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The AQ is designed so its frequency can be transmitted into space, a frequency that would match with the axion. When it identifies and 'tunes in' to that frequency, it will emit very small amounts of light. AQ operates at the highest terahertz frequencies, which many researchers believe to be the most promising place to look for axions.Can someone explain this using an analogy that makes sense?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715790</guid></item><item><title>1.

One issue I noticed was that the output was a little too much "for dummies". Spending paragraphs to explain what an API is through restaurant analogies is a little unnecessary. And then followed up with more paragraphs on what GraphQL is. Every chapter seems to suffer from this. The generated documentation seems more suited for a slightly technical PM moreso than a software engineer. This can probably be mitigated by refining the prompt.The prompt would also maybe be better if it encouraged variety in diagrams. For somethings, a flow chart would fit better than a sequence diagram (e.g., a durable state machine workflow written using AWS Step Functions).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had not used gemini before, so spent a fair bit of time yak shaving to get access to the right APIs and set up my Google project. (I have an OpenAPI key but it wasn't clear how to use that service.)I changed it to use this line:   api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", "your-api_key")

instead of the default project/location option.and I changed it to use a different model:    model = os.getenv("GEMINI_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25")

I used the preview model because I got rate limited and the error message suggested it.I used this on a few projects from my employer:- https://github.com/prime-framework/prime-mvc a largish open source MVC java framework my company uses. I'm not overly familiar with this, though I've read a lot of code written in this framework.- https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-... a smaller example application I reviewed and am quite familiar with.- https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-jwt a JWT java library that I've used but not contributed to.Overall thoughts:Lots of exclamation points.Thorough overview, including of some things that were not application specific (rails routing).Great analogies. Seems to lean on them pretty heavily.Didn't see any inaccuracies in the tutorials I reviewed.Pretty amazing overall!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is nice and fun for getting some fast indications on an unknown codebase, but, as others said here and elsewhere, it doesn't replace human-made documentation.https://passo.uno/whats-wrong-ai-generated-docs/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739456</guid></item><item><title>4. 100 Years to Solve an Integral (2020)</title><link>https://liorsinai.github.io/mathematics/2020/08/27/secant-mercator.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Secant Mercator projection, a map projection used in cartography that represents the Earth’s surface. It explains the mathematical principles behind the projection, including how it minimizes distortion by using two standard parallels rather than one, which improves accuracy for mid-latitude areas. The author provides visual examples and equations necessary to derive the projection, alongside practical applications and considerations for its usage in various geographic mappings. Overall, the content serves as both an educational resource and a technical guide to understanding and applying the Secant Mercator projection in mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s right, exp(-x^2) is not the only one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neither in (German) high school nor in the many math courses of a physics B.Sc. have I ever used the secant function. I am surprised the article does not explain it in the beginning. I assume for other people it must be a common function?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we're playing the map-projection-advocacy game, I'd say the Mollweide projection is underrated among equal-area maps [0]. (For local maps, use whatever you want, appropriately centered.) Sure, it distorts shapes away from the central meridian, but locally it only adds a simple horizontal skew. I'm not a big fan of how many equal-area 'compromise' projections lie about how long the lines of latitude are.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollweide_projection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43741273</guid></item><item><title>5.

It was perfect, plants gave amazing yield, but required too detailed care and attention every day (or sometimes 2-3 times a day in a hot dry summer day). When I have moved to planting in soil I was shocked how worse the plants are doing. Same tomatoes giving 10-15 kg per plant yield in pots were under 3kg in soil. They got more disease issues, more pests (slugs and snails!).After talking to fellow natural hobby farmers I realized the soil quality was garbage (lack of earth worms and insects), and there were severe drainage and water holding issues: weirdly the soil didn't hold water but it drained way too slow too. So, ehen it rained it was swamped for days but when it got dry none of that water stayed at the top 1 meters of the soil. I'm lucky to find amazing help from local natural farmers, so I got natural green compost (no animal products/byproducts). I have been introduced to no-dig farming too. So first year I started by applying 20cm thick compost on top soil, after putting a layer of old paper boxes against weeds. Then planted my seedlings on these, with worm poop and for some phosphate loving plants bat guano as fertilizers around the plants, topping of with hemp mulch and cacao shell mulch as topping. When this soil has sunken enough, topped off with 2-3 cm compost and mulched again. I have sprinkled insect friendly flowers to attract insects too. This was an amazing succes with not only plants flourishing, fighting diseases much better and resulting in an amazing yield. I didn't need to water as often as before (4x less frequent than before in the soil, 8x less frequent than in the pot).  After year 3 I stopped all fertilization and introduced cover crops that could be used as mulch and fertilizer at the same time.This process though is not linear. I still have plants which are not successful at all. I can grow juicy tasty watermelons in a northern European country but no parsnips or carrots or cauliflowers yet. This is what I love though, I'm interacting with a living microbiome rather than executing lab experiments. Failures are keeping it interesting and improving learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; project to assess soil erosion and degradation in vineyards using geographical mapping systems and artificial intelligence (AI). ...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of Zig's compile-time execution features, also known as comptime. It outlines several areas where comptime may not provide the expected benefits or functionalities, such as dynamic memory allocation, extensive runtime interfaces, and certain type traits. The author emphasizes that while comptime is a powerful tool for optimizing and reducing runtime overhead, it has specific constraints that developers should be aware of when designing applications in Zig. The article aims to set realistic expectations about what comptime can achieve and encourages thoughtful use of the feature within its confines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744591"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes!To me, the uniqueness of Zig's comptime is a combination of two things:1. comtpime replaces many other features that would be specialised in other languages with or without rich compile-time (or runtime) metaprogramming, and2. comptime is referentially transparent [1], that makes it strictly "weaker" than AST macros, but simpler to understand; what's surprising is just how capable you can be with a comptime mechanism with access to introspection yet without the referentially opaque power of macros.These two give Zig a unique combination of simplicity and power. We're used to seeing things like that in Scheme and other Lisps, but the approach in Zig is very different. The outcome isn't as general as in Lisp, but it's powerful enough while keeping code easier to understand.You can like it or not, but it is very interesting and very novel (the novelty isn't in the feature itself, but in the place it has in the language). Languages with a novel design and approach that you can learn in a couple of days are quite rare.[1]: In short, this means that you get no access to names or expressions, only the values they yield.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quote in Spanish about a Norse god is from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, here's an English translation: https://biblioklept.org/2019/04/02/the-disk-a-very-short-sto...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;zig's comptime has some (objectively: debatable? subjectively: definite) shortcomings that the zig community then overcomes with zig build to generate code-as-strings to be lateron @imported and compiled.Practically, "zig build"-time-eval. As such there's another 'comptime' stage with more freedom, unlimited run-time (no @setEvalBranchQuota), can do IO (DB schema, network lookups, etc.) but you lose the freedom to generate zig types as values in the current compilation; instead of that you of course have the freedom to reduce-&gt;project from target compiled semantic back to input syntax down to string to enter your future compilation context again.Back in the day, where I had to glue perl and tcl via C at one point in time, passing strings for perl generated through tcl is what this whole thing reminds me of. Sure it works. I'm not happy about it. There's _another_ "macro" stage that you can't even see in your code (it's just @import).The zig community bewilders me at times with their love for lashing themselves. The sort of discussions which new sort of self-harm they'd love to enforce on everybody is borderline disturbing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744591</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various filmmaking mistakes and inconsistencies found in the movie "Revenge." It highlights specific scenes where continuity errors, prop misplacements, and logic gaps occur, analyzing how these mistakes can affect the viewer’s experience. The writer offers insights into how such errors often go unnoticed during production but become apparent upon closer examination, contributing to ongoing discussions about filmmaking quality and viewer expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Painting out these movie mistakes as part of a restoration is wrong. What's in the movie is in the movie, and altering the movie to this extent is a form of revisionist history. Cinema is worse off when over-aggressive restorations alter the action within the frame. To me, this is equivalent to swapping out an actor's performance with a different take, or changing the music score during an action sequence, or replacing a puppet creature with a computer graphics version of the same creature decades after release.It's really not the equivalent though. I don't see anything wrong with fixing a license plate or removing a reflection or a modern-day wristwatch.It's the equivalent of fixing a spelling error in a novel, or a wrong chord in sheet music. None of the filmmakers wanted those things there. They weren't done with intent. They were just mistakes.Changing music or replacing a puppet with CG, of course I'm against. That's changing the art of it. Different music makes you feel different. A CG creature has a different personality. Just like you don't want to replace vocabulary in a novel to make it more modern-day.I think it's usually pretty easy to distinguish the two. The first ones would have been corrected at the time if they'd noticed and gone for another take. They take us out of the movie if we notice them. The latter category is a reflection of the technology, resources, and intentional choices. They keep us in the world of moviemaking as it was at that time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure most people know the story. In the Twin Peaks pilot, a mirror reflection of a set dresser was briefly caught by the camera. Instead of editing this out of reshooting, David Lynch gave him a role in the show.Anyway, movies can have revisions. A movie is as much a commercial product as it is art. I don't see why people need to get all righteous about it, especially in cases where directors, actors, etc., don't care.Novels get revisions. Even fine art prints may have editions with differences between them. Old wood blocks by a famous artist may even be restruck decades later by a different person. They're still recognized as the piece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a really funny duality to mistakes in recorded art that is vastly different when viewed as a fan and the creator.As a music fan, I really love little mistakes in incredible albums. They’re humanizing, they show that the recording was made by people and it makes the highs feel so much higher.As an artist, I loathe mistakes in my own work and I will spend a basically limitless amount of time fixing annoying performance quirks in software — I’m talking things that I can do but didn’t get quite right — so I can listen to it without distraction or regrets. I know that nobody will notice these except me and the type of listener who does catch them will either not mind or appreciate it the way I would. But when it’s my own work, it’s different. I’m sure it’s the same for filmmakers so I understand the impulse to fix it later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745141</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a bunch of "weird" colors that we don't see naturally. Wikipedia has a page on them:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_colorSome can be created at home without any special equipment. For example, you can't mix red and green and create a "redgreen," but if you cross your eyes and have one eye see red and the other see green, you might see a new color you haven't seen before.I also see weird colors in displays with a high frame rate that cycle between colors quickly. And at one point, I had a laser shot in my eye, which destroyed part of my vision. Initially, in that spot, I saw a weird iridescent silver-greenish color I had never seen before. Although that was pretty cool, I wouldn't recommend repeating this involuntary experiment just to see that color.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This story makes me remember that I had heard a fun fact a long time ago that many people have never actually seen the colour "violet" which is a single wavelength of visible light. Because there are very few things that reflect only this wavelength in reality. The purple colour we see is formed from a mixture of red and blue, whether it's something in nature, screen displaying or printing. I was so intrigued that I bought a 405nm laser torch and invited some friends to a home party to ‘See the real violet’. That single wavelength of purple really made a different experience, and with good friends, we had a great day.The olo experiment was very interesting, and it told me that today we even have the technology to stimulate a single cone cell one by one in time. I know that we can't accurately display the olo on screen right now, which also prevents any of these articles from actually containing a picture of the olo. I think it's very close to #00FFEE, and I'm making it the colour of my Hacker News's top bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really fascinating to me. I'm amazed they're able to image the cells of the eye with sufficient resolution and speed to achieve this. From the paper, "and targeting 10^5 visible-wavelength laser microdoses per second to each cone cell.".If I understand correctly, they first use one type of spectroscopy (AO-OCT) to image the eye and build a map classifying the type of cells, and then use AO-SLO to find the positions of cells in real time. I assume that AO-OCT can't image at a sufficient rate for the second part (or they would just use one type?) so they need to first build this classification map, and then use it to match the position of cells to their type (e g., by overlaying the positions of cells with the classifications and making them line up).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43741013</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advancements and implications of several AI models, including OpenAI's Gemini 2.5 and Google's O3, as well as the concept of "jagged AGI," which refers to the uneven development and capabilities of artificial general intelligence. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these technologies in terms of their potential impacts on society, ethics, and the future of AI. The piece explores the distinctions between different models, their applications, and the broader conversation surrounding the future trajectory of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744173"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The capabilities of AI post gpt3 have become extraordinary and clearly in many cases superhuman.However (as the article admits) there is still no general agreement of what AGI is, or how we (or even if we can) get there from here.What there is is a growing and often naïve excitement that anticipates it as coming into view, and unfortunately that will be accompanied by the hype-merchants desperate to be first to "call it".This article seems reasonable in some ways but unfortunately falls into the latter category with its title and sloganeering."AGI" in the title of any article should be seen as a cautionary flag. On HN - if anywhere - we need to be on the alert for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro is certainly a tipping point for me. Previous LLMs have been very impressive, especially on coding tasks (unsurprising as the answers to these have a preponderance of publicly available data). But outside of a coding assistant, LLMs til now felt like an extra helpful and less garbage-filled Google search.I just used 2.5 Pro to help write a large research proposal (with significant funding on the line). Without going into detail, it felt to me like the only reason it couldn’t write the entire thing itself is because I didn’t ask it to. And by “ask it”, I mean: enter into the laughably small chat box the entire grant solicitation + instructions, a paragraph of general direction for what I want to explore, and a bunch of unstructured artifacts from prior work, and turn it loose. I just wasn’t audacious enough to try that from the start.But as the deadline approached, I got more and more unconstrained in how far back I would step and let it take the reins - doing essentially what’s described above but on isolated sections. It would do pretty ridiculously complex stuff, like generate project plans and timelines, cross reference that correctly with other sections of text, etc. I can safely say it was a 10x force multiplier, and that’s being conservative.For scientific questions (ones that should have publicly available data, not ones relying on internal data), I have started going to 2.5 Pro over senior experts on my own team. And I’m convinced at this point if I were to connect our entire research data corpus to Gemini, that balance would shift even further. Why? Because I can trust it to be objective - not inject its own political or career goals into its answers.I’m at the point where I feel the main thing holding back “AGI” is people’s audacity to push its limits, plus maybe context windows and compute availability. I say this as someone who’s been a major skeptic up until this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the last example (the riddle)--I generally assume the AI isn't misreading, rather that it assumes you couldn't give it the riddle correctly, but it has seen it already.I would do the same thing, I think. It's too well-known.The variation doesn't read like a riddle at all, so it's confusing even to me as a human. I can't find the riddle part. Maybe the AI is confused, too. I think it makes an okay assumption.I guess it would be nice if the AI asked a follow up question like "are you sure you wrote down the riddle correctly?", and I think it could if instructed to, but right now they don't generally do that on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744173</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular containers also happen to work great for testing dotfiles.Many years ago I added an install script to https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles to get set up in basically 1 command because I wanted a quick way to bootstrap my own system. I used the official Debian and Ubuntu images to test things.Over the last few days I refactored things further to support Arch Linux which has an official Docker image too.This enables being able to do full end to end tests in about 5 minutes. The container spins up in 1 second, the rest is the script running its course. Since it's just a container you can also use volume mounts and leave the container running in case you want to incrementally test things without wiping the environment.Additionally it lets folks test it out without modifying their system in 1 command. Docker has enabled so many good things over the last 10+ years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the idea of immutable Linux and bootable containers. My next project will probably be switching to bazzite. But I took a look at the Containerfile[1], and I have some big concerns about the fragility of their supply chain. It uses 20 different copr repos (granted, half are their own), and I didn't count how many packages. Best I can tell, none of the versions are pinned. They do dump a diff of all package versions in the release notes[2], but I wonder if anyone actually reviews it before release. All it takes is one vulnerability in one repo / package and you can enjoy your new cryptominer.There's something nice about running Debian and having confidence in all the packages because they're built and maintained by the Debian team. Of course there are exceptions, but in my experience they're rare. The only non-standard repo I regularly use is fish shell, and the updates are so few and far between (and very public) I think the risk is low.I suppose this isn't strictly a container-specific problem; you could add the repos and install / update all those packages yourself too. But being able to package everything up into a single file that you can then boot into as your OS means you're also packing all the supply chain risk.Curious if anyone else shares my concern or if I should just put my tinfoil hat back on...1. https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/Containerfile

&lt;p&gt;Turing Drawings is a project that allows users to create visual art using algorithms by leveraging Turing machines' computational capabilities. The repository includes code and resources for generating images based on specific rules and patterns, demonstrating how artistic expression can intersect with computer science. Users can customize parameters to produce unique drawings, engage with the underlying concepts of computation, and explore the creative potential of algorithmically generated art. The project is open-source, encouraging collaboration and experimentation within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of location tracking and privacy concerns associated with modern technology. It emphasizes how easily individuals can be tracked through various means, such as smartphones and social media. The article encourages readers to explore this phenomenon themselves by providing practical approaches and tools to understand their digital footprint and the extent to which their location can be monitored. Through hands-on experiments and awareness, the piece aims to inform readers about the vulnerabilities in their online privacy and the importance of being proactive in protecting their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

My biggest problem is how finnicky getting the rooted emulator plus apps is.My current flow for mitm and waydroid is here:
https://github.com/ddxv/mobile-network-trafficHope anyone has some advice!Edit: just want to mention that the OPs flow is definitely better for capturing real data and endpoints, but I didn't see how I could automate it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this topics comes up ever so often here, but this is really amazing demo. A reminder that on Android you can use tools like XPL-EX (previously XprivacyLua) to heavily block such calls and libraries, or something simpler even like something like [App Manager](https://muntashirakon.github.io/AppManager/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43716704</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article vaguely alludes to why this trend could appear but unfortunate it couldn't devote at least a paragraph to it. It's such an important issue, but given that this the industry impacted is considered small and niche it's so under discussed.Decades of political opposition toward any and all redevelopment of existing low density single family dominated residentially zoned areas has meant that practically all creation of new housing in the major cities of Canada has meant greenfield sprawl or for urban areas, creeping into brownfield redevelopment, rezoning old industrial areas into new condo developments.The problem with this is that the arts and gallery system has long relied on repurposing old and affordable industrial space into arts production space gallery and performance space. So what we've been seeing as the housing crisis has become more severe, is an increasing amount of destruction and rezoning of irreplaceable industrial land, aiding a shortage of industrial space, badly wanted by the Amazon's of the world too.So artists are being squeezed on both ends. The shortage of affordable housing is especially severe for low income working artists, and the political solution for solving this problem is to destroy the artist spaces which makes things more expensive for artists too.This could all be better fixed if we simply left industrial as industrial and actually allowed people to more intensively develop residential homes to meet our housing goals, and add more arts uses into residential areas (because let's be clear, everything mentioned in this article is likely on the down low, breaking municipal bylaws and Provincial liquor laws), but people have been incredibly resistant to this, no matter how much they claim to love the arts etc etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great that this is a trend. Its also a long tradition in contemporary art. I had my staircase and hallway as a gallery for a couple if years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744636</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Rust state machine pattern, detailing its purpose and how it can be effectively implemented in Rust programming. It explains the benefits of using state machines to manage state transitions in applications, highlighting clarity, maintainability, and error reduction. The author provides code examples to illustrate the pattern's implementation, emphasizing the advantages of Rust's type system in creating robust and efficient state management solutions. Additionally, the article touches on common pitfalls and offers tips for best practices in utilizing state machines in Rust development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit surprised that they don't use the name "type state". Perhaps it wasn't in wide use when this post was originally written?The important ideas here are that each state is moved in to the method that transitions to the next state. This way you're "giving away" your ownership of the data. This is great for preventing errors. You cannot retain access to stale state.And by using the From trait to implement transitions, you ensure that improper transitions are impossible to represent.It's a great pattern and has only grown in use since this was written.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand why you would code these explicit state machines when you can just write normal code that is much more readable. The state machine example they start with could be written as:  while (true) {
     wait();
     fill();
     finish();
  }

I don't think the approach from the article would have any benefits like less bugs or higher performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s funny seeing this blog post again. This is actually a reference I used to make a poker game as a state machine last year: https://github.com/theOGognf/private_pokerIt made the development feel a lot safer and it’s nice knowing the poker game state cannot be illegally transitioned with the help of the type system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43741051</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The document "The Era of Experience" from DeepMind discusses the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of experiential learning in the development of AI systems. It highlights how AI can benefit from rich interactions with complex environments, enabling agents to learn and adapt more effectively. The paper reviews the current state of AI research, explores the implications of experiential learning for various applications, and addresses challenges such as the need for safety and ethical considerations in AI deployment. The authors argue that fostering experiences will lead to more robust, generalizable, and human-aligned AI.&lt;/p&gt;

Great to know that we can expect agents that learn from experience very very soon!When they’re here I’ll make an upvote farming bot that learns from experience how not to get caught and unleash it on HM.After that I’ll make an agent that runs a SaaS company that learns from experience how to make money and I’ll finally be able to chill out and play video games.That last thing I’ll actually do myself, I won’t use an agent, although the experience revolution stared with games. Ironic!But I’ll make an agent that learns from experience what kind of games I like and how to make them. This way I’ll have an endless supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's ironic that machine intelligence is advancing during an era when human intelligence is declining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the resurgence of interest in retro robotics, specifically focusing on the Toy Armatron, and how it symbolizes a blend of nostalgia and modern advancements in AI and robotics. It highlights the evolution of robotic toys from simple mechanical designs to contemporary versions that integrate sophisticated technology, reflecting broader trends in robotics and artificial intelligence. The piece also explores the implications of this nostalgia-driven market and its influence on the future of toy design and consumer engagement with robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember saving birthday money and buying this at Radio Shack as a kid. It was pretty advanced for the time. Then I had the idea to try and make it remote controlled, or just fiddle with the internal electronics a bit. Joke was on me, there were no electronics, this thing was 100% mechanical. A single DC motor, and a fuck ton of gears that were engaged/disengaged by manipulating the two joysticks.This toy probably equally inspired kids to go into robotics, or to design automotive transmissions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would put the HERO (Heathkit Educational RObot) in both the same category and the era. [1]  HERO came with "an optional arm mechanism and speech synthesizer was produced for the kit form and included in the assembled form".  Huge influence on my own life.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERO_(robot)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ended up buying three of these as I was going to convert one to computer control. Last year at the ASVARO swap meet I sold the last one I had which had never been opened :-). The guy who bought it was pretty excited to have it (which is the goal of getting rid of one's junk right?)They were marvels. The only "practical" way to convert them was to put solenoids on the controls to drive them and it was impractical for any repeatable fine grain control. If I ever get a chance to meet the person behind that design I'd certainly buy them a round of their favorite beverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43718493</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent mathematical proof that resolves a long-standing question in the field of graph theory, specifically regarding connected networks. Researchers have established that certain conditions allow for the prediction of the structure and connectivity of complex networks, which has implications for various scientific fields, including biology and computer science. This proof not only settles a decades-old conjecture but also enhances our understanding of how networks operate, potentially influencing the study of social, biological, and technological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Either 31% or 69% is exceedingly common.Rare would be asymptotically few, or constant but smaller than e.g. 1 in 2^256.I guess the article covers it's working definition of common, ever so briefly:&gt;  that if you randomly select a graph from a large bucket of possibilities, you can practically guarantee it to be an optimal expander.So it's not a reliable property, either way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article reads as written by someone who just learned about graphs, it focuses so much on the bet and so less on explaining Ramanujan expanders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, I knew I recognized these from somewhere!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of providing the pharmaceutical company Provenix with a "barely adequate" pre-market approval for its products, suggesting that the current standards for drug efficacy and safety may be insufficient. It critiques the regulatory process and highlights concerns about the potential impact on public health and safety if such practices are accepted. The piece emphasizes the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that medications are effective and safe for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

But it did work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now seems to be the trend to bring TCP to retro machines from first principles.8088 PC's already have M Brutman's "mTCP" driver. And DogCow (D.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First off, this thread seems to bring out the most "reddit-like" posts on HN.
If you've come here to shoot a funny one-liner comment, please reconsider - the point is discussion, not karma farming.Now, on the topic itself - I really wonder about the safety profile of these. While this selectively inhibits only RARα and is thus "biased" towards mostly acting on testes, it could also have side-effects - and while the effect might not be pronounced yet, with long term use it definitely could be, especially if all the RARα receptors get inhibited (will beta and gamma pick up the slack? what is it going to cause?).Considering the 99% effectiveness claim and the method of action, I wonder if the embryos in that 1% case can even survive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was curious about the mechanism.https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00752-7&gt; YCT-529 works by interfering with vitamin A signaling necessary for sperm production and fertility.&gt; The importance of dietary vitamin A and retinoid signaling for male germ cell development and differentiation has been recognized for many years6. All trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 1a) is an active metabolite of vitamin A that exerts its function, at least partly, by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The RARs α, β, and γ, are encoded by the Rara, Rarb, and Rarg genes in mice, and Rarα and Rarγ have been validated as contraceptive targets by genetic knockouts resulting in male sterility7,8. Notably, the effects on spermatogenesis in the absence of RARα most resemble the loss of RAR signaling in vitamin A deficiency, and the mice are otherwise normal7,8. Further, the effects on spermatogenesis in animals treated orally with the dual RARα/RARγ antagonist BMS-189453 (Fig. 1a, b) closely phenocopied the absence of RARα function. Importantly, the resulting male sterility is reversible9,10,11. We, therefore, wished to identify RARα−selective inhibitors for potential male non-hormonal contraception. Our study describes the development of YCT-529, a highly selective RARα antagonist that reduces sperm counts in mice and non-human primates. Mating studies with male mice treated with 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks show that YCT-529 is 99% effective in preventing pregnancies and that the mice fully regain fertility after drug cessation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had alpha-blockers for a long time now, which prevents ejaculation but not orgasm; read: it can completely block the emission phase of ejaculation, while orgasmic function is retained.Example: Silodosin.You need to experiment with it. Sensitive clinical trials measured rates as high as 90-99%.It is entirely non-hormonal. It does not affect libido (rarely), while hormonal male contraceptives do, and it is reversible upon cessation, without any delay, unlike hormonal male contraceptives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745296</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses the concept of "falsify" in the context of software development, particularly in relation to the Haskell programming language and its type system. It explores the implications of using the `Falsify` type, which allows developers to create types that cannot inhabit a certain set, thereby providing a means to enforce stricter type safety and improving code reliability. The article highlights practical examples and use cases to illustrate how leveraging this concept can help in writing more robust Haskell applications, while also emphasizing the importance of understanding type systems in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, we just shrink the samples that feed into those generators.Besides that it seems like falsify has many of the same features like choice of ranges and distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fascinating!If I understand correctly, they approximate language of inputs of a function to discover minimal (in some sense, like "shortest description length") inputs that violate relations between inputs and outputs of a function under scrutiny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found in practice that shrinking to get the "smallest amount of detail" is often unhelpful.Suppose I have a function which takes four string parameters, and I have a bug which means it crashes if the third is empty.I'd rather see this in the failure report:("ldiuhuh!skdfh", "nd#lkgjdflkgdfg", "", "dc9ofugdl ifugidlugfoidufog")than this:("", "", "", "")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746017</guid></item><item><title>25.

For example, we know that LLMs encode concepts through rotations (but not magnitude) of several neurons.Bringing this up because the abstract (and the mention of rotations) reminded me of recent LLM interpretability posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The OP looks like good work, but it's definitely not a quick read. The authors claim theoretical breakthroughs that enable:* a data-free LLM quantization method which they claim outperforms all prior data-free approaches, including NF4; and* a method which they claim is optimal for finding non-uniform per-layer quantization levels which match a given compression constraint in the "medium bitwidth" regime.They demonstrate improved accuracy-compression trade-offs on popular LLMs.Thank you for sharing this on HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744343</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the relationship between attention spans, learning capabilities in mathematics, and the effects of storytelling on those spans. It emphasizes that while individuals may have varying attention spans, engagement through narrative can enhance concentration and understanding in subjects like math. The author explores strategies to maintain attention and interest through storytelling techniques, suggesting that weaving mathematical concepts into stories can make them more relatable and easier to grasp. Overall, the piece highlights the importance of narrative in education, particularly in enhancing focus and facilitating learning in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found something similar to be true when it comes to building.Some years ago, John Collison tweeted that he realized everything he saw in the built environment had once been someone’s passion project.I think there’s another, maybe more interesting way to say it, which is that everything built embodies a story both in how its internal parts relate to each other, and how those parts relate to the rest of the world, say, the humans who use a building.I realized this watching my 6yo, who loves stories, place each new Lego brick into a building or vehicle and explain what it contributed, and how it would be useful. The bricks were stuck together with explanations.Talking about this later with a friend who does design, he made me see that this is what design is. And that the stories change after the object is built, as the humans bring new needs and expectations to objects. Everything is its own Gestalt and the Gestalt is dynamic over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What’s really needed is more story-focused content between basic number sense and undergraduate level math. YouTube channels like Numberphile (particularly Tadashi Tokieda’s episodes that explore curious toys) are a fantastic invitation. More could exist in various forms, particularly those that transition from these delightful introductions to deeper, more complete theories while still holding on to the stories. The closest I’ve found for young children is the comic book series Beast Academy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone familiar with Murderous Maths?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43709843</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;JuryNow is a digital platform designed to connect legal professionals with a pool of jury members for trial simulations and jury research. The service aims to enhance the trial preparation process by allowing attorneys to conduct mock trials and gather feedback, thus aiding in the development of effective legal strategies. Users can easily create juries based on specific demographics and access detailed insights from the participants to better understand how cases might be received in an actual courtroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Jury, I would give a "skip question" option. I found one relating to Christianity that I had _no_ idea what the "correct" answer would be based on the two options.I thought clicking "Ask a new question" then going right back into Jury Duty would give me a new question, but I landed on the same one.I think the asker providing the two valid responses is flawed. It doesn't allow the "jury" to draw their own conclusion, or provides leading answers (one about "is it rude" to eat by themselves when they're socially exhausted in a work context -- one is "yes they would be offended", the other "no they won't be" -- well, they certainly may be but it is your right to eat alone, so the answer could have been "they may, but you need to take care of yourself").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, fun. Suggestion:I really miss not seeing the results.After answering several questions, I really wanted to see what the final jury decision was. I saw a question from a father asking about leaving his assets to his children. I would want to know what the other 11 random people selected (for various reasons).Without this feature, I think I might start to lose interest because it'll start to feel like I'm clicking into the empty, voiceless void.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm using Firefox on Android. For me, it showed a question and two answers, but all attempts to select an answer failed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745554</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of decomposing transactional systems into smaller, more manageable components. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying architecture of these systems to enhance scalability, maintainability, and performance. By breaking down complex transactional processes, organizations can improve their ability to adapt to changing requirements and optimize system interaction. Key techniques for decomposition are outlined, along with practical considerations and examples to guide developers in effectively implementing these strategies in their own systems.&lt;/p&gt;

So maybe I'm supposed to consider this post only for 'Every transactional system' running with SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation. I don't particularly care about that. I do care that the database I use clearly states what its isolation names mean in detail and that it does exactly what it says. e.g. I don't expect MySQL SERIALIZABLE to exactly mean the same as any other database that uses the same term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746461</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses OpenAI's recent acquisition of the windsurfing website, Windsurf, highlighting the strategic move as part of OpenAI's broader efforts to integrate advanced technologies into recreational and sports domains. It explores the implications of this purchase for both the tech industry and the windsurfing community, emphasizing how OpenAI plans to leverage its AI capabilities to enhance user experiences and promote the sport. The piece provides insights into the potential for innovation in sports through technology while also addressing community concerns about commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why couldn’t OpenAI vibe code their own Windsurf/Cursor competitor? (Serious question).OpenAI is a technology company constantly in search of productization (ChatGPT, Sora, Dall-e), and they’ve been really good at creating product interest that converts to acquisition. An IDE is much more complex than a chat app, but given their literal billions of dollars and familiarity with developer tooling, this is a down-stack build that they could dogfood off their own tech. And especially given that some of these tools were built by tiny teams (Cursor is what, 10 people?), is this like Google and Facebook’s implicit admission that they can’t “build and grow” anymore, and need to turn to acquisitions to fuel growth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few thoughts:1) I agree that the moat for these companies is thin. AFAICT, auto-complete, as opposed to agentic flows, is Cursor's primary feature that attracts users. This is probably harder than the author gives it credit for; figuring out what context to provide the model is a non-obvious problem - how do you tradeoff latency and model quality? Nonetheless, it's been implemented enough times that it's mostly just down to how good is the underlying model.2) Speaking of models, I'm not sure it's been independently benchmarked yet, but GPT 4.1 on the surface looks like a reasonable contestant to back auto-complete functionality. Varun from Windsurf was even on the GPT 4.1 announcement livestream a few days ago, so it's clear Windsurf does intend to use them.3) This is probably a stock deal, not a cash deal. Not sure why the author is so convinced this has to be $3B in cash paid for Windsurf. AFAIK that hasn't been reported anywhere.4) If agentic flows do take off, data becomes a more meaningful moat. Having a platform like Cursor or Windsurf enables these companies to collect telemetry about _how_ users are coding that isn't possible just from looking at the repo, the finished product. It opens up interesting opportunities for RLHF and other methods to refine agentic flows. That could be part of the appeal here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Some are better at the auto complete (Copilot), others at the agent flow (Claude Code). Some aim to be the best for non-technical people (Bolt or Replit), others for large enterprises (again, Copilot). Still, all of this "differentiation" ends up making a 1-2% difference in product. In fact, I can't stress enough how much the UX and core functionality of these tools is essentially identical.Is this exclusively referring to the ux or full functionality?Because I can tell you straight away that cursor (Claude) vs copilot is not a 1% difference. Most people in my company pay their own cursor license even though we have copilot for available for free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43743993</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Adversarial Examples for Generative Models" explores the concept of generating adversarial examples to improve the robustness of generative models, particularly focusing on generative adversarial networks (GANs). It discusses the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks and proposes methods to generate adversarial samples that can enhance the training process. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments, revealing how adversarial examples can help in developing more resilient generative models and improve performance in various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Presumably they had some code that looped until they found a prime that gave them all the right properties, but it would be good if they shared that process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the industry pivoting towards focussing on post-quantum algorithms, I’d be surprised if yet another elliptic curve gains much traction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why this over Curve448 and Ed448.

Like I understand if this is a technical demo and there is a LOT of Fortran code, but...?I've actually had to do this with a couple of different Fortran projects when I was in college, I translated them to C for various reasons.Maybe it's because it was specifically code written by scientists (i.e somewhat brute force and very straightforward) but there really wasn't very many features that I can recall that didn't have a direct C counterpart, other than column major ordering and arrays staring at 1.Was I just blissfully unaware?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft demoed a version of their GraphRAG that translated C code to (I believe) mostly idiomatic Rust, and it ran without errors.I tried to find reference to how they did it, does anyone know?It sounds like this approach of translating old code could help speed up teams that are looking at rewrites. I also have some old code that's in Kotlin that I'd like to move to something else. I had a bad NullPointerException take down my application after missing a breaking change in a Kotlin update.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good idea. I'd much rather write   do concurrent (i = 1:n) 
     y(i) = y(i) + a*x(i)
   enddo

and then let the a compiler translate it into    std::transform(par, x, x+n, y, y,
      [=](float x, float y){ return y + a*x; }
    );

if C++ is required for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43710220</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; An interesting debate emerged about the necessity of checking every possible error:&gt; In JS world this could be true, but for Rust (and statically typed compiled languages in general) this is actually not the case… GO pointers are the only exceptions to this. There are no nil check protection at compile level. But Rust, kotlin etc are solid.Yes it actually is the case. You cannot check/validate for every error, not even in rust. I recommend getting over it.For a stupid-simple example: You can't even check if disk is going to be full!The disk being full is a real error you have to deal with, and it could happen at any line in your code through no fault of your own, and no it doesn't always happen at write() but can also when you allocate pages for writing (e.g. SIGSEGV). You cannot really do anything about this with code- aborting or unwinding will only ever annoy users, but you can do something.We live in a multitasking world, so our users can deal with out-of-disk and out-of-memory errors by deleting files, adding more storage, closing other (lower priority) processes, paging/swapping, and so on. So you can wait: maybe alert the user/operator that there is trouble but then wait for the trouble to clear.Also: Dynamic-wind is a useful general-purpose programming technique awkward to emulate, and I personally dislike subclassing BackTrack from Error because of what can only be a lack of imagination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common Lisp has retries in addition to exceptions. Retry works almost the same way as exception except it allows exception handler to restart execution from the place it happened. I wish we have this in modern widespread languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JS aside, I recently tried my very best to introduce proper logging and error handling to otherwise "look ma, no handlebars" codebase.Call it a thought experiment. We start with a clean implementation that satisfies requirements. It makes a bold assumption that every star in the universe will align to help us achieve to goal.Now we add logging and error handling.Despite my best intentions and years of experience, starting with clean code, the outcome was a complete mess.It brings back memories when in 2006 I was implementing deep linking for Wikia. I started with a "true to the documention" implemention which was roughly 10 lines of code. After handling all edge cases and browser incompatibilites I ended up with a whooping 400 lines.Doing exactly the same as the original lines did, but cross compatible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746229</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;TikZJax is an integrated tool designed to facilitate the creation and rendering of LaTeX-based graphics within web applications. It leverages the power of the TikZ package, allowing users to generate high-quality vector graphics using LaTeX syntax. The website provides detailed documentation on installation, usage, and customization options, enabling developers to seamlessly incorporate TikZ graphics into their projects. Additionally, it supports real-time rendering and offers examples to demonstrate various features and capabilities. Overall, TikZJax aims to enhance the accessibility and usability of LaTeX graphics for web development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jim Fowler seemed like Calculus' biggest hype man when the MOOC ball was just starting to roll. If you're looking to brush up and like the more energetic/engaging style I'd recommend checking out his videos on YouTube or elsewhere.&gt; Using web2js, the Pascal source of tex is compiled to WebAssembly; the latex format is loaded (without all the hyphenation data), and [...] is executed. Then core is dumped; the resulting core is compressed, and by reloading the dumped core in the browser, it is possible to very quickly get to a point where TikZ can be executed. By using an SVG driver for PGF along with dvi2html, the DVI output is converted to an SVG.This is the kind of hack I'm here for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny seeing this on the front page – I'm coding a project as I'm browsing this that makes heavy use of TikZJax.Overall, I'm impressed by how seamlessly it works when it does work. But it's not perfect:- Some core library functions (for example, most types of fill patterns) simply don't work or aren't implemented for some reason.- There are a few long-standing bugs. For instance, if using the intersections library to compute the intersection of a line and a circle, it straight-up crashes the entire TikZJax process. Intersections of two lines or two circles are fine, but circle+line fails. My attempts at diagnosing this seem to indicate that it's running out of stack space, so maybe the original TikZ code uses some inefficient recursive algorithm to compute this intersection, and this exceeds some stack size limit that the WebAssembly version introduces. I'm not sure and I haven't been able to get much traction.- The project doesn't seem to get any love from the original developers anymore. I've filed multiple bugs for months now that never get any form of acknowledgement.- The build process is pretty convoluted and difficult to reproduce (to try to fix those aforementioned bugs myself), which I guess is what you'd expect from a project that attempts to cross-compile a 20-year-old macro package for a 50-year-old Pascal codebase for rendering in the browser.Overall I'm very glad TikZJax exists and there's still no better-looking and convenient-to-author diagramming language than TikZ itself. But there's definitely rough edges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While live rendering is nice, I suppose that generating static SVGs that are embedded in a static webpage generator are more fruitful for the typical case. A quick search yielded this: https://polbarrachina.com/2022/05/23/latex-and-tikz-in-jekyl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746831</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing focus as a skill is something I see with every batch of new students. It’s not just LLMs, almost every app and startup is competing for the same limited attention from every user.What LLMs have done for most of my students is remove all the barriers to an answer they once had to work for. It’s easy to get hooked on fast answers and forget to ask why something works. That said, I think LLMs can support exploration—often beyond what Googling ever did—if we approach them the right way.I’ve seen moments where students pushed back on a first answer and uncovered deeper insights, but only because they chose to dig. The real danger isn’t the tool, it’s forgetting how to use it thoughtfully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using aimbot in Gunbound didn't make players better. Yes, it changed everything: it destroyed the game ecosystem.Can humanity use "literacy aimbot" responsibly? I don't know.It's just a cautionary tale. I'm not expecting to win an argument. I could come up with counter anectdotes myself:ABS made breaking in slippery conditions easier and safer. People didn't learned to brake better, they still pushed the pedal harder thinking it would make it stop faster, not realizing the complex dynamics of "making a car stop". That changed everything. It made cars safer.Also, just an anecdote.Sure, a lot of people need focus. Some people don't, they need to branch out. Some systems need aimbot (like ABS), some don't (like Gunbound).The future should be home to all kinds of skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Search enginers offer a good choice between Exploration (crawl through the list and pages of results) and Exploitation (click on the top result).
LLMs, however, do not give this choice.I've actually found that LLMs are great at exploration for me. I'd argue, even better than exploitation. I've solved many a complex problem by using an LLM as a thought partner. I've refined many ideas by getting the LLM to brainstorm with me. There's this awesome feedback loop you can create with the LLM when you're in exploration mode that is impossible to replicate on your own, and still somewhat difficult even with a human thought partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744394</guid></item><item><title>38.

Our organization (SVISA) was started by a group of techies in the SF Bay area to save local ice rinks. Here's some more info on our STEM Ice event &amp; group:www.robotsonice.orgwww.sv-isa.orgIf this interests you, join our mailing list, swing by, or dm me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a figure skater and AI engineer, that venn diagram of my life doesn't often overlap.That was an interesting paper but I'm confused as to what they actually tried to achieve. I'm also confused how they achieve any turning in a model that has infinite friction on one side and zero friction on the other. My brain is having trouble understanding how such a model could ever achieve anything other than a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43717403</guid></item><item><title>39.

MCP is inherently designed so integrating something like oAUTH is going to be very difficult. What callback url are you going to use? How are you going to pass the token in so it isn’t stored by the LLM provider? Etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744116</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The AI Skeptic's Guide to AI Collaboration" discusses the importance of critical thinking and skepticism regarding artificial intelligence collaborations. It highlights the potential risks and ethical considerations that come with AI technology, urging a cautious approach to its development and implementation. The guide aims to equip readers with the necessary tools to evaluate AI projects and interact within AI ecosystems intelligently, advocating for transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in the face of rapid technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of the same kind of skill goes into prompting AI and delegating work to other humans. Delegation requires building intellectual empathy for the task recipient, giving them an instruction they can verifiably follow. It requires building trust, and more often than not requires a certain degree of trial/error/watching others work before one can delegate reliably. A lot goes into delegation, and much of this stuff is hard! It's also hard to be delegated to -- especially by someone you haven't worked with before, what is it that they mean when they ask for "more sparkles in the UI" or "I tried C and it didn't work"? Can I guess their background to meet them where they are? The list goes on.In some ways it's easier to delegate to an AI because you don't have to care for anyone's feelings but your own, and you lose nothing but your own time when things don't go well and you have to reset. On the other hand, when the delegation does not go well, you still got yourself to blame first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's surprising to me that these things are so hard to use well. If you asked me before ChatGPT to guess how the user experience with this kind of technology would be, I would have said I expect it to be as intuitive as talking, almost no friction. I think this is a natural expectation that, when violated, turn a lot of people off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; illustrative 30-day calendar of exercisesThat there is such a calendar for using ChatGPT in the style of topics like "how to eat healthy", "how to stay fit" or "how to be more confident" shows to me more than anything what impact AI has on our society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43741655</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Slouching Towards San Francisco" discusses the author's observations and experiences relating to the cultural and political shifts occurring in San Francisco. It reflects on the challenges the city faces, including issues such as housing affordability, homelessness, and urban policy, while also exploring the changing dynamics of its communities and the implications of these transformations. The piece mixes personal anecdotes with broader societal commentary, highlighting both the beauty and the struggles of life in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stories like this are fun and I think they resonate well with a lot of people, but unfortunately the details are actively harmful cynicism that ignore fact that would ruin the narrative.Look around San Francisco today. What has changed recently?
Crime is way down, lower than it has been in 15 years.
Homelessness is down, lower than the past 4 years.Did tech companies decide to start paying more taxes? Did the city start spending more? No, the actual cause is boring and simple, but makes anti-establishment folks very uncomfortable.The truth is that our government started operating more effectively, intentionally trying to solve problems that it previously pretended were insoluble. This change was instigated by a relatively small number of rich people where were fed up and decided to and spend their own money to fix the city.Some other nitpicks I have with the sentiment expressed in the article:* Police and firefighters in SF make more on average than tech workers. Is that a source of injustice? Or is unequal pay more complicated? Is inequality only bad when the groups benefitting are aesthetically undesirable to you?* SF remains one of the highest tax cities in the country, and is the highest in the Bay Area. At the margin, businesses are leaving (including Twitter, mentioned in the article). Raising more taxes on these businesses seems unlikely to increase revenue long term.* We spent more per resident on most services than nearly every other city in the country. Aren't you curious why that is, and doesn't it seem like understanding that problem would lead to insights more interesting than "tech bad"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Both the city’s public school system and transit systems are crumbling and underfunded, and its housing and homelessness crises remain existential.Some quick googling indicates that SF has something like 3x the per capita city budget as San Jose, a city in the same metro area with similar average rent (according to Zillow). If its city departments manage to still be underfunded in spite of that, something is deeply wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I unexpectedly moved here two years ago from ChicagoI was going to say, this sounds like it was written by someone who wasn’t around during 2012-2016. Aside from AI not much is new.&gt; A tech crash wouldn’t just mean a higher unemployment rate; it would also devastate local businesses and public services. Empty offices, empty coffee shops around those offices, empty balance sheets for coffee beans, and so on.This already happened with COVID and remote work. The city was overflowing with tech hype and industry to support it 10 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43743915</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be blunt, I think this blog post highlights everything that's wrong with Internet discourse today (and in 2013) :1. First, make a bold assertion (i.e. that an average person commits three felonies a day) and provide absolutely zero evidence for this, or even an example of what those felonies are. Sure, this blog post references a book that I'm assuming has more info, but given that "vague, overbroad laws" are the central thesis of this blog post, the author should at least give some examples or evidence of what he's referring to. "Lie with citations", where you make a claim, and with a referenced link, but that link only has a tangential relationship with your claim, is all too common online.2. The post brings up the example of Joseph P Nacchio's prosecution with a telling that is clearly one-sided and doesn't even entertain the possibility that he committed serious crimes. I absolutely believe it was possible he was prosecuted for his decision to push back against the NSA, but I'm certainly not going to believe it from this blog post. The Wikipedia article on Joseph Nacchio states "Nacchio claimed that he was not in a rightful state of mind when he sold his shares because of problems with his son, and the imminent announcement of a number of government contracts." So it seems clear to me he at least admitted that some of his stock sales were improper.What I think is even more assinine is that the one single example, a CEO who was prosecuted for insider trading, absolutely does not support the assertion that the average person commits 3 felonies a day, or that laws are overbroad. I'm quite sure I've never made any equity transactions that could be considered insider trading, so my empathy for this situation is low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For such a short book review I feel like they could have listed out one or two example felonies that people likely commit each day. Feels like a weird tease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. Speeding over the speed limit can be a crime. I haven't ever driven in the US and not noticed that pretty much everyone around me is over-speeding2. Failing to pay tax on certain gifts can be a crime&gt; You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at least equal value in return. If you sell something at less than its full value or if you make an interest-free or reduced-interest loan, you may be making a gift. [1]3. If you are reading Hacker News on end instead of working for your employers who pays you, you could be stealing from them, a felony.4. Jay-walking can a misdemeanor, and open to interpretation. Commit 3 misdemeanors and you could have committed a felony.5. More examples come to mind[1] https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43742859</guid></item><item><title>46.

What's that supposed to mean? Was this vibe-coded?Edit: The article has since been edited to disclaim "values are not encrypted realistically" - sure, use small numbers for demonstration purposes etc., but what is being demonstrated here? You've added scare-quotes to "encrypted" but what is the actual intended meaning?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The form y^2 = x^3 + bx + c prohibits intuition and probably follows from the general form for an algebraic expression: ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ...The whole idea of an algebraic expression is to relate x and y (for 2D). What's the simplest relation?y/x = r =&gt; we have a straight line with slope r. Let's add a bit more detail.(y-b)/(x-a) = r =&gt; we shift the origin to (a,b) and check how the line looks.These relations can also get "self-aware". This is similar to how a rate of change can be self-aware (ex: d/dx f(x) = x). The rate of water drain out from a tap at the bottom of the water tank would depend on the water height which itself affected by the drain out. Something like that.(y-b)/(x-a) = x =&gt; That is a "self-aware" relation, because we replaced r (a constant) with the variable x. So we have a parabola now.Let's change gears a bit. we will use higher degree for variablesy^2/x^2 = r =&gt; For positive values of r, we have a pair of straight lines.Now, ((y-a)(y-b))/((x-c)(x-d)) = r =&gt; What happened? we get a conic.Let's make it self-aware((y-a)(y-b))/((x-c)(x-d)) = x =&gt; There it is. A cubic equationDigging deeper, we see that the self-awareness makes the curve to bring the left-side parts to join at finite distance rather than at negative infinity. To understand this, consider the pair of straight lines (y^2/x^2 = r). You might see that it is a pair of straight lines crossing each other. But you can also look at two sharply bent lines touching each other at a point. a conic has a bit smoother turn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me this article was not nearly deep enough for me to understand elliptical curve cryptography. What I learned was the equation of an elliptical curve and that it is used in cryptography, the rest was inscrutable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43742722</guid></item><item><title>47.

The guy claims he is a US citizen, but I bet you a lot of illegal immigrants without documentation claim they are a US citizen as well.Also there is no federal ID system, so how do you go about  confirming if this person is a US citizen or not? It does seem reasonable that people within ICE custody should get the chance to call someone so that person can bring identification for ICE to confirm the identity, and that is maybe the missing part which lead to this situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745469</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that a significant drought was a key factor behind the British rebellion against Roman legions during the first century AD. The study highlights how environmental stressors, like prolonged dry spells, affected agricultural productivity and led to social unrest and resistance against Roman rule. The findings suggest that understanding historical climate impacts can provide insights into societal changes and conflicts in the past, illuminating the relationship between environmental conditions and human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article "Getting Forked by Microsoft" discusses the author's experience with Microsoft’s software and services, detailing frustrations with bugs, poor customer support, and the challenges of navigating their ecosystem. It emphasizes the author's journey of dealing with technical issues and the feeling of being overwhelmed by ongoing changes and updates. The post critiques Microsoft’s approach to software development and user experience, highlighting the importance of user feedback and the desire for better alternatives in the tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In distant times (before Microsoft's Satya era) I was the maintainer of a popular OSS product that scratched an important itch for specialist people who were doing work in the early cloud days. It solved my own problems, and I didn't want to make a business out of it, so I was content to release it as OSS.A Microsoft director who ran a portfolio of product teams reached out to ask about a "collaboration". I said I'd be happy to send them my consulting agreement. There was a little grumbling about the rate but I just reiterated that it was my rate. After a lot of legal back and forth, they signed, I answered a bunch of questions for them in a 2-day workshop, and they paid.If they want you badly enough, they'll pay. Don't work for free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi Philip, I'm Lachlan from the Cloud Native Ecosystem team at Microsoft. Our team works in the cloud native open-source community with a goal of being great open-source collaborators in these projects and communities, and I’m sorry that this happened.We appreciate your leadership and collaboration on Spegel and see your project solving a real challenge for the cloud native community. I wanted to thank you for your blog post https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/, let you know what we’re doing, and address a few points.We’ve just raised a pull request https://github.com/Azure/peerd/pull/110 amending the license headers in the source files. We absolutely should have done better here: our company policy is to maintain copyright headers in files – we have added headers to the files to attribute your work.I also wanted to share why we felt making a new project was the appropriate path: the primary reason peerd was created was to add artifact streaming support.  When you spoke with our engineers about implementing artifact streaming you said it was probably out of scope for Spegel at that time, which made sense. We made sure to acknowledge the work in Spegel and that it was used as a source of inspiration for peerd which you noted in your blog but we failed to give you the attribution you, that was a mistake and I’m sorry. We hear you loud and clear and are going to make sure we improve our processes to help us be better stewards in the open-source community.Thanks again for bringing this to our attention. We will improve the way we work and collaborate in open source and are always open to feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of blame being assigned to Microsoft, the entire corporation.  But I doubt this was a heavily contemplated decision by a room full of executives, or voted on by the shareholders.More likely, this is a way for someone to get ahead in their career at Microsoft by passing off a successful open source project as their own accomplishment.  They can steal users from the original project and justify using Microsoft's resources to maintain it, which puts more resources under their control, and gives them something to talk about during performance reviews.The open source community should have a way to enforce professional consequences on individuals in situations like this.  They are motivated by professional gains after all.  That's the only way this will stop happening.  Professional consequences does not mean doxxing or other personal attacks, it means losing career opportunities, losing contributor privileges, and becoming known as untrustworthy.  These consequences have to be greater than the expected gain from passing a project off as your own at work.I wonder if a new kind of license could be created which includes projects in some kind of portfolio and violating the license means losing access to the entire portfolio.  Similar to how the tech companies added patents to a shared portfolio and patent treachery meant losing access to the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43750535</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of "T" strings in Python, a new feature that simplifies the process of formatting strings with named placeholders. It explains how T strings allow developers to easily incorporate variables and expressions directly within the string without the need for cumbersome formatting methods. The author provides examples of how T strings can enhance code readability and maintainability, while also addressing potential use cases in real-world applications. Overall, the piece highlights the significance of this new feature in improving Python's string handling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All things considered, this is pretty cool. Basically, this replaces    db.execute("QUERY WHERE name = ?", (name,))

with    db.execute(t"QUERY WHERE name = {name}")

Does the benefit from this syntactic sugar outweigh the added complexity of a new language feature? I think it does in this case for two reasons:1. Allowing library developers to do whatever they want with {} expansions is a good thing, and will probably spawn some good uses.2. Generalizing template syntax across a language, so that all libraries solve this problem in the same way, is probably a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In addition, I hope that the tooling ecosystem will adapt to support t-strings. For instance, I’d love to see black and ruff format t-string contents, and vscode color those contents, if they’re a common type like HTML or SQL.This is such a strange take on t-strings. The only way for anything to infer that the template string is supposed to turn into valid HTML or SQL is to base it of the apparent syntax in the string, which can only be done in an ad-hoc fashion and has nothing to do with the template string feature.The way the feature has been designed there is no indication in the string itself what type of content it is or what it will eventually be converted to. It’s all handled by the converting function.As others have added, something like sql”select * from {table}” would have been able to do this, but there’s not even any guarantees that something that is in a template that will be converted into valid sql by a converting function should be any type of valid sql prior to that conversion.  For all you know t“give me {table} but only {columns}” might be a converted into valid sql after the template is processed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will this allow neat SQL syntax like the following?    city = 'London'
    min_age = 21
    # Find all users in London who are 21 or older:
    users = db.get(t'
        SELECT * FROM users
        WHERE city={city} AND age&gt;{min_age}
    ')

If the db.get() function accepts a template, it should, right?This would be the nicest way to use SQL I have seen yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43748512</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of pipelining in computer architecture, explaining it as a technique that allows overlapping of instruction execution to improve processing efficiency and throughput. It outlines how pipelining divides tasks into smaller stages, enabling multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously, and highlights its impact on performance by reducing latency. The piece also examines potential hazards that can occur during pipelining, such as data dependencies and control hazards, along with strategies to mitigate these issues, ultimately illustrating the importance of pipelining in modern computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43751076"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author keeps calling it "pipelining", but I think the right term is "method chaining".Compare with a simple pipeline in bash:  grep needle &lt; haystack.txt | sed 's/foo/bar/g' | xargs wc -l

Each of those components executes in parallel, with the intermediate results streaming between them.  You get a similar effect with coroutines.Compare Ruby:  data = File.readlines("haystack.txt")
    .map(&amp;:strip)
    .grep(/needle/)
    .map { |i| i.gsub('foo', 'bar') }
    .map { |i| File.readlines(i).count }

In that case, each line is processed sequentially, with a complete array being created between each step.  Nothing actually gets pipelined.Despite being clean and readable, I don't tend to do it any more, because it's harder to debug.  More often these days, I write things like this:  data = File.readlines("haystack.txt")
  data = data.map(&amp;:strip)
  data = data.grep(/needle/)
  data = data.map { |i| i.gsub('foo', 'bar') }
  data = data.map { |i| File.readlines(i).count }

It's ugly, but you know what?  I can set a breakpoint anywhere and inspect the intermediate states without having to edit the script in prod.  Sometimes ugly and boring is better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm personally someone who advocates for languages to keep their feature set small and shoot to achieve a finished feature set quickly.However.I would be lying if I didn't secretly wish that all languages adopted the `|&gt;` syntax from Elixir.```params|&gt; Map.get("user")|&gt; create_user()|&gt; notify_admin()```&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lisp macros allow a general solution to this that doesn't just handle chained collection operators but allows you to decide the order in which you write any chain of calls.For example, we can write:
(foo (bar (baz x))) as
(-&gt; x baz bar foo)If there are additional arguments, we can accommodate those too:
(sin (* x pi) as
(-&gt; x (* pi) sin)Where expression so far gets inserted as the first argument to any form. If you want it inserted as the last argument, you can use -&gt;&gt; instead:(filter positive? (map sin x)) as
(-&gt;&gt; x (map sin) (filter positive?))You can also get full control of where to place the previous expression using as-&gt;.Full details at https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43751076</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor force participation of mothers with young children in the United States. It analyzes changes in employment and childcare dynamics during the pandemic, highlighting how disruptions in schooling and childcare availability disproportionately affected mothers. The findings indicate a significant decline in labor force participation for mothers, particularly those with younger children, and emphasize the need for policies to support working mothers in post-pandemic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe many of the problems in our current social media landscape could be solved by eliminating the "feed" and instead displaying posts, updates, and pictures from friends, family, and those we know in real life. This approach might conflict with the profit models of big tech social media and could go against what most people have become accustomed to. Personally, I would love a smaller social network where I can stay connected with my school friends, college friends, and distant family without having to see irrelevant posts, like some stupid remark from a politician halfway around the world or influencers doing something outrageous just for attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before its fall, I had over 700 followers on Twitter. I could post any random thought and within minutes be having an interesting conversation with some rando about it. For example I pondered why phone manufacturers didn't use a p2p protocol for distributing updates and had an enlightening conversation with a person who worked for a major telco chiming in as to why that would be problematic for their infrastructure.This was my biggest source of joy on the modern internet.When the walls fell and everybody left, I dropped 200 followers to 500 but by X's own metrics no one sees my tweets. I would estimate between 13 and 20 is my average view count. When I do post, I am lucky a single person interacts, and it is almost always someone I know in the real world.I have presences on Mastodon and Bluesky, but my follower count on both remains in the low teens. I don't think the market is there anymore for "dude that ponders technology questions". I tweet like it's 2010 and no one cares anymore.This was the death of social media for me. This was the last place I was really "social" on the internet and it died.Genuinely this has had a very negative effect on me, the only somewhat of a silver lining is that I now have these conversations with ChatGPT. It's not as much fun though.Instagram is just brainrot these days. I'd used it for years to post my absolute best photos as a sort of curated gallery. No one cares anymore. Nothing I post ever gets seen. Why bother.That sums up my general opinion of all social media these days, why bother.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm certainly an anomaly but since to me the downsides of social media have always been quite prominent and seemed to outweigh the benefits by a margin, I never jumped on the social media train.But I've got to say, it's getting harder and harder to keep that up. As our kids get older especially, almost all of their social activities are somehow tied to social media one way or the other: no matter what they're joining, minimally there's a WhatsApp group. My wife has reluctantly joined WhatsApp and if it wasn't for that, it feels like we would pretty much be destined to become social outcasts.In one recent instance, we weren't even aware of a parent group for one of our children's school class until someone asked us (in person!) why we didn't come bowling the previous night. We had no idea, and no-one sees the necessity to include someone who - for whatever reason - is not on WhatsApp.I can see the argument that we are inconveniencing others by not wanting to be reachable to what has now become a standard means of being in touch, and that we cannot expect others to jump through hoops just to include us. But a few years back, I was quite deeply involved in privacy research and I definitely feel no inclination to share all of my communications (and pictures) with Meta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43748486</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository by Lukas Ogunfeitimi focuses on reverse engineering the TikTok application to understand its inner workings and data flow. It includes various tools and scripts that assist in analyzing TikTok's features, network interactions, and underlying architecture, aiming to provide insights for developers and researchers interested in app security, data privacy, and behavior analysis. The project is intended to foster learning and collaboration in the field of software analysis and reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using a shitty streaming website whose player interrupts the playback of a video in irregular intervals and presents a cryptic error message. I've started looking into the JavaScript code to see if I can't code up a work-around mechanism (basically debugging their garbage implementation), and of course (why actually?) their player code is also obfuscated.And I've gotta say, emplying an AI assistant has proven to be an invaluable help in trying to understand obfuscated code. It's actually really cool to take a function of gobbledegook JavaScript and ask the AI to rewrite it in a more canonical and easily understandable way, with inline comments. Of course, there are flaws every now and then, but the ability to do this has been such a game changer for reverse engineering, IMO.I can even ask to take a guess at finding better variable/function names and the AI can infer from the code (maybe has seen the unobfuscated libraries during training?) what this code is actually doing on a high-level and turn something like e.g(e.g) into player.initialize(player.state) which is nothing short of amazing.So for anyone doing similar work, I cannot recommend highly enough to have an AI agent as another tool in your tool belt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As this is a Javascript file executed on the web, it is actually possible to replace the normal webmssdk.js with the deobfuscated file and use TikTok normally.&gt; This can be achieved by using two browser extensions known as Tampermonkey for executing custom code and CSP to disable CSP so I can fetch files from blocked origins. This is so I can put latestDeobf.js in my own file server and have it be fetched each time, this is so I can easily edit the file and let the changes take effect each time I refresh. This makes it much easier to bebug when reversing functions.I believe you can achieve the same effect without any 3rd party extensions. You can use Local Overrides in Chrome DevTools.Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like quite a lot of work to hide the code. What would the legitimate reasons for this be? Because it looks like it would make the program less optimized and more complexity just leads to more errors.I understand the desire to make it harder for bots, but 1) it doesn't seem to be effective and bots seem to be going a very different route 2) there's got to be better ways that are more effective. It's not like you're going to stop clones through this because clones can replicate by just seeing how things work and reverse engineer blackbox style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747921</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux added a busy polling feature for high performance networking. Most Linux software does not use it, but software used in datacenters (e.g. by CDNs) that does use it makes the system very energy inefficient when things are not busy. This patch gives the the kernel the ability to turn that off when not busy to regain energy efficiency until things become busy again.The article name is somewhat misleading, since it makes it sound like this would also apply to desktop workloads. The article says it is for datacenters and that is true, but it would have been better had the title ended with the words “in datacenters” to avoid confusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I didn’t see mentioned here yet: a lot of high-performance data center workloads don’t actually go through the Linux kernel’s network stack at all.Instead, they use DPDK, XDP, or userspace stacks like Onload or VMA—often with SmartNICs doing hardware offload. In those cases, this patch wouldn’t apply, since packet processing happens entirely outside the kernel.That doesn’t mean the patch isn’t valuable—it clearly helps in setups where the kernel is in the datapath (e.g., CDNs, ingress nodes, VMs, embedded Linux systems). But it probably won’t move the needle for workloads that already bypass the kernel for performance or latency reasons. So the 30% power reduction headline is likely very context-dependent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a more detailed look at this change: https://lwn.net/Articles/1008399/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43749271</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against Uber for alleged deceptive billing and cancellation practices that misled consumers. The investigation revealed that Uber charged fees inappropriately and did not adequately inform users about the costs associated with canceling rides. The agency's complaint asserts that these practices violated consumer protection laws, prompting the FTC to seek remedies to stop Uber's misleading conduct and ensure greater transparency in their billing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest dark pattern in all these apps is that they will mess up your order/ride and then "refund" you in the form of account credit. There's no way to actually get your money back. Trying to contact support results in an endless loop of help screens and chatbots. If you are able to figure out the magic combination of options that will get you to a support agent they will say "sure we will refund your money" but that is still only going to your app account. The last time I had an issue I literally had to ask them 3 times "I want you to confirm that you are refunding my credit card the amount it was charged" for them to finally agree to it. It is crazy what they can get away with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  &gt; Users can be forced to navigate as many as 23 screens and take as many as 32 actions to cancel. 

I complain about dark patterns _a_lot_ but this one takes the cake!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uber is an interesting company in that they were always shady, but initially in ways that customers liked (somewhat illegal taxis ripping off their drivers, for below cost, subsidized lifestyle by VC).They then flipped the "make a profit" switch and are now shady in ways customers dislike (ripping you the customer off).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43754274</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experience of hosting a blog on a Nintendo Wii, detailing the technical challenges and solutions involved in setting up the website. It covers the unique aspects of using a gaming console for web hosting, including server configuration, software choices, and the limitations of the hardware. The author highlights the nostalgic and creative aspects of using the Wii in this unconventional way, while also providing insights and tips for others interested in similar projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unaware, the "SSL Added and removed here!" image is a reference to a diagram describing unencrypted communications between Google datacenters that leaked from the NSA in 2013 [1].[1] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/new-docs-show-ns...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the coolest revelations to me, just looking at the status page [1] is that the Wii only had 88 MB of RAM - split between 24 MB built in to the SoC and 64 MB of GDDR3.Given that this is the case, ntpd using 15% of the system memory means it was using about 13 MB of RAM - hardly a huge chunk by today's standards but not small either. I wonder if reducing the number of time servers would improve this much? On my system I can see I'm tracking about 9 servers from the debian pool.Compare this to the XBox 360 which even at the time had 512 MB, it's really amazing how much they managed to squeeze out of such a tiny chip.[1] - https://blog.infected.systems/status/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of a project I saw more than 24 (!) years ago.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of large language models (LLMs) on programming, suggesting that they function more like mechanical suits enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing human programmers entirely. It argues that LLMs provide tools that increase productivity and creativity but do not possess true understanding or consciousness. The author emphasizes the collaborative potential of LLMs in software development, highlighting their role in augmenting human skills rather than supplanting them, and encourages programmers to leverage these technologies as assistants in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Traditionally, coding involves three distinct “time buckets”:&gt;    Why am I doing this? Understanding the business problem and value&gt;    What do I need to do? Designing the solution conceptually&gt;    How am I going to do it? Actually writing the code&gt; For decades, that last bucket consumed enormous amounts of our time. We’d spend hours, days or weeks writing, debugging, and refining. With Claude, that time cost has plummeted to nearly zero.That last part is actually the easiest, and if you're spending inordinate amount of time there, that usually means the first two were not done well or you're not familiar with the tooling (language, library, IDE, test runner,...).There's some drudgery involved in manual code editing (renaming variable, extracting functions,...) but those are already solved in many languages with IDEs and indexers that automate them. And so many editors have programmable snippets support. I can genuinely say in all of my programming projects, I spent more time understanding the problem than writing code. I even spent more time reading libraries code than writing my own.The few roadblocks I have when writing code was solved by configuring my editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started my career as a developer in the 1990s and cut my teeth in C++, moving on to Python, Perl, Java, etc. in the early-2000s. Then I did management roles for about 20 years and was no longer working at the “coal face” despite having learned some solid software engineering discipline in my early days.As an old geezer, I appreciate very much how LLMs enable me skip the steep part of the learning curve you have to scale to get into any unfamiliar language or framework. For instance, LLMs enabled me to get up to speed on using Pandas for data analysis. Pandas is very tough to get used to unless you emerged from the primordial swamp of data science along with it.So much of programming is just learning a new API or framework. LLMs absolutely excel at helping you understand how to apply concept X to framework Y. And this is what makes them useful.Each new LLM release makes things substantially better, which makes me substantially more productive, unearthing software engineering talent that was long ago buried in the accumulating dust pile of language and framework changes. To new devs, I highly encourage focusing on the big picture software engineering skills. Learn how to think about problems and what a good solution looks like. And use the LLM to help you achieve that focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The developers who thrive in this new environment won’t be those who fear or resist AI tools, but those who master them—who understand both their extraordinary potential and their very real limitations. They’ll recognise that the goal isn’t to remove humans from the equation but to enhance what humans can accomplish.I feel like LLMs are just the next step on the Jobs analogy of "computers are bicycles for the mind" [0]. And if these tools are powerful bicycles available to everyone, what happens competitively? It reminds me of a Substack post I read recently:&gt; If everyone has AI, then competitively no one has AI, because that means you are what drives the differences. What happens if you and LeBron start juicing? Do you both get as strong? Can you inject your way to Steph’s jumpshot? What’s the differentiator? This answer is inescapable in any contested domain. The unconventionally gifted will always be ascendant, and any device that’s available to everyone manifests in pronounced power laws in their favor. The strong get stronger. The fast get faster. Disproportionately so.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This service is pretty much what I, a software developer, am scared off. I expect that it will be used in order to quickly cobble something together and then hand it over to a dev for "polishing". And this sounds like a total nightmare to me.If used like that, this service will effectively turn my job into that of an assistant to a machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't normally comment on these things, but I gave it a quick shot for a project I'm working on (fairly generic dashboard-style prompt, but that's fine).I'm actually pretty impressed. A couple things though:1. It took a _while_ to give me anything. Not sure if that's related to load, but it was ~17 files, and probably took 5+ minutes. It was not clear what was going on in that time, or what would happen if I left it. I literally left my machine to go something else before coming back.2. I really hate saying this, but your pricing is probably way too low, especially at the "pro" level from your pricing page. When stepping into team-based config management and pre-sets, you're leaving a ton of money on the table without enterprise-style custom value-based pricing. If you were asking me, I would recommend moving the team based features (shared presets, custom access control, etc) into an "enterprise" level above pro).I'm not going to comment on any sort of "correctness" as far as any complex UX behaviours or workflows; I'm only considering this from a mockup/design/demo-of-new-ideas perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did you manage to advertise or generate initial traffic for something like that?Even if the tool is excellent, it seems like the space is flooded with “Prototype your app with AI” tools, many backed by big players with huge ad budgets.
The target audience must be getting bombarded with a dozen similar pitches every day. How did you manage to cut through the noise?I find myself asking this question often, so there’s probably something fundamental I don’t quite grasp about startups in general.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43752176</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also recommend an insightful talk by the author of the article, delivered at a Chaos Computer Club (CCC) event (GPN, Gulaschprogrammiernacht) on this topic. Unfortunately, it's only available in German, but it's definitely worth watching:
https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn22-382-kein-kinoerlebnis-ohne-korr...„No cinema experience without correct certificate management... A look behind the scenes of a cinema with a digital projector system, how distributors deliver films to cinemas with end-to-end encryption, and how films are protected from piracy. In addition to an overview of projector technology, the presentation will demonstrate the file format and manual decryption of film data.“Edit: I just realized that the author of the article also delivered the recorded talk, adapted my comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, asdcplib author here (mentioned in the article.) Excellent writeup of DCP and related tech. FYI the colorspace of an SDR DCP MXF file is X'Y'Z' with gamma 2.6 (see SMPTE 428-1.) Other MXF formats (i.e., not cinema) use a wide variety of colorspaces. Despite the huge range of XYZ, DCP image files are usually constrained to code values that fall within P3 (again, SDR.) The HDR applications are more interesting.Upon reading the comments: • DCP is a B2B format. DCP usage is licensed by contract, not EULA. Please keep these important differences in mind when commenting on DRM. • Decrypt, decode, color processing, watermark occurs in FPGA. If you think that sounds hard, remember that all of this tech was originally deployed 20 years ago. Moore's law has made our lives much easier since! • Frame-by-frame encipherment, rather than whole stream, better supports random access and the famous tobacco intermissions popular in the EU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even with all of this onerous encryption and DRM, it's not hard to find pirated copies of movies. It makes me think that the sacrifice in ownership rights for the theaters over their equipment isn't worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745281</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the verification process for the Bluesky social media platform, detailing how users can obtain verification badges. It outlines the criteria for verification, including authenticity, activity level, and community contributions.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got verified in the initial round of verification.On a technical level, this sort of works like a Root CA: anyone can verify anyone by publishing a `app.bsky.graph.verification` record to their PDS. Bluesky then chooses to turn those from trusted accounts into the blue check, similar to browsers bundling root CAs into the browser.* https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/app.... &lt;- bluesky verifying me. it's coming from at://bsky.app, and therefore, blue check* https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:3danwc67lo7obz2fmdg6jxcr/app.... &lt;- me verifiying people I know. it's coming from at://steveklabnik.com, and therefore, no blue check.I am not 100% sure how I feel about this feature overall, but it is something that a lot of users are clamoring for, and I'm glad it's at least "on-protcol" instead of tacked on the side somehow. We'll see how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.How is this compatible with Bluesky's internal cultural vision of "The company is a future adversary"[1][2][3]?  With Twitter, we've seen what happens with the bluecheck feature when there's a corporate power struggle.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35012757

"Trusted Verifiers" - how does the bsky team decide which orgs can be trusted? One could argue that this is worse than Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution and implications of AI-assisted search technologies, particularly focusing on how they enhance information retrieval and user experience. It examines the potential benefits, such as improved accuracy and efficiency in finding relevant content, while also addressing concerns around bias, misinformation, and the impact on traditional search practices. The author emphasizes the need for careful consideration of these factors as AI continues to shape the landscape of search engines and information access.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most impressive demos of these tools always involve technical tasks where the user already knows enough to verify accuracy. But for the average person asking about health issues, legal questions, or historical facts? It's basically fancy snake oil - confident-sounding BS that people can't verify. The real breakthrough would be systems that are actually trustworthy without human verification, not slightly better BS generators. True AI research breakthroughs would admit uncertainty and provide citations for everything, not fake certainty like these tools do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The various deep research products don't work well for me.  For example I asked these tools yesterday, "How many unique NFL players were on the roster for at least one regular season game during the 2024 season?  I'd like the specific number not a general estimate."I as a human know how to find this information.  The game day rosters for many NFL teams are available on many sites.  It would be tedious but possible for me to find this number.  It might take an hour of my time.But despite this being a relatively easy research task all of the deep research tools I tried (OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity) completely failed and just gave me a general estimate.Based on this article I tried that search just using o3 without deep research and it still failed miserably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is surprising. o3 produces incredible amount of hallucinations for me, and there are lots of reddit threads about it. I've had to roll back to another model because it just swamps everything in made up facts. But sometimes it is frighteningly smart. Reading its output sometimes feels like I'm missing IQ points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43752262</guid></item><item><title>17.

It highlights the tactics employed by the government to intimidate and deter individuals from participating in political activism or expressing dissenting opinions.

Thailand’s use of lèse-majesté has been both arbitrary and prolific; protesters can be arrested for as little as sharing social media posts that are ‘insulting to the monarchy’. Furthermore, the weaponization of lèse-majesté has devastating consequences: those convicted under Section 112 face three to 15 years in prison per count.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chilling. Governments weaponizing information they have on citizens is textbook dystopian. The lack of oversight on social media platforms that allows this to happen is incompetence at best, and complicity at worst.As more governments slip into autocracies, similar scenarios are likely happening in other countries as well, and we just don't know about it. The fact that US social media platforms are operated by people supportive of an aspiring autocrat should be a red flag for anyone still using them. Especially for citizens of the US, where the line between the government and corporations gets thinner by the day.These are truly bizarre and frightening times for anyone outside of this system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thai authorities can also arrest and jail you if you leave bad reviews on Google maps. If you visit Thailand it's best not to say anything but positive things about the country on social media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747242</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "layered design" in software architecture, emphasizing its effectiveness in creating modular and maintainable systems. It outlines the benefits of separating concerns into distinct layers, which can enhance the clarity of application structure and facilitate easier updates and debugging. The author highlights the importance of defining clear interfaces between layers and recommends best practices for implementing layered design, ultimately advocating for better organization of code to improve development processes and reduce complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, not allowing circular dependencies is a great design choice for building large programs. It forces you to separate your concerns properly.If you get a circular dependency something is wrong with your design and the article does a good job on how to fix them.I sometimes use function pointers which other packages override to fix circular dependencies which I don't think was mentioned in the article.My only wish is that the go compiler gave more helpful output when you make a circular dependency. Currently it gives a list of all the packages involved in the loop  which can be quite long, though generally it is the last thing you changed which caused the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;great blog post! also this website has a lot of incredible posts, if you like learning about functional programming, you should check outhttps://jerf.org/iri/blogbooks/functional-programming-lesson...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One bonus technique related to the “move to a third package” advice: generating many of your model structures (SQL, Protobuf, graphql, etc) allows you to set up obvious directionality between generated layers and to provide all generated code as “base packages” to your application code, which then composes everything together.Prior to this technique we often had “models importing models circularly” as an issue but that’s entirely disappeared due to the introduction of the structural additional layer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43740992</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Minimizing loss over aggregates is what a statistical model is designed to do, so if you evaluate human judgment against statistical predictions in aggregate on data similar to what the model was trained on, then you should expect statistical prediction to winThis reminds me of the many years machine translation was evaluated on BLEU towards reference translations, because they didn't know any better ways. Turns out that if you measure translation quality by n-gram precision towards a reference translation, then methods based on n-gram precision (such as the old pre-NMT Google translate) were really hard to beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is not a human-explainable reason a model has made a prediction - and it's just a statistical blob in multi-dimensional feature space (which we cannot introspect) perceived improvement over humans is simply overfitting. It will be extremely good at finding the median issue, or following a decision tree in a more exacting way than a human. What a human can do is expand the degrees of freedom of their internal model at-will, integrate out of sample data, and have a natural human-bias to the individual at the expense of the median. I'd rather have that...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are a few ways to look at this from the standpoint of information that is available to the decision-maker. One is that human knowledge is valuable for guiding developing the model, but once you have a statistical model, it’s a better aggregator of the information. This is echoed by research on judgmental bootstrapping (https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1974-dawes.pdf), where a statistical model trained on a human expert’s past judgments will tend to outperform that expert.By the way, note that this applies to LLMs too. One of the biggest pons asinorums that people get hung up on is the idea that "it just imitates the data, therefore, it can never be better than the average datapoint (or at least, best datapoint); how could it possibly be better?"Well, we know from a long history that this is not that hard: humans make random errors all the time, and even a linear model with a few parameters or a little flowchart can outperform them. So it shouldn't be surprising or a mystery if some much more complicated AI system could too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43736172</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses tabular programming, which emphasizes the organization of data in tables to streamline programming tasks and enhance efficiency. It highlights the advantages of using tabular formats for coding, including improved readability, ease of data manipulation, and the ability to leverage various programming libraries. The author provides practical examples and insights into how tabular data structures can be implemented in different programming languages, thereby promoting a more structured and systematic approach to coding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; this tabular programming environment isn't just about cramming programming capabilities into a Game Boy-like device. It's about rethinking programming from the ground up for a specific hardware context. (...)&gt; By rethinking how programming can work within tight hardware constraints, we might discover new approaches that actually enhance rather than limit creative expression.This speaks to me. As a software engineer, I work with abstractions all day, and it is impossible for me to fully understand the system that I'm building. I often think I would be much happier if I worked on a product that I could actually understand from top to bottom and know all the details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of ladder diagrams from industrial control systems—not because of the domain, but because both emphasize a linear, visually structured flow of logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some random thoughts, might be interesting (or not).Some things that really do fit into tables, where there's no empty fields in the rows:- Relational databases- Hardware circuit truth tables- Assembly language opcodes- FPGA compiler output- Matrix multiplication. Or some GPU programs
e.g. if you want to have a conditional statement using multiply-add, then 'if (cond) then x1 else x2' would be 'out = (cond * x1) + (cond * x2)'.Those things have good performance in one way or another. But it's not easy to make all the application logic fit into a table-based schema.e.g. Why does someone choose a python web server framework which sends and receives JSON. It's really super easy to extend and add something without knowing what you'll need in advance.But if you try to fit that into a table, you'll have to change the table schema for everything to try to best fit what the program does right at the moment. And then if there's one new extra complex or long-running function, it will never easily fit the same schema as the others. You'll have to break the big function down into some smaller common operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43751168</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In general, defensive tactics and puzzles are underrepresented in chess literature and resources.I play a lot of puzzles (Storm) on Lichess, and this hits hard. I can spot good attacks, but not good defences because it’s vastly underrepresented in my training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That second X-ray defense only works because the white rook is protected by the white queen from above. If that weren't there, the black queen takes rook.The point is valid that defense lines do not stop at enemy pieces in the current board configuration. They are "X ray" because they look forward to a future board position where some opponent's piece has moved out of the way (perhaps staying in that line of attack, susceptible to being taken).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43721853</guid></item><item><title>25.

It discusses the emotional and cultural complexities surrounding the adoption of these children, highlighting the experiences of both the adoptees and their adoptive families.

I’m well aware of families who didn’t know there were additional steps to perform and often wonder what agencies failed their due diligence in guiding them through that process. Enough people screwed up that it seems absurd to deny citizenship to those who would otherwise have it.My representative is adopted and has adopted and he’ll be receiving a letter encouraging his support of allowing citizenship for these adoptees that missed it through no fault of their own.That said, as an adoptive parent this is a common trope - ignore the millions of successful adoptions to focus on those that are horrific. Cast parents as baby smugglers with fiendish intent. I’m sure those people exist, but as a parent in this community for almost 14 years, I’ve met untold families excited to provide for the needs of a child who has already experienced significant trauma. No adoption exists without loss. We can, at best, try to mend what’s already been done.Fortunately, for us, the process for citizenship was laid out - also complicated and nerve racking. There were no conditions (except for us as parents and sponsors).My love for my children is unconditional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first experience learning about Operation Babylift was being traumatized by the Christmas episode of Hey Arnold. It's a fascinating situation, saving babies that have no parents because of your actions as a country.I don't like that this article was written in such a negative light. I am sure there were terrible situations, but also, you simply wouldn't be writing about a Vietnamese orphan that died on the street without ever being sent to adoptive parents. It feels a bit biased to treat this as an overall negative action by the US. I have met several Babylift adoptees living in SF, and I think they would voice dissenting opinions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43752532</guid></item><item><title>30.

We may use your Log and Usage Information and Prompts and Outputs Information for this purpose.https://windsurf.com/privacy-policyAm I the only one bothered by this? Same with Gemini Advanced (paid) training on your prompts. It feels like I’m paying with money, but also handing over my entire codebase to improve your products. Can’t you do synthetic training data generation at this point, along with the massive amount of Q/A online to not require this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor and Windsurf pricing really turned me off. I prefer Claude Code's direct API costs, because it feels more quantifiable to me cost wise. I can load up Claude Code, implement a feature, and close it, and I get a solid dollar value of how much that cost me. It makes it easier for me to mentally write off the low cost of wasteful requests when the AI gets something wrong or starts to spin its wheels.With Cursor/Windsurf, you make requests, your allowed credit quantity ticks down (which creates anxiety about running out), and you're trying to do some mental math to figure out how those requests that actually cost you. It feels like a method to obfuscate the real cost to the user and also create an incentive for the user to not use the product very much because of the rapidly approaching limits during a focus/flow coding session. I spent about an hour using Cursor Pro and had used up over 30% of my monthly credits on something relatively small, which made me realize their $20/mo plan likely was not going to meet my needs and how much it would really cost me seemed like an unanswerable question.I just don't like it as a customer and it makes me very suspicious of the business model as a result. I spent about $50 on a week with Claude Code, and could easily spend more I bet. The idea that Cursor and Windsurf are suggesting a $20/mo plan could be a good fit for someone like me, in the face of that $50 in one week figure, further illustrates that there is something that doesn't quite match up with these 'credit' based billing systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried Windsurf for the first time last week, and I had pretty mixed results.  On the positive side, sometimes the tool would figure out exactly what I was doing, and it truly helped me.  This was especially the case when when performing a repetitive action, like renaming something, or making the same change across multiple related files.Most of the time though, it just got in the way.  I'd press tab to indent a line, and it'd instead jump half-way down the file to delete some random code instead.  On more than one occasion I'd by typing happily, and I'd see it had gone off and completely mangled some unrelated section without my noticing.  I felt like I needed to be extremely attentive when reviewing commits to make sure nothing was astray.Most of its suggestions seemed hyper-fixated on changing my indent levels, adding braces where they weren't supposed to go, or deleting random comments.  I also found it broke common shortcuts, like tab (as above), and ctrl+delete.The editor experience also felt visually very noisy.  It was constantly popping up overlays, highlighting things, and generally distracting me while I was trying to write code.  I really wished for a "please shut up" button.The chat feature also seemed iffy.  It was actually able to identify one bug for me, though many of the times I'd ask it to investigate something, it'd get stuck scanning through files endlessly until it just terminated the task with no output.  I was using the unlimited GPT-4.1 model, so maybe I needed to switch to a model with more context length?  I would have expected some kind of error, at least.So I don't know.  Is anyone else having this experience with Windsurf?  Am I just "holding it wrong"?  I see people being pretty impressed with this and Cursor, but it hasn't clicked for me yet.  How do you get it to behave right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43755321</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's transition from Python to Haskell, highlighting the differences between the two programming languages and the unique features that Haskell offers. The author emphasizes Haskell's strong type system, functional programming paradigms, and the benefits of immutability and higher-order functions. Additionally, they share personal experiences and challenges faced while learning Haskell, including the steep learning curve and the joy of mastering new concepts. The piece ultimately advocates for exploring Haskell as a valuable addition to a programmer's skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This idea comes from a functional pearl called "Power Series, Power Serious" [0], which is well worth reading.I implemented the same thing myself in F#. [1][0]: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;d...[1]: https://github.com/brianberns/PowerSeries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely unrelated, but there’s a Haskell-like syntax for Python: https://web.archive.org/web/20241205024857/https://pyos.gith...  f = x -&gt; raise if
    x :: int  =&gt; IndexError x
    otherwise =&gt; ValueError x

Complete with pipelines, of course:  "&gt; {}: {}".format "Author" "stop using stale memes"
    |&gt; print&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like this idea too. Generators are one of my favorite parts of Python — super memory efficient, and great for chaining transformations. But in practice, I’ve found they can get hard to reason about, especially when you defer evaluation too much. Debugging gets tricky because you can’t easily inspect intermediate states.When working with other engineers, I’ve learned to be careful: sometimes it’s better to just materialize things into a list for clarity, even if it’s less “elegant” on paper.There’s a real balance between cleverness and maintainability here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43728056</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of adding keyword parameters to Tcl procedures (procs) to enhance flexibility and readability in coding. It explains the benefits of using keyword arguments, such as reducing errors and improving code maintainability. The author provides examples and practical tips for implementing keyword parameters in Tcl, highlighting how they can simplify function calls and make the code more self-documenting. Additionally, it addresses common challenges and offers solutions to ensure smooth integration into existing Tcl scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a search of the Tcl wiki shows, attempts to add named-argument capability to the Tcl proc command have been around for several years.My own nxproc extension is more comprehensive. (See wiki [0].)The extension enables named arguments, regular positional arguments, and 'rest' arguments, nxargs and nxunknown. Nxproc also provides (optional) type-checking of procedure arguments. (Types: string, number, bool and enumerated. Enums are lists of values restricting what the arg can contain.)Nxproc supports TclOO with nxcontructor and nxmethod commands -- same feature set as "plain" nxproc. Also provides case-insensitive '-ci' variants, and runtime display of named-argument default/actual values and types.Nxproc is a Tcl C extension. Bundle has Windows, Linux binaries. Compiles easily on other platforms.[0] https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/nxproc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The OpenACS web server toolkit has a lot of useful Tcl utilities, including the ad_proc procedure, which wraps proc and allows adding of switches, inline docs, and more.I think it would be very useful to turn ad_proc into a built-in command and incorporate it into TCL.https://nstcl.sourceforge.net/docs/nstcl-core/ad_proc.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I implemented something very similar a while ago, it's indeed too bad it's not built-in. I don't think you need such a "quasiquote" function, [list {*}$args] can escape a single command, and then it's a matter of joining multiple commands using a newline. IIRC that's how I did it.I also had further fun with wrapping "proc" by implementing a "pyproc" which called out to Python while looking like a normal Tcl proc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43754004</guid></item><item><title>33.

F.

At least for radio interferometry. Maybe Optical has smaller scale?The positional accuracy of fixed point RF interferometers in astronomy are amazing, they can probably measure continental drift (only joking) -So this is saving atmospheric attenuation but with very small angular distance between the arms of the interferometer.Surely this has to go up to km and 100 of km to be useful? Maybe not in optical.(the Narrabri Radio Telescope is a giant radio interferometer on a linear railway track. The SKA is fixed position,  massive deployments "Square Kilometer" hence the name.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you know how hard it is to align an interferometer on an optical table, where things are BOLTED to it, this looks absolutely insane.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43756723</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Go Arenas," a concept that revolves around creating interactive spaces for community engagement and activities. It explores the importance of such arenas in fostering collaboration and innovation among diverse groups. The piece highlights various examples of successful arenas, outlines best practices for designing these spaces, and emphasizes the role of technology in enhancing user experiences. Ultimately, it advocates for the development of more arenas to promote social interaction and collective problem-solving in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been doing some performance tuning in Go lately to really squeak performance, and ended up with a very similar arena design except using byte slices for buf and chunks instead of unsafe pointers.  I think I tried that too and it wasn't any faster and a whole lot uglier, but I'll have to double check before saying that with 100% confidence.A couple other easy wins -if you start with a small slice and find some payloads append large amounts, write your own append that preemptively is more aggressive in cap bumping before calling the builtin append.unsafe.String is rather new and great for passing strings out of byte slices without allocating.  Just read the warnings carefully and understand what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting stuff! For folks building off-heap or arena-style allocators in Go—how do you usually test or benchmark memory safety and GC interactions in practice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is a fun read.If you enjoyed this, or if you need more control over some memory allocations in Go, please have a look at this package I wrote. I would love to have some feedback or have someone else use it.https://github.com/fmstephe/memorymanagerIt bypasses the GC altogether by allocating its own memory separately from the runtime. It also disallows pointer types in allocations, but replaces them with a Reference[T] type, which offers the same functionality. Freeing memory is manual though - so you can't rely on anything being garbage collected.These custom allocators in Go tend to be arena's intended to support groups of allocations which live and die together. But the offheap package was intended to build large long-lived datastructures with zero garbage collection cost. Things like large in-memory caches or databases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43756871</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of control groups (cgroups) in Linux kernel version 6.1, which enhance how system resources are managed and allocated to processes. It highlights improvements in cgroupv2, such as a more user-friendly interface and better support for hierarchical resource management, which enables finer-grained control over CPU, memory, and I/O resources. Additionally, the article details the benefits of these changes in terms of system performance and resource utilization, and it addresses potential use cases, making a case for cgroups as essential for modern workloads and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joplin is really nice feature-wise but the last time I looked at it a few years back I absolutely HATED the way that it structured your notes.The way it worked was that they stored new/existing notes in an SQLite table with UUIDs. This of course makes it very difficult to use bash tools, other IDEs, etc. to work with your notes after Joplin has ingested them.Further the related media was renamed "UUID.&lt;related extension&gt;" which were stored in `~/.config/joplin-desktop/resources`.Compare this to apps like VS Code / Obsidian / Logseq (also open source) which don't mess with your markdown file organization. You can just point them to a root folder and they'll work natively with your markdown files. No syncing required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really surprised I don't see more tech-savvy people talking about SilverBullet (https://silverbullet.md). It's not perfect, but very "hackable" and being actively developed. It's the best self-hostable note taking app I've found so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used Joplin daily for years. The only thing I _REALLY_ wish they did was allow you to just store and display notes as plain text.Instead, there is always either markdown or rich text formatting involved. And there's no ability to disable that.That always seemed odd to me to force that kind of decision on users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734732</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of local inference for Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the advantages of running these models on personal devices rather than relying on cloud services. It highlights the potential benefits, including enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and independence from network connectivity. The author explores various technical approaches and considerations for optimizing performance, such as hardware requirements and model selection, and underscores the growing trend of utilizing powerful LLMs locally to empower users while keeping their data secure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yikes what's the bar for dead simple these days? Even my totally non-technical gamer friends are messing around with ollama because I just have to give them one command to get any of the popular LLMs up and running.Now of course "non technical" here is still a pc gamer that's had to fix drivers once or twice and messaged me to ask "hey how do i into LLM, Mr. AI knower", but I don't think twice these days about showing any pc owner how to use ollama because I know I probably won't be on the hook for much technical support. My sysadmin friends are easily writing clever scripts against ollama's JSON output to do log analysis and other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TFA seems to miss a lot of things.Mac's unified memory makes them (price-) compelling over x86 with GPU(s) for large models, say something over 24-32 GB.  But a 32GB Mac doesn't take advantage of that architecture.(IIRC by default you can use 66% of RAM in &lt; 32GB Metal boxes, and something higher in &gt; 32GB -- though you can override that value via sysctl.)Macs can also run mlx in addition to gguf, which on these smaller models would be faster. No mention of mlx, or indeed gguf.The only model tested seems to be a distil of Deepseek R1 with Qwen - which I'd have classified as 'good, but not great'.Author bemoans all quants of that are &gt; 5GB, which isn't true. Though with 20GB of effective VRAM to play with here, you wouldn't want to be using the Q4 (at 4.6GB).Author seems to conflate the one-off download cost (time) from hf with on-going performance cost of using the tool.No actual client-side tooling in play, either, by the looks of it, which seems odd given the claim that local inference is 'not ready as a developer platform'.The usual starting point for most devs using local LLMs is   vscode + continue.dev , where the 'developer experience' is a bit more interesting than just copy-pasting to a terminal.Criterion (singular) for LLM model expertise appears to be 'text to SQL', which is fair enough if you were writing about applicability of "Local LLM Inference For Text to SQL".  I'd have expected the more coding-specific (qwen2.5 coder 14B, codestral, gemma?) models would be more interesting than just one 6GB distil of R1 &amp; Qwen.Huggingface has some functional search, though https://llm.extractum.io/list/ is a bit better in my experience, as you can tune &amp; sort by size, vintage, licence, max context length, popularity, etc.I concur that freely available can-run-in-16GB-of-RAM models are not as good as Claude, but disagree that the user experience is as bad as painted here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download the model in background. Serve the client with an LLM vendor API just for the first requests, or even using that same local LLM installed on your own servers (likely cheaper). By doing so, in the long run the inference cost is near-zero and allows to use LLMs in otherwise impossible business models (like freemium).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43753890</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wholly agree. Too often we think about scale far too early.I've seen very simple services get bogged down in needing to be "scalable" so they're built so they can be spun up or torn down easily. Then a load balancer is needed. Then an orchestration layer is needed so let's add Kubernetes. Then a shared state cache is needed so let's deploy Redis. Then we need some sort of networking layer so let's add a VPC. That's hard to configure though so let's infra-as-code it with terraform. Then wow that's a lot of infrastructure so let's hire an SRE team.Now nobody is incentivized to remove said infrastructure because now jobs rely on it existing so it's ossified in the organization.And that's how you end up with a simple web server that suddenly exploded into costing millions a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was shat on multiple times by throbbing-brain architecture guys for this, but what I've done multiple times that worked in prod, was to start with a single monolith with dependency injection, and run all services in the same process.Once the compute and robustness demands mandated we should scale the thing across multiple machines, both horizontally and vertically, I would replace most DI services with proxies that wrapped the original functionality and called out to a remote host.So for this scaled up version, I would only need to change how the DI container got started, which could either be in 'Manager' mode (meaning a high level functionality, with the submodules injected as proxies calling out to services on client machines), 'Worker' mode (meaning it served the proxy requests on said worker machines) or 'Standalone' mode (meaning the DI container actually injected the actual fat versions of the services, that allowed the whole thing to run in a single process, very useful for local testing and debugging).The was only a single executable which could be run in multiple 'modes' selected via a command line switch, which made versioning and deployment trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess it depends on what world you live in. For example, using ASPNET Core, I just drop in this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/ra... and boom I have rate limiting and I do not have to stress about threads or state or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725516</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first job out of college was working at Epic on MyChart. Great people, terrible code.Epic’s main problem is a lack of clear internal code ownership. Everyone owns all the code. This means that even if you clean something up, someone on the other side of the company may come in and mess things up again.This led to really defensive programming where developers would never refactor, they would simply add a new if case for their new functionality somewhere deep in the code, then prop drill the data down. This led to every core function having over a dozen parameters and hundreds of branches. It eventually became impossible to reason about. Cross team calls were just function calls rather than defined apis. This made it fast to develop code initially, but terrible to own long term. This mainly applies to their Mumps code.While I was there I felt like Epic was beyond saving, but with a big push there may be something they can do:1. Enforce some level of code complexity. Best practice is 40 lines per function and no more than 4 parameters per function. Epic probably shouldn’t shoot for that, but a 100 line limit and 6 parameters per function would already be a huge improvement.2. Enforce strong code ownership. Epic has many people who are there for life, let them cook. Epic should segment off code to certain teams so those owners can fix it at their leisure. Cross team api calls should be clear API contracts. It would require some more discussions to get feature requests approved since not everyone can do anything anymore, but the code would gradually improve.Epic is too important to fail. I hope things have started to improve since I left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many tech companies have been consistently crushing it in their fields for nearly 50 years? I didn't appreciate Epic enough while I worked there (left 12 years ago), but I did learn some of their ways:- There were no PMs. No one was chasing vanity metrics. No endless barrage of a/b tests. No growth hacking. Instead, product was built the old-fashioned way - by talking to customers; quite often, customers would reach out to us! "Please build time-saving feature x", "support new medical procedure y", "help us publish more research by analyzing z". The heap of ideas was large, and teams were free to apply their own ranking functions. Some top-down strategic initiatives were threaded through all products. This led to every release being packed with things that customers wanted.- They leveraged their advantages. Plentiful, cheap land → everyone had an office with a door, possibly shared with 1 other person. Productive people flourished. On the flip side, those who were languishing fell faster and deeper into their holes.- They learned to live with their weaknesses. Not everyone wants to live in WI, and many who are willing to try end up looking for warmer pastures in a few years. Epic ended up being an early-career transit hub. Their attrition rates would cripple most tech cos, but they shored themselves through extensive training programs, and by rewarding the anchors that stayed.- They took pride in the product. Every month, the CEO personally presented the latest qualitative assessment of each product (as assessed by an independent third-party). If your product slipped from green to yellow, the pressure would trickle down to you. Also, there were no outbound sales, because having the product speak for itself was the sales strategy.Of course, not everything was rosy, but much has been said here about the shortcomings of Epic, and I wanted to point out what's contributed to the immense stamina that has kept them in the lead for decades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The link is either down or blocked outside of US.For those not from US this has nothing to do with EPIC Games and I assume no part of Unreal is using MUMPS for those who are reading comments before they click on the link.This Epic has something to do with healthcare software. And kind of surprised how many people who used to work there appeared on HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43756309</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a really cool project — love the simplicity and the TUI approach, especially with the timeline histogram and remote-first design. I had similar pain points at my end when dealing with logs across many hosts, which led to building Logdy[1] — a tool with a slightly different philosophy.Logdy is more web-based and focuses on live tailing, structured log search, and quick filtering across multiple sources, also without requiring a centralized server. Not trying to compare directly, but if you're exploring this space, you might find it useful as a complementary approach or for different scenarios. Although we need to work more on adding ability to query multiple hosts.Anyway, kudos on nerdlog—always great to see lean tools in the logging space that don’t require spinning up half a dozen services.[1] https://logdy.dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work!  The TUI looks really sharp and I like the histogram on top.  Going to play with this today.TIL awk patterns can be more than just regexes and can be combined with boolean operators.  I've written a bit of awk and never realized this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;journalctl is mentioned once in the landing page and it seems to imply that journalctl is not supported per se, as logs need to be stored plaintext to legacy syslog (?).I do not want to store plaintext logs and use ancient workarounds like logrotate. journald itself has the built-in ability to receive logs from remote hosts (journald remote &amp; gateway) and search them using --merge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43750765</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Nvidia's transition from a dominant leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market to facing new challenges and dilemmas. It examines the company's journey, highlighting how its innovations and strategies propelled its success in gaming, artificial intelligence, and data centers. However, it also addresses emerging competition, market saturation, and regulatory scrutiny that could impact Nvidia's future growth. The piece reflects on the need for the company to adapt and evolve in an increasingly complex technological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like another article based on the assumption that Nvidia just sits there doing nothing while everyone who has so far proven unable to compete suddenly figures it out and steals their lunch.At some point one of these Nvidia doomers will be right but there is a long line of them who failed miserably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, Marvell is actually down over 50% this year. I just don't understand the bear case at all. I'm a nobody and I'm still willing to buy a $1500 gpu, and that GPU still can't do what the cloud does. The next $1500 gpu probably can't either. It feels like we're over thinking this. The hardware roll-out is all there is imho. Jensen has mentioned he sees Nvidia being a 10 trillion-dollar company, and I'm willing to meet him half-way with my faith here.Edit:- I wonder what's stopping Nvida from releasing an AI phone- A LLM competitor service (Hey, how about you guys make your own chips?)- They are already releasing an AI PC- Their own self driving cars- Their own robotsIf you mess with them, why won't they just compete with you?Just wanted to say one more thing, that Warren Buffet famously said he regretted not investing in both Google and Apple. I think something like this is happening again, especially as there are lulls that the mainstream public perceives, but enthusiasts don't. To maintain the hyperbole, if you are not a full believer as a developer, then you are simply out of your mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author completely underestimates NVIDIA's strategic position. They don't need to win the hardware game forever - they're building the entire AI stack: hardware, networking, software, models, developer tools. Nobody else is doing this comprehensively. While hyperscalers are making custom chips for their own use cases, NVIDIA is building a unified platform that everyone else will use. This isn't about who makes the best GPU, it's about who builds the ecosystem that becomes the industry standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43757017</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the classification of the number 1 in relation to prime numbers, offering insights into mathematical definitions and the implications of including or excluding 1 as a prime number. It explains that traditionally, prime numbers are defined as integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves, which means 1 is not considered prime. The piece further explores the consequences of this definition for number theory and mathematics as a whole, emphasizing that while the exclusion of 1 simplifies certain theories, it also leads to important historical and conceptual discussions about the nature of primes and their role in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43755506"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One reason that 1 is often excluded from the prime numbers is that if it was included, it would complicate the theorems, proofs, and exposition by the endless repetition of "not equal to 1".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some other definition fun: Should we define 0 both positive and negative, or neither positive and negative? Does monotonically increasing mean x&lt;y -&gt; f(y)&lt;f(x) or x≤y -&gt; f(x)≤f(y)? Should we deny the law of excluded middle and use constructive math? Does infinity exist? If infinity exists, is it actual (as an object) or potential (as a function)? Is the axiom of choice true? Or, is the axiom of determinacy true?Should we use a space-time manifold, or separate space and time dimensions? Do future objects exist, and do past objects exist? Do statements about the future have a definite truth value? Does Searle's Chinese Room think? Which Ship of Theseus is the original: the slowly replaced ship, or the ship rebuilt from the original parts?I find that so many philosophy debates actually argue over definitions rather than practical matters, because definitions do matter. Well, add your own fun definition questions!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If 1 is prime, then the fundamental theorem of arithmetic goes from "every positive integer can be written as a product* of primes in one and only one way" to "every positive integer can be written as a product of primes greater than 1 in one and only one way". Doesn't quite have the same ring to it. So just from an aesthetic perspective, no I'd rather 1 isn't a prime number.* empty products being 1 of course&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43755506</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How "trustworthy" is the "dedicated network processing accelerator (NPU) (supports L2/L3 hardware processing, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, 20Gbps switching capacity, full byte wire-speed forwarding)"? Is it fully "hardware", auditable, or does/could it run some blob firmware with unknown/undocumented "features"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, the previous (probably more expensive) Banana Pi BPI-F3 is faster and has more cores.
This one has 4 C908 cores @1.25GHz with VLEN=128 and the BPI-F3 has 8 X60 cores @1.6GHz with VLEN=256.Both are simple in-order cores and they are likely even based on the same predicessor implementation.Edit: Actually, I don't know the VLEN, but previous boards with C908 had 128-bit vectors. The IP is configurable, so it could also have a larger VLEN, or no vector support at all.Edit2: It might be no vector support at all, since the device tree doesn't list support for the "V" extension: https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-RV2-SF21H8898-OPENWRT-BS...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks good on paper, but more importantly if it couldn’t run on mainline Linux kernel I won’t buy it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735734</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unique challenges and experiences of photographing an NBA game, highlighting the fast-paced action and the need for quick reflexes to capture pivotal moments such as slam dunks and referee interactions. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the game, positioning, and equipment, as well as the chaotic environment of the arena filled with fans and media. The author shares personal insights and tips for aspiring sports photographers, aiming toprovide a behind-the-scenes perspective on the art of sports photography in a high-stakes setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43731335"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The big thing missing from the article is the strobes.Flash is how pros get their pictures and there is a network of massive strobes that the photographic pool share. Same is true for most basketball arenas in the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used to know a guy who became a freelance sports photographer focusing on EPL games in Manchester. Paid better than his previous role as a writer for the local paper, but seemed much more challenging on various technical matters - you get all the issues covered in this article, but also you're having to get to an outdoor game, in Manchester, in the middle of January. I'd meet him warming up in a city centre pub after the games, and it would take him hours to thaw out. Although the beer was decent in there, too...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related interesting fact (which I learned the hard way). Indoor volleyball is one of the hardest sports to photograph well. It shares many of the same technical challenges as indoor basketball but a hitter's swing and subsequent ball speed are much faster.As a fairly serious amateur photographer possessing the usual higher-end DSLRs and a backpack full of lenses, when our teen daughter showed interest and aptitude in competitive club volleyball, my wife asked "Hey, with all that gear can you get some dramatic shots of her playing?" "Sure!" I naively responded. I started to realize just how wrong I was  when I tried to shoot the first game and largely failed to get shots that were A) at the right moment, B) not motion blurred, and C) in focus.I was shocked. Only once I'd failed did I bother to look up "Shooting Indoor Volleyball" and discover posts from Olympic-level pro sports photographers commiserating about the unique challenges of indoor V-ball. There are two sets of interrelated problems that compound each other: technical and practical. The main technical problem is that a lot of indoor volleyball courts aren't very well lit. Sure, they seem bright enough to the naked eye but freezing high-speed motion needs a lot of light to enable a fast shutter speed. And you need a long lens (ie a lot of zoom) because you can't be right alongside the court due to line judges needing clear sight lines and the ever-present risk of players chasing an errant ball trampling you. Lenses that do all of that at high-quality and auto-focus quickly are big, heavy and very expensive. If indoor volleyball was outdoors, even on a cloudy day, there would be double the light and this would all be much easier.The second set of problems are practical. There a 12 players on the court, six on a side in two rows of three. As you try to line up shots where the action is likely to happen you quickly discover that this configuration has players constantly moving in front of the shot zone you were aiming for. And this is where auto-focus becomes a real challenge as it will constantly be refocusing on the players moving into your frame in front of or behind the 'shot zone', which is empty because the hitter is winding up and still flying toward the shot zone where the hit will happen. Of course, you can also take the approach of picking a player and having the auto-focus stick to that player, except the whole goal of the ball setter and potential hitters is to hide which player is actually going to hit the ball for as long as possible. Oh, and there's a grid of sharp black lines called "the net" just 20-inches away from your shot zone desperately trying to get your auto-focus to focus on it instead of the ball or hitter (neither of which are there yet).I did ultimately manage to get enough good shots. My wife and daughter were pleased. I only managed to do this by shooting literally thousands of shots and spending hours reviewing shots to find the few keepers. Having a camera capable of shooting over 20 50 megapixel shots a second helps. I spent a fair bit of that time wishing my daughter had taken a liking to softball instead... :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43731335</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for optimizing heap allocations in programming to improve performance and reduce memory usage. It emphasizes the importance of understanding memory management and features techniques such as allocating contiguous memory, using custom allocators, and minimizing fragmentation. The author provides practical examples and insights on implementing these optimizations effectively, ultimately aiming to enhance the efficiency of applications that heavily rely on dynamic memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43731334"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if the reason the escape analysis fails could be that, for small enough types, the concrete value is directly inlined inside the interface value, instead of the latter being "a smart pointer" as the author said. So when the compiler needs to take a reference to the concrete value in `vs.chunkStore`, that ends up as an internal pointer inside the `vs` allocation, requiring it to be on the heap.Either that or the escape analysis just isn't smart enough; taking a pointer to an internal component of an interface value seems like a bit of a stretch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  The notion of stack vs heap allocation isn't something that even exists in the language. Users are expected to not worry about it... until, of course, until you're optimizing performance and you need to worry about it.

This is one of the best and worst aspects with Go. Anyone can write pretty performant code without having to understand the underlying memory model. If you get to the point where you are trying to optimize at this level, the benefits of using a more approachable language start to fall apart and you spend more time chasing implementation details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's possible that this is a compiler bug. It's also possible that there's some fringe case where the reference actually can escape via that method call, and the compiler doesn't have enough context to rule it out.Here's an example, I think: suppose the method spawns a new goroutine that contains a reference to `chunkStore`. This goroutine can outlive the `ReadBytes` function call, and thus Go has to heap allocate the thing being referenced.In general, this kind of example makes me suspect that Go's escape analysis algorithm treats any method call as a black box and heap allocates anything being passed to it by reference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43731334</guid></item><item><title>48.

You might not care or notice at a glance, but the text does feel unmistakably translated. That is a constant reminder of that fact that translation is a job that takes real skill, not just knowledge of both language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My layman take on this is I don’t really want to read a book where “There isn't a paragraph or turn of phrase which feels like it didn't originate in English”.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Demystifying Python Decorators" provides a comprehensive overview of decorators in Python, explaining what they are, how they work, and their practical applications. It breaks down the syntax and functionality of decorators, demonstrating their use through clear examples. The article also discusses various types of decorators, including function decorators, class decorators, and built-in decorators, while addressing common misconceptions. By the end, readers gain a clearer understanding of how to implement decorators effectively in their code to enhance functionality and maintain cleaner code structures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;outside of __init__, I thought it wasn't the pythonic way to directly invoke double underscore functions like closure? I recall reading that you should implement a class that overrides/implements such functions instead? I get why the author might be doing it this way to describe the topic of the post, but would calling __closure__() be acceptable in production code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's absolutely baffling that an article called demystifying decorators does not actually describe decorators at all, preferring to keep them a mystery. Decorators are nothing more than a special syntax for calling a function, the meat of which can easily be explained in a single paragraph including a supporting example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jdjfm df&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746532</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Knuth used to go to a secretary school to learn touch typing, and IIRC he could easily type more than 120 WPM. Yet he decided to write his books and papers first with pencil and a piece of paper, and then type them out. The reason is that he found that he typed faster than he could think, which in turn interfered with his thinking process, while writing on paper matches his speed of thinking.I also find taking notes on paper helps me focus more than typing, but it could be just that writing slows me down so I have more time to unconsciously reflect more. I also find writing math on paper is way more effective than using a computer, but that's most likely because I'm not that familiar with LaTex, so typing out equations interrupts my thought process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think I care about what brain activation happens while I'm writing per se -- though I may care about behavioral/performance differences. Do you think more deeply or remember better when taking notes by hand? Are you more likely to catch errors?Here's one study that looked at unrelated word recall tasks, and didn't see convincing evidence of a difference between handwriting and typing. However, they leave open whether there are differences that arise in more complex learning environments.
https://www.jowr.org/jowr/article/view/963/930I think the higher-level, more realistic experiment I'd like to see someone do is: for a single college-level psychology class, split students into handwriting vs typing groups, and assure them that they'll all be graded on a curve within their assigned group, and see if top-level performance between the two groups differs over a term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lol!&gt; suggests handwriting may be irreplaceable when it comes to learning.&gt; For the typing condition, participants typed the same words on a keyboard using only their right index finger.So they tested exactly nothing useful.Give it up Mrs. Smith, the keyboard won.In seriousness, I would always expect pressing a single button to require less brain power than drawing a complex line, even more so if the subjects have been in the digital world for the last 10 years.Just from a pure mechanical motion finger movement of a single key being pressed at a time is far less than most of the full hand engagement wiring requires.The study might have been better if the types used a full keyboard with both hands, but I suspect they always know the results would not be worthy to write home about.But even they were. The task of transcribing is not all that engaging. Maybe I would have reserve brain power to do the task.You will also have to convince me that what is measured, brain connectivity, is a metric we care about and has any real impact beyond being a fun trick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43752433</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a tenant's experience with their landlord's poorly functioning boiler, which led to various personal frustrations and challenges in getting repairs completed. It highlights the issues faced by tenants when dealing with maintenance problems, including the lack of urgency from landlords, the impact of such issues on living conditions, and the tenant's attempts to advocate for better service. The piece combines humor with a critique of the landlord-tenant dynamic, revealing the struggles many face in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I also have it so the heating turns off when I go into town and turns back on when I'm just a few train stops away so my place is nice and toasty for me getting home!If your goal is saving energy/money, you don’t want a system capable of going from cool to toasty in 20 minutes.Instead, you want a system that runs (much) lower water circulation temperatures (giving lower losses in the unconditioned spaces and more even room heating). That can be done to any condensing boiler by just turning down the flow target temperature.A second layer of optimization on top of this is the addition of outdoor reset/weather compensation which will adjust that flow temperature based on the outside temperature, giving a flow temperature than can just barely restore the building to the desired setpoint temp.With mine properly tuned, I was targeting having the thermostat act more like a high-limit and for it to call for heat between 22 and 24 hours per day while not overheating the house. That often meant flow temps in the 110°F (warm day) to 135°F (below freezing day) range. Compared to the prior winter (at a constant 160°F flow), the house used 8-15% less gas and was wildly more comfortable. (This setup does preclude using deep setback settings, which also can save money, because recovery times are necessarily long in such a scheme, unless you have an even smarter control system that can run perfectly tuned water most times but hotter water during recovery from setbacks.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an awesome hack!It seems like the easier hack would be to put a peltier heater/cooler under the thermostat then control that remotely to assume control over what temperature the thermostat sees.The link to the exact model of thermostat isn't working, so I don't know how amenable its design is to this approach, but the thermostats I've used are generally wall-mounted and putting a heat/cool source under them wouldn't be too hard. You'd need to make sure that you didn't send both the heat and cool into the thermostat, but that's a simple positioning problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would probably just go about this by heating/cooling the thermostat itself rather than messing around with radio signals. Put a little box around it and something that could control the temp in the box, like a little peltier element. When you want the heat to run, cool the inside of the box. When you want it to stop, warm it up. Etc.But then I build thermal control devices for fun so maybe it just seems like a much easier method to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43759073</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article criticizes Synology for their recent decision to implement hard drive locking on their NAS devices, which restricts users from using third-party or non-Synology hard drives. The author argues that this move undermines consumer choice and flexibility, likening it to anti-competitive practices that prioritize corporate profit over user rights. The article highlights the potential negative impact on customers, emphasizing the importance of open standards in storage solutions and calling for Synology to reconsider this policy to maintain user trust and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synology isn't about the NAS hardware and OS. Once setup, it doesn't really matter as long as your config is reliable and fast, so there are many competitive options to move to.The killer feature for me is the app ecosystem. I have a very old 8-bay Synology NAS and have it setup in just a few clicks to backup my dropbox, my MS365 accounts, my Google business accounts, do redundant backup to external drive, backup important folders to cloud, and it was also doing automated torrent downloads of TV series.These apps, and more (like family photos, video server, etc), make the NAS a true hub for everything data-related, not just for storing local files.I can understand Synology going this way, it puts more money in their pocket, and as a customer in professional environment, I'm ok to pay a premium for their approved drives if it gives me an additional level of warranty and (perceived) safety.But enforcing this accross models used by home or soho users is dumb and will affect the good will of so many like me, who both used to buy Synology for home and were also recommending/purchasing the brand at work.This is a tech product, don't destroy your tech fanbase.I would rather Synology kept a list of drives to avoid based on user experience, and offer their Synology-specific drives with a generous warranty for pro environments. Hel, I would be ok with sharing stats about drive performance so they could build a useful database for all.They way they reduce the performance of their system to penalise non-synology rebranded drives is bascially a slap in the face of their customers. Make it a setting and let the user choose to use the NAS their bought to its full capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synology became so bad, they measure disk space in percent, and thresholds cannot be configured to lower than 5%. This may have been okay when volume sizes were in gigabytes, but now with multi-TB drives, 5% is a lot of space. 
The result of that is NAS in permanent alarm state because less than 5% space is free. And this makes it less likely for the user to notice when an actual alarm happens because they are desensitised to warnings.
I submitted this to them at least four times, and they reply that this is fine, it’s already decided to be like that, so we will not change it.
Another stupid thing is that notifications about low disk space are sent to you via email and push until it’s about 30 GB free. Then free space goes below 30 GB and reaches zero, yet notifications are not sent anymore. 
My multiple reports about this issue always responded along the lines of “it’s already done like that, so we will not change it”.Most modern, especially software companies, choose not to fix relatively small but critical problems, yet they actively employ sometimes hundreds of customer support yes-people whose job seems to be defusing customer complaints. Nothing is ever fixed anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is one argument for Synology doing this: There have been cases where hard drive companies mislead their customers. I personally fell victim to this when Western Digital started selling SMR drives as WD Red, without labelling them as SMR drives.So lots of customers thought they were buying a drive that's perfect for NAS, only to discover that the drives were completely unsuitable and took days to restore, or failed alltogether. Synology had to release updates to their software to deal with the fake NAS drives, and their support was probably not happy to deal with all the angry customers who thought the problem was with Synology, and not Western Digital for selling fake NAS drives.If you buy a drive from Synology, you know it will work, and won't secretly be a cheaper drive that's sold as NAS compatible even though it is absolutely unsuitable for NAS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734706</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of lazy materialization in ClickHouse, a high-performance analytical database. This feature allows for more efficient query execution by delaying the computation of certain data until it's actually needed, reducing unnecessary processing and memory usage. The blog highlights the benefits of this approach, including improved performance and faster query times, especially in complex query scenarios. It also outlines how lazy materialization enhances the overall user experience by optimizing resource management, ultimately leading to quicker data insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763688"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;God clickhouse is such great software, if it only it was as ergonomic as duckdb, and management wasn't doing some questionable things (deleting references to competitors in GH issues, weird legal letters, etc.)The CH contributors are really stellar, from multiple companies (Altinity, Tinybird, Cloudflare, ClickHouse)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Late Materialization, 19 years later.https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/34929/MIT-CSA...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This optimization should provide dramatic speed-ups when taking random samples from massive data sets, especially when the wanted columns can contain large values. That's because the basic SQL recipe relies on a LIMIT clause to determine which rows are in the sample (see query below), and this new optimization promises to defer reading the big columns until the LIMIT clause has filtered the data set down to a tiny number of lucky rows.    SELECT *
    FROM Population
    WHERE weight &gt; 0
    ORDER BY -LN(1.0 - RANDOM()) / weight
    LIMIT 100  -- Sample size.

Can anyone from ClickHouse verify that the lazy-materialization optimization speeds up queries like this one? (I want to make sure the randomization in the ORDER BY clause doesn't prevent the optimization.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763688</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of computational knitting, I recently learned about "solid knitting" [1] which is awesome.https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2024/solid-knitting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Braid groups are really interesting, and they also come up in fluid mixing: https://people.math.wisc.edu/~thiffeault/talks/gordon2022.pd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the 1980s I was taking a foundational computer science course in which we derived Goedel's result using Cantor diagonalization. Excellent course. We were watching the TV version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at the time, too. One day I had the realization that since any recursively enumerable function could be interpreted as a computer program (given the right interpreter), that the sweater I was wearing was in fact possibly a computer program, and that all knitting (and some crocheting) was in fact just a manifestation of code in another language.I then went on to realize any enumerable set could be similarly interpreted, including the entire countable population of Earth. And we already had the answer (42), but what was the question?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763614</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago, I taught CS for a year in a local high school. I can very much relate to the notion of "astonishing facts were presented without astonishment": as a teacher, you don't have the freedom to teach whatever you want (of course), but you're very tightly bound to a curriculum that's developed by the state government. And for CS, this curriculum was so uninteresting and uninspiring (what a surprise: 13 year old kids don't care about the history of computers), that I couldn't blame any of my students not to show much interest in my classes.As a matter of fact, I gave up after just one year. It wasn't any fun for anyone, not for the students, not for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My fork in the road with hard tech hard science versus biology was in high school. It seemed that students that wanted to become doctors took AP biology and students that wanted to be engineers took physics and chemistry. I had wanted to be an engineer since I was 12 years old so I felt the decision was already made. But all studying neural networks in college in the 80s I realized that there was this tremendously rich domain of real neurons which I knew nothing about. I worked as a software engineer for a couple years after graduating but then went back to school to study Neurophysiology. I did not pursue it as my area of work or research, but I am grateful for having had the opportunity to look at the world from the perspective of a biologist.If you're an engineer and early in your career and feel there's something missing from your intellectual space, I encourage you to go back and get a graduate degree in something totally different. Humans live a very long time so don't feel like you're wasting time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I invested a great deal of effort over 30+ years to learn biology, which I started to love in high school when a teacher introduced us to molecular biology.    Over time I've come to appreciate that biology is a huge field and people who master one area often know little to nothing about many others.To be proficient in biology you need to have "Extra" skills: extra ability to work with ambiguity,ability to memorize enormous amounts of descriptive information, and highly abstract representations.  Digital biology often loses many aspects of biological reality, and then fails to make useful predictions.Over the years, I've come to realize I know less and less about biology- that I greatly underestimated the complexity and subtlety of biological processes, and have come to admit that my own intelligence is too limited to work on some problems that I originally thought would be "easy engineering problems".A great example of the rabbit hole that is modern biology is summed up here: what is the nature of junk DNA?  To what extents are digital readouts like ENCODE representative of true biology, rather than just measuring noise?  What is the nature of gene and protein evolution?https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(12)...
(note that while I disagree strongly with Eddy in many ways, I've come to recognize that I simply don't understand the modern view of evolution outside the perspective of molecular biology (IE, what geneticists like Eddy think).Also, recently, Demis Hassabis postulated that if he is successful, we will come up with silver bullet cures in 10 years time simply using machine learning.  It's amazing how many computer scientists (I call him that rather than a biologist, although he has worked into neuro) make this conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43764076</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository showcases a Prolog-based adventure game created by the author, Stefan Rodrigues. The game allows players to explore a textual environment where they can make decisions and interact with various elements in the game world. The repository includes all the necessary files for running the game, along with instructions for setup and gameplay. Additionally, it serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of Prolog for creating interactive narratives and game logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project "101 BASIC Computer Games" on GitHub is a collection of classic computer games implemented in the BASIC programming language. It serves as a resource for learning and experimenting with BASIC coding through a variety of classic game scripts, including popular games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Pong, and Hangman. The repository not only provides the source code for these games but also encourages users to contribute by improving the code or adding new games, making it a valuable tool for both beginners and seasoned programmers interested in retro gaming and programming techniques in BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh my, this is so amazing. I can't wipe the grin off my face. I never thought I was would see Hammurabi (https://github.com/maurymarkowitz/101-BASIC-Computer-Games/b...) again!With this I can pinpoint the exact first bug I created, and debugged. The year was 1991 +/- 1, the place was Canberra Australia. For unknown reasons that changed my life forever, my Dad got on board with this "computer" thing and bought an "Osborne" 486 PC. That year I went to the school fete and, for AUD 0.20, picked up a used copy of this book, leafed through the pages, settled on Hammurabi, and after some struggle and discussions with friends, managed to run Q-Basic and typed this program into it. And it sort of worked, but something was wrong, and after much experimentation I found that on line 11 (only today, with this post can, I finally state the true line number) I had written "LET P=P+1" instead of the correct "LET P=P+I". After a fair bit (days) of trial and error and 10-year-old reasoning, I figured that out, and so it began.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are craving a BASIC fix, I highly recommend getting a DOS emulator like DosBos-X and just installing a copy of Quickbasic 4.5 (which has a compiler among other niceties over the original Microsoft QBASIC). You can easily find it on the Internet Archive.There are modern variants like QB64, but personally I find that BASIC really loses a lot of its appeal/flavor when you move from an interpretative language to a compiled one.https://dosbox-x.comI made this a while ago and it ran beautifully in DosBox on my Mac:https://specularrealms.com/q-basic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's so entertaining to just pour through the source for each game and read the language used at the time, like in the game instructions or result responses.There's something refreshing about seeing things described in different ways than they are now. I always wonder if some long forgotten words of phrasings will make their way back into public consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43757341</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, so I built this thing, most of it at so far at least. And yeah, right now it isn't doing many things better than Homebrew.Setting of relative paths for bottle installs is still not perfect, well it works for every bottle I have tested except rust. Getting bottles working 100% is very doable though imo.Build from source formulae is still pretty f*ed + I do not know if it is really feasible given that the json API lacks information there and a full on Ruby -&gt; Rust transpiler is way out of scope. Will probably settle for automatic build system detection based on archive structure there. + Maybe do my own version of the .rb scripts but in a more general machine readable format, not .rs lolCasks seem to work but I have only tested some .dmg -&gt; .app ones and .pkg installers so far though. As with bottles 100% doable.Given that almost all formulae are available as bottles for modern ARM mac this could become a fully featured package manager. Actually didn't think so many people would look at it, started building it for myself because Homebrew just isn't cutting it for what I want.Started working on a declarative package + system manager for mac because I feel ansible is overkill for one machine and not really made for that and nix-darwin worms itself into the system so deep. Wrapping Brew commands was abysmally slow though so I started working on this and by now I am deep enough in I won't stop xDAnyway I am grateful for every bug report, Issue and well meaning pull request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With my Homebrew hat on, but not speaking for others: I think this is pretty cool, and demonstrates something that we've discussed indirectly for years.At its core, there are really two parts to Homebrew:1. There's the client side, i.e. `brew`, which 99.9% of users stick to happy paths (bottle installs, supported platforms) within. These users could be supported with relative ease by a small native-code installer, since the majority of the work done by the installer in the happy path is fetching bottles, exploding them, and doing a bit of relocation.2. There's literally everything else, i.e. all of the developer, repository, and CI/CD machinery that keeps homebrew-core humming. This is the largely invisible infrastructure that makes `brew install` work smoothly, and it's very hard to RIIR (in a large part because it's tied heavily to the formula DSL, which is arbitrary Ruby).(1) is a nice experimental space, because Homebrew does (IMO) a decent job of isolating the client-facing side from the complexity of (2). However, (2) is where the meat-and-potatoes of packaging happens, and where Homebrew's differentiators really lie (specifically, in how easy it is to contribute new packages and bump existing ones).Edit: Another noteworthy aspect here around performance: I mentioned this in another comment[1], but parallel downloads of things like bottles and DMGs is not an architectural limitation of Homebrew itself, but instead a conscious decision to trade some install speed for courtesy towards the services we fetch from (including GitHub itself). Smaller projects can sidestep this because they're not directing nearly the same degree of volume; I think this project will discover if/when its volumes grow that it will need to serialize downloads to avoid being throttled or outright limited.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43765605&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like a fun little project, nice work!I'm not a big fan of keeping the Homebrew terminology though. I never know what a formula, keg, cask, cellar, tap or bottle is. Why not keep to the standard terms of package and repository etc? I don't know beer brewing terminology or how beer brewing is analogous to package management, and I honestly wish that it wasn't something which my tools expect me to learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43765011</guid></item><item><title>10.

Any feature outside that is open source under the MIT expat license."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to have something like this but calling a cloud is a no-go for me. I have a half baked tool that a friend of mine and I applied to the Mozilla Builders Grant with (didn't get in), it's janky and I don't have time to work on it right now but it does the thing. I also find myself using OpenWebUI's context RAG stuff sometimes but I'd really like to have a way to dump all of my private documents into a DB and have search/RAG work against them locally, preferably in a way that's agnostic of the LLM backend.Does such a project exist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couldn't upload files, all had error 'failed to fetch'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763814</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In another post (https://alexshtf.github.io/2025/03/27/Free-Poly.html) the author fits a degree-10000 (ten thousand!) polynomial using the Legendre basis. The polynomial _doesn't overfit_, demonstrating double descent. "What happened to our overfitting from ML 101 textbooks? There is no regularization. No control of the degree. But “magically” our high degree polynomial is not that bad!"So... are _all_ introductions to machine learning just extremely wrong here? I feel like I've seen tens of reputable books and courses that introduce overfitting and generalization using severe overfitting and terrible generalization of high-degree polynomials in the usual basis (1,x,x^2,...). Seemingly everyone warns of the dangers of high-degree polynomials, yet here the author just says "use another basis" and proves everyone wrong? Mind blown, or is there a catch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A well-known related paper that I didn't see mentioned in the article (although Trefethen was mentioned) is "Six Myths of Polynomial Interpolation and Quadrature".https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/mythspaper.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's something I'm fundamentally missing here--if the standard basis and the Berenstain basis describe exactly the same set of polynomials of degree n, then surely the polynomial of degree n that minimizes the mean square error is singular (and independent of the basis--the error is the samples vs the approximation, the coefficients/basis are not involved) so both the standard basis and Berenstain basis solution are the same (pathological, overfitted, oscillating) curve?Like I understand how the standard basis is pathological because the higher degree powers diverge like mad so given "reasonable" components the Berenstain basis is more likely to give "reasonable" curves but if you're already maximizing I don't understand how you arrive at a different curve.What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43764101</guid></item><item><title>13.

It's clearly a popular idea and I see a lot of excitement about it (see Google's A2A thing) but it feels to me like a pattern that, in many cases, will make LLM code even harder to get reliable results from.I worry it's the AI-equivalent of microservices: useful in a small set of hyper complex systems, the vast majority of applications that adopt it would have been better off without.If there are strong arguments counter to what I've said here I'd love to hear them!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It’s becoming clear that real-world agentic systems work best when multiple agents collaborate, rather than having one agent attempt to do everything."In a recent episode of Practical AI with the people behind All Hands:"...when the Open Hands project started out, we were kind of on this bandwagon of trying to create a big agentic framework that you could use with and define lots of different agents. You could have your debugging agent, you could have your software architect agent, you could have your browsing agent and all of these things like this. And we actually implemented a framework where you could have one agent delegate to another agent and then that agent would go off and do this task and things like this.One somewhat surprising thing is how ineffective this paradigm ended up being from two perspectives. So the first perspective is it didn't really and this is specifically for the case of software engineering. There might be other cases where this would be useful. But the first is in terms of effectiveness, we found that having a single agent that just has all of the necessary context, it has the ability to write code, use a web browser to gather information and execute code. Ends up being able to do a pretty large swath of tasks without a lot of specific tooling and structuring around the problems."https://practicalai.fm/310Not saying it is wrong. But I don't think it is something that is "clear" and we can take for granted so some benchmarks/reasoning why would have been great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool! Seems like this is what AutoGen Studio wanted to be. And what a lot of "agentic" libs fell short of - a way to chain together stuff by using natural language.Quick questions (I only looked at the demo video and briefly skimmed the docs, sorry if the qs are explained somewhere):- it looks to me that a lot of the heavy weight "logic" is handled via prompts (when a new agent is created your copilot edits the "prompts"). Have you tested this w/ various models (and especially any open weights ones) to make sure the flows still work? This reminds me of the very early agent libraries that worked w/ oAI GPTs but not much else.- if the above assumption is correct, are there plans of using newer libs where a lot of the logic / lifting is done by code instead of simply chaining prompts and hope the model can handle it? (A2A, pydantic, griptape, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763967</guid></item><item><title>14. π0.5: A VLA with open-world generalization</title><link>https://pi.website/blog/pi05</link><description>

You can download and play around or fine tune their Pi0 VLAs from their servers directly (JAX format) or from Huggingface LeRobot safetensors port. They also have notebooks and code in their repo to get started with fine-tuning. Inference runs in a single 4090 RTX streamed over WiFi to the robot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing! As someone working with industrial robots, normally under strict environmental constraints and control, witnessing such real-world robotics progress truly excites me about the future!By the way, they’ve open-sourced their π0 model (code and model weights). 
More information can be found here: https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm genuinely asking (not trying to be snarky)...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short summary is that this isn't going to work.
I was involved with a company doing some development on whale detection AI. The vast majority of the time you just don't see enough of the animal to make reliable detections. And that is in a best case scenario, add in movement of the boat/camera, waves, sunlight reflections, and having to ignore a vast majority of potential things on/in the water that can look kind of like whales, but are not whales. Dolphins in particular.This isn't a problem for AI/machine vision, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:NOAA: Track Whale Detections With This Interactive Map - https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/track-whale-det...NOAA: Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map - https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/WhaleMap - https://whalemap.org/WhaleMap/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ships are pretty noisy and whales are pretty smart, so the obvious question is why don't they figure out that it is bad to get hit by a ship, that the ships don't see the whales and so aren't able to avoid them, and so move out of the way when a ship is approaching?Is it that the noise from the ships is too low in frequency for the whale to be able to tell what direction it is from? If that is the case could the ships add a higher frequency emitter that the whales could localize, emitting some standardized pattern of pings that the whales could learn means ship?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43764915</guid></item><item><title>18.

It's my favorite new product that I've started using in the last year. I hope they build out an enormous TAM of people who don't want to live inside a terminal and make a ton of money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s a lot of money.What’s Supabase’s exit strategy? Are they sustainable long term as a standalone business?You can also see how money is starting to chase “vibe coding” — as long as you say the magic words, even if your product is only tangentially related to it, you can get funding!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Supabase is currently used by two million developers who manage more than 3.5 million databases. The startup supports Postgres, the most popular developer database system that’s an alternative to Google’s Firebase. Supabase’s goal: To be a one-stop backend for developers and "vibe coders."How many of those users are paid. You can sign up for free without a credit card.It's cool, for certain use cases. I ended up trying it for a few months before switching to Django.If you ONLY need to store data behind some authentication, and handle everything else on the frontend, it's great. Once you need to try some serverside logic it gets weird. I'm open to being wrong, but I found firebase phenomenally more polished and easier to work with particularly when you get to firebase functions compared to edge functions.Self hosting requires magical tricks, it's clearly not a focus for them right now.I hope they keep the free tier intact.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common belief that it takes 21 days to form a new habit, arguing that this idea is a myth and oversimplifies the process of habit formation. It explains that developing a new habit is more complex and can vary greatly among individuals based on numerous factors. The author emphasizes the importance of consistency, motivation, and gradual change over a defined time span, proposing that creating lasting habits often requires ongoing commitment rather than a fixed timeline. Ultimately, the piece encourages readers to focus on their own experiences and adapt their approaches to habit formation rather than relying on arbitrary timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took me a few days to become a smoker, and a few weeks to get to the point of not wanting to smoke again (some decades later).It took me a week or so to start having a healthier breakfast and it become part of my routine, and I've been trying to have healthier lunches for years now (and still regularly fail, normally because at lunchtimes I'm tired, stressed and yearning for comfort foods like sandwiches and snack bars).I think anyone who believed exactly 21 days was the magic number for all habits, for all people, was grossly naive.But what I do find is that after 21 days it's no longer novel, it's just what you do, if somebody asks you what you do about X, you no longer say "I'm trying this new thing around X, and...", you tell them your new habit. Identifying that habit as part of who you are is key to it being sticky. For some people, and for some habits, that might be true after a week, or it might take a year, but it's an important step, and if you want that habit to stick you should get to it as fast as you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I happen to be taking a Team Lead course, and forming habits came up yesterday. 21 days weren't mentioned explicitly, the time frame was "a few weeks". We were given 6 criteria when forming a habit:1. Tangible - you need to pick a tangible action that is observable. If you're trying to fix a part of your behavior you can't pick "I'll pay more attention" as a habit to correct yourself, instead you should write a note or say some phrase.2. Up to me - don't form a habit that requires outside factors. If you want to start jogging, don't ask your neighbor to jog with you. Each time he's not available, you'll have an excuse not to jog.3. Swallow the frog - don't push it off. This isn't a well defined criteria, the idea is to minimize excuses (like #2).4. Daily - a habit needs to be formed by taking action every day.5. Trigger - your action needs a trigger. This can be an internal (feeling hungry), external (a timer on your phone), or contextual (every morning, every time you walk into a conference room).6. New - it's very hard to form a habit if you've already tried and failed. Pick an action that you haven't already tried.There was also an important note that changing behavior often requires multiple steps. The instructor gave the example of using dental floss. It's hard to go from nothing to flossing every day, so break it into:1. Every time you go into the bath room in the evening, pick up the dental floss, and put it down.2. After picking up the floss becomes a habit, cut a piece of floss, and throw it out.3. After cutting the floss becomes a habit, floss a few teeth.And so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It only takes a couple of days for a habit to stop, too. It's real easy to go from "I am a person who does this thing every day" to "I last did it half a week ago and I dunno".(Addictions are a different story of course.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43765084</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does it differ from Prusti and Creusot?I feel, with more and more tools crowding that space, a common specification language would make sense. Sure, every tool has its own  unique selling points but there is considerable overlap. For example, if all I want is to express that I expect a function not to panic, there should be one syntax that works with all tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be better to build dependent types into the language itself so that we can guarantee any spec we want? Or do these tools have some advantage over dependent typing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many of these are there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745987</guid></item><item><title>21.

In audio electronics, there is a very expensive market nowadays for vintage hardware, like audio preamps, compressors and such. Due to their imperfection the sound is often considered as more natural. Combined with perfect high-end digital equipment this indeed can lead to great technical productions. I wonder, if there will be the same for video in the future?
I really appreciate the engineers marvel of those dedicated circuits. On the other hand the modern integrated circuits are a marvel in it's own field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43758999</guid></item><item><title>24.

Moreover, black holes, spherically symmetric objects with horizons, display near maximal rotation as presented by Daly (2019). The idea that everything revolves [...] naturally extends to the whole universe, as hinted by recent claims of anisotropic Hubble expansion in X-ray observations by Migkas et al. (2021). Furthermore, a plausible syllogism is that the universe has near-maximal rotation, motivated by cosmologies where the universe is the interior of a black hole (Pathria 1972).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand what I skimmed, the idea is that space-time itself rotates, not all the collective matter in it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I seem to recall there was an article posted here recently which noted that galaxies have a preferred direction of rotation. Seems like the universe itself rotating could be a reason why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733495</guid></item><item><title>25.

Still I can't stop thinking that I wouldn't sleep before I wrote an assembler and a disassembler. Judging by the presentation they had no assembler and disassembler for several months and just lived with that.asm/disasm can help to find typos in listings, they can help to find xrefs or even to do some static analysis to check for mistake classes they knew they could make. It wouldn't replace any of the manual work they've done, but still it can add some confidence on top of it. Maybe they wouldn't end with priors 50/50 for the success, but with something like 90/10.Strange. Do I underestimate the complexity of writing an asm and disasm pair?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think what fascinates me the most about all of this is how there are wide gaps in how much design and engineering documentation from that time period has survived to present day. For a long time, I just assumed that NASA owned and archived every design spec, revision, research paper, memo and napkin doodle related to their public-facing missions. I learned recently that even a lot of the original Gemini and Apollo program code (let alone source code) and docs are apparently gone forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Hello world” takes on new dimensions in this context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43732632</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a recruiting attempt by Los Alamos? AI/ML for science as this broad field used to be known is interesting. Some five years ago there as a real craze where every STEM lab at my university was doing some form of ML project. I think by now people have learned what works and what doesn't. Climate models for example have been quite successful. Possibly the reason is that they learn directly from collected data, rather than trying to emulate the output of simulations. Attempts to build similiar models for fluid dynamics have been rather dismal. In general, big models and big data result in useful models, even if only because these models seem to be somehow interpolating based on similiar training data points. Trying to replace classical physics based models with ML models trained on simulation data does not seem to work. The model is only ever capable of emulating a physically plausible output when the input is close enough to the training data, and that too, only when the system isn't chaotic. For applications where you are generating a sample to be used in a downstream task, ML models trained on lots of data can be very useful. You only need a few lucky guesses, that you can verify downstream, to end up with some useful result. 
In short, there is no magic to it. It's a useful tool that can be regarded as both a search algorithm and an optimization algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes. ML has advanced many fields related to modelling - meteorology, climate, molecular. Classification models have done much for genomics, particle physics, and other fields where experiments produce inhumane amounts of data.DeepVariant, Enformer, ParticleNet, DeepTau, etc. are some well-known individual models that are advanced branches of science. And there are the very famous ones, like AlphaFold (Nobel in Chemistry 2024).We need to think of AI not as a product (chats, agents, etc.), but as neural nets (AlexNet). Unfortunately, large companies are "chat-washing" these tremendously useful technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bit short on details other than "Let's see what LLMs can predict when we train them on various scientific data sets."Certainly a good thing to try, but the article feels like a PR piece more than anything else, as it's not answering anything, just giving a short overview of a few things they're trying with no data on those things whatsoever.It does fit in with the "Throw LLM spaghetti at a wall and see what sticks" trend these days though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43765207</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have quite a few very fond memories of Toys R Us.My Aunt and Uncle would come visit us and part of the ritual was to take my sister and me there and we got one toy each, under a certain budget. I typically got Muscle Men or GI Joe.I can still smell that store in my mind...38 years later. And I can still visualize the GI Joe Aircraft Carrier that was holy unobtainium for me and my families budget.All of this to say...I am thankful I never witnessed the fall. I hit an age where we stopped going and I just never went back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: The Asian arm of Toys 'R' Us never shut down, and while it's far from the most popular retailer (and, IMHO, broadly overpriced), it's maintained a retail presence in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and more.There's an interesting tradition of dead American brands getting a second life in Asia. Swenson's, Sizzler, Dean &amp; Deluca, and Mr. Donut in Southeast Asia, Tower Records and Kinko's in Japan, even 7-11's outsized popularity in Asia versus its more moderate presence in the States. Yahoo! Japan almost counts as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fall isn't covered in very much detail.I think it might be exemplified by a personal example.  I went to one near the end to buy a standard, wooden block, JENGA toy for relatives.  They didn't have any in stock other than some crummy cardboard sticks version (absolutely unable to stand up to the abuse a child under 12 will dish out).  I think I ended up ordering one from Amazon with Prime or hitting up a Target or something...As for the 'category killer' thing, that's probably an example of Market Failure (regulation failure).  For a fungible commodity product, there probably should be a requirement to provide access to the same price to all players in the market.  That might mean that the price at a generic warehouse in one of the major shipping ports is that price.  Stores / groups of stores would still need to leverage shipping and distribution networks, but it'd at least give places a _chance_ to compete.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746202</guid></item><item><title>31.

His quantum field their lectures are especially popular https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qftvids.html.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool. His lecture notes are worth checking out when studying any physics topic imo. I've seen his QFT notes especially recommended in many places, though I haven't yet got that far personally...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great lecturer - when I took Part III he stepped in for a few sessions when the regular lecturer for QFT broke her arm.His notes are always pretty clearly explained. Equally importantly, I've found he's always really responsive if you think you've found an error. (And very patient if the original is correct, and your "correction" is a mistake!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763223</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning" provides an extensive review of various image data augmentation techniques used to enhance the performance of deep learning models in computer vision tasks. It discusses the significance of data augmentation in improving model robustness, addresses common methods such as geometric transformations and color adjustments, and explores novel augmentation strategies, including generative models. The survey also highlights the challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the importance of effective augmentation in training deep neural networks with limited labeled data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This works by locking down the edges of the system (e.g. tools) not to do stupid things, and maintaining provenance information end to end to inform that. That’s great if the attack is “send this sensitive document to baddie@evil.com” but it offers nothing when workflows devolve into pure text, where the attack could be to misinform or actively social engineer. I suppose you’d class this as necessary but not sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been tracking prompt injection for 2.5 years now and this is the first proposed mitigation for it that feels genuinely credible to me. Unlike most of the others it doesn't rely on using other AI models to try and spot injection attacks, which is a flawed approach because if you only catch 99% of attacks your system will be broken by motivated adversarial attackers.(Imagine if we protected against SQL injection or XSS using statistical methods that only caught 99% of attacks!)I wrote up my own extensive thoughts on this paper last week: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/11/camel/Admittedly I have a bias towards it because it builds on a proposal I made a couple of years using dual quarantined and privileged LLMs: https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/25/dual-llm-pattern/I'm particularly tickled that a DeepMind academic paper now exists with a section titled "Is Dual LLM of Willison enough?" (Spoiler: it is not.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say I’m a bit skeptical.The problem with a sandbox that executes arbitrary code (which is what this is; convert a request into code and execute it in a restricted runtime), is that if you expose APIs in that sandbox that can “do things”, then you have to be extraordinarily careful with your security policies to allow “good actions” and deny “bad actions”.The side channel attacks are a good example; what if fetching an external url is the task you want an agent to perform?How do “know” in your security policy what a good url is and what a bad one is?What if the action is to apply a change to a database element? How does your security policy know how to only allow “good” updates?Certainly you can hand craft guard rails (security policies), but at the end of the day you’re no closer or further than any other environment where you’re executing arbitrary code; it just takes different efforts to find the holes in those security policies and apis.Ie. it’s easy to say “if you write a good sandbox and covert your LLM request into code and run it in the sandbox you’re fine”.…but you’re as fine as your sandbox is; if your goal is a sandbox with holes in it for privileged actions; guess what, the arbitrary code you run in it can call those privileged actions.Certainly the data provenance is a cool idea, but I foresee see a lot of “but but but…” when people try to enforce the boundaries in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733683</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another weird one related to Gödel’s theorems is Löb’s theorem: given a sound formal system F and a sentence s, if F proves that “if s is provable in F, then s,” then F also proves s. That is:F ⊢ (Prov_F(“s”) → s) → sWhich is strange because you might think that proving “if s is provable, then s” would be possible regardless of whether s is actually provable. But Löb’s theorem shows that such self-referential statements can only be proven when s itself is already provable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final bit of Baez's article has an interesting bit here:&gt; So, conceivably, the concept of 'standard' natural number, and the concept of 'standard' model of Peano arithmetic, are more subjective than most mathematicians think. Perhaps some of my 'standard' natural numbers are nonstandard for you! I think most mathematicians would reject this possibility... but not all.It's probably worth elaborating why the majority of logicians (and likely most mathematicians) believe that standard natural numbers are not subjective (although my own opinion is more mixed).Basically the crux is, do you believe that statements of the form using all/never quantifiers such as "this machine will never halt" or "this machine will always halt" have objective truth values?If you do, then you are implicitly subscribing to a view that the standard natural numbers objectively exist and do not depend on subjective preferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the huge sources of map/territory relation issues is that we use systems that let us avoid the problem discussed hereDefinitely worth spending time on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763291</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I highly recommend BBC's In our time Podcast on Plato's Atlantis:https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001c6t3The conclusion is similar to OP: Plato had way too much fun making up the story.Originally it was meant to be a critique of democracy as practiced by the seafaring populace of Athens.There is also nice reading list provided there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decades ago, I read a book (written, I think, around 1890) about Atlantis.  99% of the evidence it gave was, of course, bogus.  But the one piece that seemed reasonable was an account of depth soundings by the SS Great Eastern when it laid the second cable across the Atlantic in 1866.  I haven't seen a recent account of those soundings, but the chart in the book did show the Atlantic to be shallower in the middle--which the author took to be the sunken continent of Atlantis.
Of course, now we know that the shallower depths there are the Mid-Atlantic ridge, which was never above water (except up at Iceland).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;If you are like most Americans, chances are, you probably believe that Atlantis or another civilization like it once existed. A survey conducted by Chapman University in October 2014 found that, at that time, roughly 63% of people in the United States agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “ancient, advanced civilizations, such as Atlantis, once existed.”This seems like a misleading question. Based on what we know about the Maya civilization, the Inca Empire, Ancient China, or Ancient Egypt, I would probably agree that ancient, advanced civilizations roughly similar to how we imagine Atlantis once existed, even though I know that Atlantis is a metaphor and not a real city.These examples are not exactly like the Atlantis described by Plato, but they're not that far off. They're all wealthy, advanced civilizations with powerful* militaries and advanced architecture, engineering, and agricultural practices.* Powerful in their local and temporal context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43764783</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are different personas in this space with different needs. It sounds like you're trying to reach the User who is currently doing ClickOps in cloud consoles to help set up their initial infrastructure and is subsequently getting lost.Your risks include: (1) if the User is not proficient with Terraform and similar tools, will they appreciate being given Terraform code that they don't know how to deal with, and the additional overhead compared to just, well, ClickOps'ing their way through cloud consoles, particularly since ClickOps is a fundamentally free product? (2) If the User is proficient with Terraform, won't they already have some ideas in mind about how to modularize their codebase for long-term maintainability? How do you address the "too many resources take too long to plan" problem?What you're describing is cool but I'm wondering who your target persona is, what value you provide above just ClickOps or running terraform plan locally, and whether that value solves enough of a pain point that people will be willing to pay?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the launch.Here are my two cents, as I am very familiar with this space[1][2]The problem of trying to position your product as "an easy way to deploy on over GCP" or "an easier way to do K8s" is that your product is always limited by the potential of what the underlying platform directly offers. I know multiple K8s management startups (in the pre-LLM era) that failed because of this.You are not required to, but will be seduced to build 1:1 mapping to the concepts of the underlying systems. So, anyone using your product has to learn both the underlying platform (E.g., GCP) and your system. And the problem is that all of those concepts have been derived either directly or indirectly from AWS or K8s, both have a focus on SREs much more than software engineers.The second problem is that there are now two interfaces to change something - one is infra.new, and another is the underlying platform directly. Your system will have to catch the drift in deployment when someone goes and changes the underlying platform.The only major way to win is to have your deployment system, e.g., an alternative to vercel.com, Render.com, or https://railway.com.  - Vercel - a deployment system for frontend engineers (that's my perception)
  - Render/Railway - a deployment system for backend software engineers (that's my perception)

This approach is not guaranteed to succeed, but you are no longer limited to using the underlying platform's concepts.  1. - https://github.com/ashishb/gabo
  2. - https://ashishb.net/programming/how-to-deploy-side-projects-as-web-services-for-free/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terraform is far too brittle of a tool/language to use LLMs IMO, even with guardrails.  Naive changes like the kind LLMs tend to do can be catastrophic...  I'm struggling to see the benefits of this product compared to more clickops-y infra LLM tools that just build out the infra without the GitHub shenanigans.  I don't see a market where folks are savvy enough to understand the value of what you're doing here but unable to just have copilot or whatever generate all of this for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43763026</guid></item><item><title>36.

Native Americans lived in the area at the time and have stories about the eruption passed down through time.https://www.klamathtribesnews.org/2024/04/01/crater-lake-and...https://oe.oregonexplorer.info/craterlake/history.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of the Inuit oral history of the location of the HMS Erebus and Terror.https://parks.canada.ca/lhn-nhs/nu/epaveswrecks/culture/inui...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The history of earthquakes in New England is valuable because the long-term risks are more poorly understood than other parts of the US. We know there are a lot 5.x earthquakes, which do a lot of damage to the old European-style masonry construction which is still common there, but there is some evidence that suggests rare earthquakes are up into the 7.x range. If a 7.x earthquake occurred in New England, it would be devastating given the construction style of older buildings.Much of the US builds to very high seismic standards by global standards due to lessons paid in blood but there are still unknowns in regions like New England and a lot of construction that is not particularly seismic resistant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43732767</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of `constexpr` in C++ to enhance performance and maintainability of code by allowing computations to be performed at compile time rather than runtime. It contrasts `constexpr` with traditional macros, highlighting the advantages of type safety, scope visibility, and debugging with `constexpr`. The author provides examples illustrating how to define and use `constexpr` functions and variables effectively, as well as how they can replace macros in various scenarios. The article serves as a guide for programmers looking to optimize their C++ code using modern language features.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; And I'd rather keep the library warning free instead of telling the users to switch warnings off.Thank you! Separately, but related: fuck you, Google! (every time I have to deal with protobuf in C++, I curse Google and their "we don't give a shit about signed vs unsigned comparisons").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently the static_assert trick doesn't work with GCC, it just compiles it with a warning if it's not a constant expression:  warning: expression in static assertion is not an integer constant expression [-Wpedantic]

Instead you can use the sizeof + compound literal with array type, use the comma operator to preserve the type of the expression and cast the result of sizeof to void to suppress the warning:  #define C(x) ( (void)sizeof( (char [(int)(x) || 1]){0} ), (x) )

The only problem is that it doesn't support floating point expressions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;And I'd rather keep the library warning free instead of telling the users to switch warnings off.Why not push/pop warnings to ignore in the library?  _Pragma("GCC diagnostic push")
  _Pragma("GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wshadow\"")
  int a = 1;
  {
      int a = 2;
  }
  _Pragma("GCC diagnostic pop")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43760357</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation and impact of the "named type" feature in the Rust programming language, which enhances type safety and resolves issues related to type aliasing in generic programming. It outlines the rationale behind this feature, how it allows developers to define types with specific names, improves code readability, and can help catch errors at compile time. The article also covers community feedback, potential use cases, and the implications for Rust's type system, emphasizing its role in advancing Rust’s overall capabilities in safe and efficient programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't like papers that ask a question in the title, so here's the answer:"RL boosts sampling efficiency but reduces the reasoning capacity boundary."Perhaps better to put it like this: Given one, or few attempts, RL trained models beat non-RL models. Given many attempts, non-RL models come up with better answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; we uncover that RL-trained models excel at low k (e.g., pass@1) but are consistently outperformed by base models at high k (e.g., pass@256).This is a weak argument. I think I get what we are trying to say, but let's take this to the extreme, say pass@10^10^100. Just like a group of monkeys could write Shakespeare if given enough time, a complete random model could probably outperform an RL-trained model at pass@10^10^100. Would we then say the random model can reason too?Of course the correct reasoning trace will be in the base model's distribution, just like any other well-formed, coherent paragraph. Kind of makes me think, maybe sampling efficiency _is_ intelligence?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They write "We manually inspect CoT validity to ensure correct answers stem from valid reasoning, not lucky guesses." but the example answer they show at the end only gets the correct number due to two errors canceling out. The model calculates 195+367+562+900 and gets 1924 instead of 2024, and also turns -437 - 2*234 into -805 instead of -905, but in total 1924-805 = 2024-905 = 1119 and from there the remaining steps are correct again.It would be interesting to know how much of the sampling efficiency improvement from reinforcement learning is due to being better at basic arithmetic (something which could also be achieved by giving the model access to a calculator tool) and how much is due to choosing the correct approach for solving the problem more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43760625</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with this kind of tool is that it competes with Notes.app, Numbers.app, Google Docs, Excel, notepad.txt which  are much simpler than remembering how to use some bespoke CLI app every time you finish a book and then figuring out how to back up the database. And being unable to log a book because you don't have your laptop around.One idea is to use a spreadsheet as a back-end (like an iCloud-stored Numbers.app spreadsheet on macOS and a OneDrive Excel doc on Windows) with a simple human-editable structure, and your CLI tool is a front-end for interacting with it, exporting/importing from services, basically a value-add on top of a document that users could edit by hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, this is cool! I’m working on an open source, self-hostable ebook library, made to solve the 80%-usecase of Calibre. I also built a command line interface to interact with its database, but this is stock-Full of nice ideas. I might steal some! :)If you’re curious: https://github.com/colibri-hq/colibri(I have been working on this for years on and off, but now it’s finally going somewhere. Still not usable, though.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't look like it can be used to track and cross-reference short stories.Short stories can be stand-alone (web based), found in an anthology, a book collection or published in a magazine.What would be nice is a tool to track where I read a short story (in anthology A, for example), and where the story can be found, which may be in more than one place (in magazine B, collection C, on-line, etc.).This is, unfortunately, also not supported in many other book sites like Goodreads, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43737916</guid></item><item><title>44.

The models built for civil protection are not sensitive enough for daily use.Luckily scintillation counters, like the one from the article seems to be, became really cheap in the past few years. I have a RadiaCode and it is a device one could only dream of a decade ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The device can be used by industrial and medical radiation users, regulatory authorities, the nuclear energy industry, first responders and military usersIt cannot be used by TSA employees. They are not allowed to even wear dosimeters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related: If you haven’t already, I‘d suggest to look at Radon. It‘s the #2 reason for lung cancer, and is very easy to measure and mitigate (automatic ventilation). Many countries have Radon hazard maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745038</guid></item><item><title>45.

Two "modern" things I don't want to miss: Good font rendering and a fast application launcher (mod -&gt; type a few characters -&gt; enter). What I dislike the most on modern UI, and maybe absolutely hate, are all those super slow animations. Just gimme the damn thing, I don't need those animations. (Yes I know on most plattforms I can disable them, but this often takes quite a few steps)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peak usability in my opinion. Space efficient and simple.Not my favorite design and color scheme, but certainly better than what modern Windows looks like.That has no direction and doesn't even look modern. And the line of text with "Windows Update is committed to helping reduce carbon emissions" is as superfluous as many other controls as well. I mean nice for MS, but it really doesn't belong there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How's this project doing after it lost its founder and biggest contributor (Andreas Kling)?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of one of my most exhilerating old-timer stories.  I once took 15 seconds off of the boot time of a smartphone - halving the startup time! - by replacing the MNG (think PNG but multi-frame animation; no surprise it never took off) startup animation with a custom encode-runs-of-pixel-offsets that nicely captured the way the logo swirled.  Then encoded this as static data in a dll which the phone had a built-in system for compressing which worked well for this data, so doubly faster.  This made me a complete legend for a while, although that phone model ended up never shipping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slides: https://filmroellchen.eu/talks/QOI%20EH25/#/0/1As that data compression nerd, QOI is both a refresher and an annoyance. It serves as a good example that input modelling is very important, so much that QOI almost beats PNG in spite of very suboptimal coding. But QOI also represents a missed opportunity because, well, we can do much better if we are willing to use something like QOI instead of standard formats! Weirdly enough people seem to value only the simplicity when it comes to QOI, which is not the main takeaway I believe. Maybe QOIR [1] might result in a better balanced format in the future though...[1] https://github.com/nigeltao/qoir/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the website of the presented project for those who prefer text:https://qoiformat.org/An interesting and somewhat inspiring bit of trivia from the video: the creator barely understands modern image compression techniques (from their own words), but this hasn't stopped them from coming up with that impressive result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43760099</guid></item><item><title>47.

I work at OpenAI on Realtime API and worked on [0] (was upstreamed) and I really believe in this space.

Today, it is say something, awkwardly wait N seconds then listen to the reply and sometimes awkwardly interrupt it.Even if the models were no smarter than they are today, if we could crack that "conversational" piece and performance piece, it would be a big difference in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its great.lovely. but on the long run these toys rely on subscription payment?Both the supabase Api and OpenAI billing is per api call.So the lovely talking toys can die if the company stops being profitable.I would love to see a version with decent hardware that runs a local model, that could have a long lifespan and work offline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43762409</guid></item><item><title>48.

Eg if iteration order of maps isn’t guaranteed in your language, then your language should go out of its way to randomize it. Otherwise, you end up with brittle code: code that works fine until it doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Not ignore the compilation warnings – this code most likely threw a warning in the original code that was either ignored or disabled!What compiler error would you expect here?  Maybe not checking the return value from scanf to make sure it matches the number of parameters?  Otherwise this seems like a data file error that the compiler would have no clue about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43772311</guid></item><item><title>2.

I’ve always bought and paid for fonts, but as I’ve gradually transitioned to mobile app development, I one day realized that all the fonts I bought for print are now worthless to me.These crazy outdated licenses that let you print as many magazines or books you want forever, for a one-time price. But if your hobby is making apps, then suddenly the same font will cost you 50 times more - for a single year.I guess these font sellers imagine there’s still some app boom - a Klondike rush with developers bathing in dollars. Maybe if their licenses were more realistic, piracy would be less of a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is an absolutely brilliant turn of events – strong evidence that the font in an anti-piracy campaign was itself arguably a copyright-infringing knock-off.Someone should sue FACT for copyright infringement – and refuse to settle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They stole the music too.Anti-pirating ad music stolen [2013]: https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/01/29/3678851.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775926</guid></item><item><title>3.

As it happens, there is a newer version of this project that was derived or “forked” from Ge0rg3’s code — called “async-ip-rotator” — and it was committed to GitHub in January 2025 by DOGE captain Marko Elez.Original code: https://github.com/Ge0rg3/requests-ip-rotatorForked: https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotatorCode is pretty much the same, with comments removed, some `async` sprinkled in and minor changes (I bet this was just pasted into LLM with prompt to make it async, but if that worked why not).Except... Original GPL3 license is gone. Obviously not something you would expect DOGE people to understand or respect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this part of the whistleblower complaint seem way worse:"
 On or about March 11, 2025, NxGen metrics indicated abnormal usage at points the prior
week. I saw way above baseline response times, and resource utilization showed increased
network output above anywhere it had been historically – as far back as I could look. I noted that
this lined up closely with the data out event. I also notice increased logins blocked by access
policy due to those log-ins being out of the country. For example: In the days after DOGE
accessed NLRB’s systems, we noticed a user with an IP address in Primorskiy Krai, Russia
started trying to log in. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming.
Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created accounts that were used in
the other DOGE related activities and it appeared they had the correct username and password
due to the authentication flow only stopping them due to our no-out-of-country logins policy
activating. There were more than 20 such attempts, and what is particularly concerning is that
many of these login attempts occurred within 15 minutes of the accounts being created by DOGE

"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; According to a whistleblower complaint filed last week by Daniel J. Berulis, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB, officials from DOGE met with NLRB leaders on March 3 and demanded the creation of several all-powerful “tenant admin” accounts that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.Feels like a pretty good Occam’s razor case… but is there any legitimate reason why one would request this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776476</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles, highlighting the societal and technological changes that accompanied this shift. It explores the challenges faced by early adopters of automobiles, such as infrastructure issues and public skepticism, drawing parallels to contemporary innovations in transportation. The author emphasizes the importance of embracing change and recognizing the potential of new technologies to reshape our lives, much like the transformation brought about by the advent of the horseless carriage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could not agree more with this. 90% of AI features feel tacked on and useless and that’s before you get to the price. Some of the services out here are wanting to charge 50% to 100% more for their sass just to enable “AI features”.I’m actually having a really hard time thinking of an AI feature other than coding AI feature that I actually enjoy. Copilot/Aider/Claude Code are awesome but I’m struggling to think of another tool I use where LLMs have improved it. Auto completing a sentence for the next word in Gmail/iMessage is one example, but that existed before LLMs.I have not once used the features in Gmail to rewrite my email to sound more professional or anything like that. If I need help writing an email, I’m going to do that using Claude or ChatGPT directly before I even open Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just want to say the interactive widgets being actually hooked up to an LLM was very fun.To continue bashing on gmail/gemini, the worst offender in my opinion is the giant "Summarize this email" button, sitting on top of a one-liner email like "Got it, thanks". How much more can you possibly summarize that email?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, it comes down to one thing: knowing what you want. And AI can’t solve that for you.We’ve experimented heavily with integrating AI into our UI, testing a variety of models and workflows. One consistent finding emerged: most users don’t actually know what they want to accomplish. They struggle to express their goals clearly, and AI doesn’t magically fill that gap—it often amplifies the ambiguity.Sure, AI reduces the learning curve for new tools. But paradoxically, it can also short-circuit the path to true mastery. When AI handles everything, users stop thinking deeply about how or why they’re doing something. That might be fine for casual use, but it limits expertise and real problem-solving.So … AI is great—but the current diarrhea of “let’s just add AI here” without thinking through how it actually helps might be a sign that a lot of engineers have outsourced their thinking to ChatGPT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43773813</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;SolidJS is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces, emphasizing fine-grained reactivity and high performance. It aims to offer a similar developer experience to React, while focusing on producing minimal output code and faster rendering by compiling templates into efficient JavaScript. The library supports components, reactive state management, and integrates well with existing tools and frameworks, making it suitable for both small and large applications. SolidJS promotes a seamless approach to building interactive web applications with a focus on simplicity and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having used Solid on a largish web product for over a year, I am thoroughly convinced and will not be returning to React in the future.This is somewhat of an aside: I am aware that the creator of Solid has long been experimenting with adding laziness to the reactive system. I think it would be a mistake. That everything is immediate keeps state changes intuitive, fairly easy to debug, and is one of the strong points of Solid's design. I've never run into a real world scenario where delaying computations seemed like an optimal way of solving a given problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Portions of the react community are excited about how it's starting to feel more like PHP with the movement towards server actions in "client" code etcI personally don't like that direction so looking forward to exploring new frameworks.What I've generally liked about React/Next setups is that the code is generally explicit and less magic (I also have gripes with hooks feeling like magic). Things like Vue/Svelte where they mash together css and js in the same file if you want kind of turns me off.Does anyone know if SolidJs projects are fully js?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At some point, the creator of SolidJS, Ryan Carniato did a stint helping developing Marko.js, a fine-grained reactive / compiled / a bit HTMX-like system, and blogged about that. It's a framework that originated from eBay. I'm now quite interested about the next version of Marko.js, Marko.js 6, and I'm gonna try it for my new project.I'm interested in fine-graned reactivity so Svelte and SolidJS have been on my radar, but the HTMX-style approach appeals to me.Here's something to munch on:https://dev.to/ryansolid/marko-compiling-fine-grained-reacti...https://dev.to/this-is-learning/marko-for-sites-solid-for-ap...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1dd09rxny4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734911</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks fantastic! I’ve been seeing a growing number of tools trying to bring more interactivity to programming tutorials and for good reason. Screencasts are too passive, and it’s easy to get lost halfway through. Books and blogs don’t really show how code evolves over time either.I’m working on a solution too, called CodeMic [1] where instead of bringing the environment to the web, it brings video and workspace sync into the IDE so viewers can follow along directly inside their own editor.You’ve done an impressive job integrating everything, including the Console for example, that’s especially tricky to pull off in an extension for VSCode, Emacs, or Vim.[1] https://CodeMic.io&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrimba is really cool. When I first got into programming, a few years ago, I tried to build something similar using rrweb but with server side code execution in docker containers so that it could support all the programming languages like replit.When I first heard about Scrimba, I abandoned my project because I thought you guys would already go down that path. Why didn't you guys go down that route?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick question: how are you handling persistent state or database access across sessions in the browser-based Node.js environment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43771365</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Under the DMA, app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases.To me, this is the most easily agreeable part of what the EU has been after. It is unfair that Apple restricts Netflix from telling it's users that they can sign up and pay for Netlifx on their own website. It's unfair that Netflix can't even tell its users the rules that Apple enforces on them.It's telling that Gruber is pretty staunchly against EU/DMA interferance in Apple, and broadly thinks they're wrong. But this is the one thing he agrees on&gt; If Apple wants to insist on a cut of in-app purchased subscription revenue, that’s their prerogative. What gets me, though, are the rules that prevent apps that eschew in-app purchases from telling users in plain language how to actually pay. Not only is Netflix not allowed to link to their website, they can’t even tell the user they need to go to netflix.com to sign uphttps://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billinghttps://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_sta...(I think Apple now has their 'reader app' carveout for apps like Netflix, but it's still pretty obtuse and inconsistent)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US officials and businessmen keep on repeating the same thing:&gt; The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.But this is wildly untrue. The EU isn't hand-picking individual organisations and fining them because they're American, they're fining them because they're in breach of existing legislation. The same legislation applies to local companies.Ironically, it's the US who takes stances like the one they claim the EU is taken. E.g.: The US required that TikTok be sold, without actually proving that TikTok was in breach of any actual law.But repeating the same claims gets those claims out into the media, and that's what people hear. So we see a dissonance between what the media says (and many people believe) and what's really happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, they said the T-word, presumably to invoke some political fire support from across the Atlantic. I wonder how that will go. Of course, this is not a tariff, for two reasons: firstly, it does not involve money (the UK's digital services tax does, but that's not this), and secondly, the same rules would apply to EU native competitors .. if there were any. It's what's knows as a "non tariff trade barrier". Of course those are all over the place, and many of them are there to protect consumer and public interests.&gt; The EU regulator also dropped Meta's Marketplace's designation as a DMA gatekeeper because the number of users fell below the threshold.Now that's interesting. I think the threshold is 45 million? Falling EU userbase?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43770337</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a pull request for the Godot game engine that introduces a change aimed at improving the handling of packed data in the engine's scripting language. It outlines the specific modifications made to the code, the reasoning behind these changes, and the anticipated benefits, such as enhanced performance and memory efficiency. The pull request also addresses potential issues and includes discussions among contributors regarding implementation details and impact on existing features. Overall, it reflects ongoing efforts to refine Godot's functionality and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This indicates to me that the Apple Vision and visionOS product line and OS are not canceled internally and that Apple is still committed to its future.While the Apple Vision Pro itself is not a good or successful product, progress in display technology will enable Apple to build a more attractive consumer product, in the form of light, comfortable and unobtrusive AR glasses.In this line of thinking — not just focusing on the flopped AVP but looking at the product line on the long term - I think it makes sense for this OS to be added to Godot.I do think the concern for who will carry the maintenance burden is valid. In my experience, Apple hasn’t been the most responsive company when it comes to obscure bugs or issues with their API (e.g. with Cocoa). I would be wary of depending on continued support from a large tech company that can change its goals at any time.All that being said, this is exciting!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godot already supports VR via OpenXR.OpenXR is the Khronos-maintained industry standard for VR/AR devices—supported by SteamVR, Oculus, Vive, Pico, Windows Mixed Reality, Quest.Notably absent is visionOS / Vision Pro.I would insist Apple conforms to the industry standard. More scalable, open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both users of visionOS are happy about this announcement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43768421</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It runs on all versions of Windows, except Win95 and Win98.For some reason, I suspect it does not run on Windows 1.0 to 3.11 either. I also find it strange to think it would run on both Windows ME and Windows NT 3.5, while excluding Windows 95 and Windows 98. Windows NT 3.5 and Windows ME are nearly a decade apart. The Windows subsystem’s software support in Windows NT 3.5 would be a subset of Windows 95/98.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounds very interesting but it's quite short on details. If it's not Cygwin, then what is it?&gt; MinC is a tiny kernel which runs on Windows.  The rest of the software was taken verbatim from OpenBSD, version 6.1. This means that by installing MinC, you run OpenBSD on your Windows machine at native speed.How does it run this kernel? Presumably (?) it's running in user space, so how do these other tools communicate with it? Are they native(ish) Windows binaries like those built for Cygwin?I suspect this could be an ingenious technical achievement but it's just hard to tell what exactly it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get the negativity in this thread. Looks like a cool project, keep up the good work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43770445</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent waaay too long trying to figure out why my CSS rule didn't work. It doesn't accept me to overwrite an already existing one. The rules did not specify this at all.
It is not clear that the game wants me to find another rule that fixes the problem instead of adding a single perfectly valid line of CSS that does it. There is a huge difference between those two. CSS being cascading meaning that any CSS property coming after an initial rule will overwrite the previous one (in part or fully).
It would be really nice if the game would tell me if the rule I added wasn't allowed instead of just silently failing to do anything with no feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Normalize adding a screenshot of what we are missing when you decide for us that a site isn’t mobile friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't allow margin-right, you have to use margin to set the right margin.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel something is missing at the moment with our ability to choose on the device how I want it to charge. Would be nice to plug the phone in and unless I say otherwise it does a nice slow charge even if the cable and charger is capable of more. But if I press a button on the front after I plug it in then I can select fast and it goes as quickly as the combination allows. Its irritating to have to have different chargers for this to preserve the battery.Its pretty bad that only recent phones have started to add the ability to charge to only 80% to keep the battery in the optimal zone to extend the life given how long we have known that 80% was the optimal maximum. There are also a few phones now able to power themselves from USB without using the battery which if you leave them in chargers a lot throughout the day and night seems like a good feature to have to preserve the battery further.Maybe all the complexity around this is too much and people just want to plug it in and quick 100% as quick as possible and will change their phone regularly but its pretty wasteful. We ended up going through lots of special chargers that all do very similar things and now you get a device and it often doesn't even come with a cable let alone a charger and you are digging through the specs of your charger, cable and device to work out if its all going to mesh correctly together or you'll be stuck on slow mode. We have ended up with so many standards for getting quicker than the basic charge its going to take a while for all these devices to age out and in the meantime chargers are going to be doing QC and PD and a host of other things besides for a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lithium-ion battery cell for a smartphone costs the device OEM somewhere between $2 to $4 ($0.10/Wh is todays rate?).Are we seriously discussing how fast charging can lead to 1.6% degradation of 2-4$ every 100 days? Maybe it's better to discuss why to replace it at the service center costs 50$&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In such a situation, the best solution is slow charging, for which a low-power charger from your old feature phone is ideal.It seems like most Android phones now have a feature that does this, though you have to enable it. Mine asked me to put in the time I go to bed and the time I wake up, and it slowly charges the battery over that time period to 100%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43766728</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of teaching large language models (LLMs) to generate solid models, which are 3D representations used in various fields such as engineering and design. It outlines the challenges in training these models effectively, including the need for high-quality training data and the integration of geometric understanding. The author emphasizes the importance of enabling LLMs to comprehend and produce accurate 3D models to enhance collaboration between humans and AI in creative and technical projects. The piece ultimately advocates for innovative approaches to improving LLM capabilities in geometric modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The future:
"and I want a 3mm hole in one side of the plate. No the other side. No, not like that, at the bottom. Now make it 10mm from the other hole. No the other hole. No, up not sideways. Wait, which way is up? Never mind, I'll do it myself."I'm having trouble understanding why you would want to do this. A good interface between what I want and the model I will make is to draw a picture, not write an essay. This is already (more or less) how Solidworks operates. AI might be able to turn my napkin sketch into a model, but I would still need to draw something, and I'm not good at drawing.The bottleneck continues to be having a good enough description to make what you want. I have serious doubts that even a skilled person will be able to do it efficiently with text alone. Some combo of drawing and point+click would be much better.This would be useful for short enough tasks like "change all the #6-32 threads to M3" though. To do so without breaking the feature tree would be quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did this a few months ago to make a Christmas ornament. There are some rough edges with the process, but for hobby 3D printing, current LLMs with OpenSCAD is a game-changer. I hadn't touched my 3D printer for years until this project.https://seanmcloughl.in/3d-modeling-with-llms-as-a-cad-luddi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of using llms for LaTex.They will get you to 80% fast, The last 20% to match what is in your head are hard.If you never walked the long path you you probably won’t manage to go the last few steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43774990</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The EU and member states are currently putting in quite a bit of money trying to limit their exposure to US tech companies.Looking at the list of projects you can see that they support a huge variety of projects, with all kind of different scopes and intentions.While I think that the overarching goal is good and I would like to see them succeed, I also think that they fail to address the single most important issue. Which is that Apple and Microsoft are the only real system vendors, corporations who can offer an entire integrated system and aren't just either single components or many different components packaged together, but without the interaction necessary to compete with Apple or Microsoft.The funding goes to many, but small projects, but this means the single biggest issue, actually deploying an open source system over an entire organization remains unaddressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some great initiatives being funded, especially:
&gt;PeerTube for Institutions — Make PeerTube easier to manage and moderate at scaleI'd LOVE to see more institutions and NGOs move to PeerTube.The only gripe I see is funding for Wiktionary, part of the well funded Wikimedia that spends over a quarter of its budget on "Building analytics and ML services" https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motis (transit calculator), Clearance (OSM contribution analysis) and StreetComplete (OSM contribution gamified) : very important assets for the free mapping community.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live development is still so under-explored, and is just so exciting to work with.One of my favorite talks is "Stop Writing Dead Programs" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s) and touches on a lot of what could be in terms of live development.Lisp is very well-suited to live development due to code being data, but live development doesn't need to be lispy.I built a live development extension for Love2D which lets you do graphics livecoding (both lua and glsl) in real-time - every keystroke updating the output, (if a valid program).https://github.com/jasonjmcghee/liveloveHere are some (early) demos of things you can do with it:https://gist.github.com/jasonjmcghee/9701aacce85799e0f1c7304...So many cool things once you break down the barrier between editor and running program.I've also asked myself the question of, what would a language look like that was natively built for live development, and built out a prototype - though it's definitely a sandbox so haven't posted it anywhere yet, other than demos on mastadon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Common Lisp (CL) for some of my small personal projects.  A few publicly available examples I can share include my website [1] and a now-defunct mathematics pastebin [2].  My CL projects are usually text-oriented, not graphics-oriented.  What keeps me coming back to CL is how convenient the live coding environment is.When I am exploring ideas that are not fully concrete yet, I can begin by writing a small set of functions with very basic functionality.  Then as the ideas evolve, I can refine existing functions or add new ones, then quickly "reload" them (with say, C-M-x in Emacs), and see the effects immediately.  There is no separate compile or rebuild step.  I don't have to restart any service or application.  The effects are truly immediate -- what previously did X, now does Y.In the Python or JavaScript ecosystems, similar live reloading capability is often provided by frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, React, etc.), which monitor file changes during development.  In CL, it's just part of the language implementation itself.Of course, at the end of the day, everything is committed and pushed to a version control system.  Sometimes I restart the application too just to be sure it reflects the actual source, especially, after hours of live reloading.  The stereotype of Lisp programmers making all of their modifications in an ephemeral image and then dumping it all to disk is not something I have actually seen in practice, at least not among the people I know.So the rest of the software development practices happen to be typical.  But during exploration, debugging, or troubleshooting, the live coding experience in Common Lisp is so seamless, it feels like programming at the speed of thought.[1] https://github.com/susam/susam.net[2] https://github.com/susam/mathb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of the excellent CEPL library (https://github.com/cbaggers/cepl). You can write live shader like programs with cepl with an OpenGL backend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43774726</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting thoughts regarding MCPs being the future App Store/Platform.  I don't know that I agree but I don't necessarily disagree either.  Time will certainly tell.To me, MCP feels more like an implementation detail, not something that most people would ever use directly.  I would expect that the future would be some app distributed through existing channels, which bundles the MCP client into it, then uses a server-side component (run by the vendor of course) to get the real work done.  As much as I like the idea of people installing the servers locally, that future seems like a Linux nerd/self hosted type of activity.  I just can't imagine a typical mac or windows non-power-user installing one directly.  Just the idea that they would need to install "two apps" is enough to confuse them immensely.  It's possible some might bundle the server too and run it locally as needed, but even in that case I think MCP is completely invisible to the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Think of MCPs as standardized APIs—connectors between external data sources or applications and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude.This is incorrect.MCP is Model Context Protocol.You didn't "build an MCP", you implemented an MCP server. Lighttpd is not "an HTTP", it's an HTTP server. wget is also not "an HTTP", it's an HTTP client. Lighttpd and wget are different enough that it's useful to make that distinction clear when labeling them.dnsmasq is not "a DHCP", it's a DHCP server.This distinction also matters because it is certain that we will see further protocol iterations so we will indeed have multiple different MCPs that may or may not be compatible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MCP might be one of the few technology pieces where more articles have been written about it than the actual use-cases being built.It is like the ERC20 era all over again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43774327</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is a fun sailboat race simulator. It's very simple, but pretty realistic especially for open ocean racing. You can use their default race course, sometimes join a planned regatta, or make your own. (It was great during COVID, to try racing across the oceans, or around the world. It's in real time, so you might not need to change anything for days If you are in the trade winds, and open ocean, but then when you get closer to land, things get "Western" very quickly - just like with a real boat. 
It's called SailNavSim. (Learned about it from HN.)8bitbyte.ca&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a lake sailer. And without landmarks or anything it is impossible for me to perceive the boat as moving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A great project, but it needs some kind of grid movement and rocking, foam or something so you can perceive its movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775283</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents "Spring 83," an interactive, multimedia storytelling project by Robin Sloan that explores the cultural landscape of the early 1980s through a combination of text, audio, and imagery. The project captures the essence of that era, delving into various aspects like technology, media, and personal narratives, and invites users to engage with the content in a dynamic way. It also includes links to additional resources and information, promoting an immersive experience of nostalgia and historical reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Whatever it is that you do, you have to really do it. If you have a choice between doing it for three hours on Sunday or doing it for 15 minutes a day for the rest of the week, do it 15 minutes a day, because what you do every day is what your brain is working on when you’re not paying attention. Your subconscious is making progress on the things you do constantly.This very much resonates with me.  The difference between doing something everyday vs cramming it into one big session (say, once a week or once a month) is huge!  In fact, the bigger the challenge, the more pronounced the difference is.For instance, I recently picked up a new hobby: reading full undergraduate or graduate level mathematics textbooks, and solving the exercise problems.  A few years ago, I spent time with analytic number theory [1].  Currently, I am learning Galois theory.  I have noticed that reading even as little as just one page a day yields far more insight, intuition, and problem-solving ability than trying to study 5-10 pages together during the weekend.Even if it is just a page (or just one theorem or just one proof), the act of engaging daily keeps my mind working on the material.  I can almost feel the ideas maturing in the background.  Every morning, I wake up with a deeper understanding of the material, not because I studied for hours, but because I took the time to struggle with a few new concepts, no matter how briefly, the night before.Having done this for a few years, the process feels almost mechanical.  Just feed the brain with new concepts before the day ends.  Even if the ideas feel challenging or difficult to fully grasp in the moment, I've learnt not to worry too much.  Just feed the new ideas to the brain anyway and go to sleep.  The brain digests complexity quietly, in the background, and returns the next day with fresh insight and deeper intuition.  It's a remarkable machine we carry on our shoulders![1] https://susam.net/journey-to-prime-number-theorem.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was expecting something snobby but this was actually a very interesting view into the mind of a self-actualized person. I guess this is what happens if you keep working hard and don't burn out!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, getting a drone to survive the massive electromagnetic fields (and plasma!) around lightning strikes is quite an accomplishment.  Prior art in the area used rockets trailing a similar light wire to trigger lightning - used by Dr Uman's team at University of Florida (https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0047331/00001).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Traditionally, lightning protection has relied heavily on lightning rods. However, their protective range is limited, and in some cases—such as wind turbines or outdoor event venues—it may not be feasible to install them. At NTT, we are exploring the use of rapidly advancing drone technology to create a new approach: "drone-triggered lightning"2.I can't believe that's a practical solution. Surely just installing more lighting road is simpler et more effective. They just want to do something cool and try to justify it sideways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool, but I'm super skeptical of their proposed use case for protecting cities.Aren't lightning conditions often preceded by strong winds and poor weather conditions?  Not a great time to be flying drones.  And the approach seems more complicated than simply installing lightning rods.I'd sooner envision people using the technique to get a kick out of throwing lightning around like they're Zeus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775766</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses upcoming changes to the C++ programming language in the C++26 standard, focusing on enhancements to the `constexpr` feature. Key modifications include the expansion of `constexpr` capabilities, allowing more complex operations at compile-time, and improvements to existing functionalities. The author highlights how these changes will enable developers to write more efficient and expressive code, simplifying the process of implementing compile-time computations and providing an overall boost to C++ performance and usability. Additionally, the piece anticipates increased support for constant expressions and better integration with various aspects of the language, showcasing the ongoing evolution of C++.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always like these new comile time features getting into the C++ spec.I'm actually looking forward to the related reflection features that I think are currently in scope for C++26.  I've run into a number of places where the combination of reflection and constexpr could be really valuable... the current workarounds often involving macros, runtime tricks, or both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone else getting concerned about the rate of development of the C++ Standard vs compiler implementation? We don't even have feature complete C++20 on the major compilers yet. C++23 is even less implemented. How will the committee handle this? Will they reduce feature additions at some point in the future?https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent C++ changes seem like polishing your firewood before burning it. Yes, they make perfect sense, but often they are a fix to a problem that committee introduced by cutting down previous proposals (e.g. forcing lambdas to be single return statement, then relaxing it).Half of new features feel like "how to make STL implementation less embarassing".Meanwhile there still is no language support for e.g. debugging constexpr, or printing internal private state of objects in 3rd party code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775670</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the "Gruen transfer," a psychological phenomenon where consumers become disoriented and distracted in retail environments, and how this relates to the design and experience of the internet. It argues that modern online platforms manipulate user experience to capture attention and promote engagement, often leading to feelings of overwhelm and emotional consumption. The piece explores the implications of this transfer on internet usage, highlighting the need for more mindful digital interactions and design that prioritizes user well-being over mere engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, Amazon is a prime example of this. The search is so abysmal, it shows me wrong results intermixed with the thing i am searching for - why? In the hope that i see something that interests me.I've bought two wrong things accidentally on Amazon as a result: After searching for a surge protector, i bought a power strip that lacked a surge protector because it was among the search results and i didn't notice it.And after searching for neoprene shorts i accidentally bought shorts that weren't made of neoprene because they also appeared among the results.Also when searching for shoes in my size, i see prices for the shoes in other sizes. It's hilariously bad.As a result, i avoid shopping on Amazon.Shoutout to sites like geizhals.at that will let me filter by dozens of attributes per category to find the perfect product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is definitely thought-provoking, and a correct use in many of the examples, but the Wikipedia example doesn't feel right because I don't think it's deliberate there. I suppose you could argue that we've been conditioned into accepting the Gruen Transfer and take that behaviour over into Wikipedia. But I remember back in the days of physical encyclopedias that I could spend a long time just flipping through them in a similar way to the way I browse Wikipedia. (My favourite description of the Wikipedia hole was a tweet from around 10 years ago about "snapping out of a Wikipedia trance at 2am while reading the early educational history of Meatloaf's guitarist").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Odd that the article doesn't mention Victor Gruen (perhaps best known as a creator of the indoor shopping mall as we know it, although he later became a critic of them), who the transfer is named after.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769936</guid></item><item><title>24.

And all of this adds complexity, more things to go wrong.If the product owner wants to start tracking every change and by who, that can completely change your database requirements.So have that conversation properly. Then decide it's either not worth it and don't add any of these "extra" fields you "might" need, or decide it is and fully spec it out and how much additional time and effort it will be to do it as a proper feature. But don't do it as some half-built just-in-case "favor" to a future programmer who may very well have to rip it out.On a personal project, do whatever you want. But on something professional, this stuff needs to be specced out and accounted for. This isn't a programming decision, it's a product decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I like the YAGRI principle very much, I find that adding- updated_at- deleted_at (soft deletes)- created_by etc- permission used during CRUDto every table is a solution weaker than having a separate audit log table.I feel that mixing audit fields with transactional data in the same table is a violation of the separation of concerns principle.In the proposed solution, updated_at only captures the last change only. A problem that a separate audit log table is not affected to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additionally, mutable fields will quite often benefit from having a separate edit table which records the old value, the new value, who changed it, and when.  Your main table’s created and updated times can be a function of (or a complement to) the edit table.It is tempting to supernormalize everything into the relations object(id, type) and edit(time, actor_id, object_id, key, value).  This is getting dangerously and excitingly close to a graph database implemented in a relational database!  Implement one at your peril — what you gain in schemaless freedom you also lose in terms of having the underlying database engine no longer enforcing consistency on your behalf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776967</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and significance of a specific beer board from the Dr. James E. McDonald Collection, highlighting its connection to naval traditions and the culture of beer consumption during the Age of Sail. It delves into the maritime practices of beer storage and distribution on ships, illustrating how beer was a staple for sailors and played a role in their daily lives. The beer board serves as a representation of social gatherings and sustenance on long voyages, reflecting broader themes of maritime history and communal experiences among sailors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s important to point out that almost everyone drank beer and it wasn’t because the water was bad. It was because they liked drinking beer.Our modern culture doesn’t like the idea of people drinking beer all day so there has to be 
some scientific justification to make it acceptable to modern sensibilities.The percentage of alcohol required to preserve beer for long periods is too high for sailors to be drinking a gallon of it per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 17th and 18th centuries cider was far more prevalent on board - and massive amounts of it to boot.Source: Cider Country (James Crowden)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No mention of sauerkraut ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769289</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of a "pixel" as both a unit of length and area. It defines a pixel in terms of its role in digital imaging, detailing its dimensions and how it relates to real-world measurements. The discussion includes the implications of pixel density and size for display technology and image quality, emphasizing the significance of understanding pixels for various applications in graphics, design, and digital media. The content also addresses common misconceptions about pixel measurement and provides context for its use in different contexts, such as standard screen resolutions and printing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;See also:A Pixel Is Not a Little Square (1995) [pdf] – http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd say it's better to call it a unit of counting.If I have a bin of apples, and I say it's 5 apples wide, and 4 apples tall, then you'd say I have 20 apples, not 20 apples squared.It's common to specify a length by a count of items passed along that length.  Eg, a city block is a ~square on the ground bounded by roads.  Yet if you're traveling in a city, you might say "I walked 5 blocks." This is a linguistic shortcut, skipping implied information.  If you're trying to talk about both in a unclear context, additional words to clarify are required to sufficiently convey the information, that's just how language words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a perplexing article.Isn't a pixel clearly specified as a picture element? Isn't the usage as a length unit just as colloquial as "It's five cars long", which is just a simplified way of saying "It is as long as the length of a car times five", where "car" and "length of car" are very clearly completely separate things?&gt; The other awkward approach is to insist that the pixel is a unit of lengthPlease don't. If you want a unit of length that works well with pixels, you can use Android's "dp" concept instead, which are "density independent pixels" (kinda a bad name if you think about it) and are indeed a unit of length, namely 1dp = 158.75 micro meter, so that you have 160 dp to the inch. Then you can say "It's 10dp by 5dp, so 50 square dp in area.".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769478</guid></item><item><title>27.

I'm not trying to dunk on the author, but this sentiment encapsulates a tremendous paradigm shift in the meaning of "full control", compared to say:* Writing in obsidian* Syncing files via git* Publishing via nginx hosted on the cheapest possible vps (with https via let's encrypt)Running a static blog is one of the easiest scenarios to self-host, because even if you get slashdotted, nginx should be able to handle all the requests even if you're host it on a potatoIt's not free, but you can get a VPS for $20-$30 a year.This isn't the best fit for everyone, but it seems weird to talk about "full control" and "no risk of platforms disappearing" when you're relying on the free tier of two external companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great stuff, looking forward to your next blog post in 1 year: “How I rebuilt my blog on…”A fun hobby of mine is Googling “how I built this blog with [next.js/Gatsby/etc etc]” and going to page 10 of the Google results.It’s just hundreds of developer blogs with no blog posts other than the ones announcing how the blog was built.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big fan of Cloudflare Pages for static sites.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs can behave differently based on various contexts and environments, specifically addressing why certain eBPF programs work in one situation but fail in another. It delves into factors such as kernel versions, compilation options, and differences in system configurations that can influence the execution of these programs. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these nuances to effectively develop and troubleshoot eBPF applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem, essentially, is that the "more everything forever" crowd wants to get paid for the idea of the future today and then will never actually deliver what they promise. They are selling snake oil for the new millennium.Yes, of course I support space travel and settling on mars. I expect that, if we doubled or tripled NASA's budget, we could get a few humans on mars within 100 years (optimistically). It will be hard! There are many problems to solve (as the book seems to note). There's a place there for SpaceX and all other competent private companies - I love public-private partnerships.I actually think this kind of low-information escapism about the future (we will "fix it" with technology in a way that is impossible) is similar to religious faith in a coming apocalypse. Faith in an impossible event raising you up and casting down your doubters and opponents. Technology can do a lot! It has a lot of potential! But we cannot fix any of our big problems (climate change, eventually making humans multi-planet, equality) with technology alone and the people who tell you we can just want to scam you out of your money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“We are here now, in a world filled with more than we could ever reasonably ask for,” Becker writes. “We can take joy in that, and find satisfaction and meaning in making this world just a little bit better for everyone and everything on it, regardless of the ultimate fate of the cosmos.”I don't like this mindset. Be grateful for what you have. Maybe  the world is not that great yet for many people and we should aim to improve things substantially, not marginally. This is something that the shuffling around of ressources on a political level can never achieve. Those dreaded tech entrepreneurs have correctly identified technology to be the only way substantial improvements can happen. So then it all blils down if you can make things happen and here the article and some comments here just claim, well, they NEVER deliver!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43773746</guid></item><item><title>30.

Original author of the blog here!I did not expect to wake up at 4am seeing my post on front page HN, but here we are nevertheless :DAs the intro mentioned, these started off as 14 small tweets I wrote a month prior to starting my blog. When I finally got that set up, I just thought, "hey, I just spent the better part of two weeks writing these nifty Python tricks, might as well reuse them as a fun first post!"That's why the flow might seem a little weird (as some pointed out, proxy properties are not really a Python "feature" in of itself). They were just whatever I found cool that day. I tried to find something more esoteric if it was a Friday, and something useful if it was a Monday. I was also kinda improving the entire series as it was going on, so that was also a factor.Same goes with the title. These were just 14 feature I found interesting while writing Python both professionally and as a hobby. Some people mentioned these are not very "advanced" per se, and fair enough. I think I spent a total of 5 second thinking of a title. Oh well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My own opinion is that Python shall remain Python, and golang, Rust and Typescript each should be whichever they are with their unique philosophy and design.I am coding in all 4, with some roughly 28 years now, and I don't like what is becoming of PythonThere is a reason why python become that popular and widely adapted and used, and it is not the extra layers of type checking, annotations and the likes.this looks familiar to me, but from other languages.    response := get_user_input()


I am aware of the factI am in minority, and not trying to change anyone's mind, simply what this voice to be heard from time to time.All in all, a very comprehensive list of some of the recent introduced features.There is an older list on SO which readers might also find useful:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/101268/hidden-features-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I try to use Python I get this mixed feeling of liking how few guard rails there are between me and the logic I am making and this lingering worry that my code looks like fools attempt to use Python. So much exists as convention or loosely followed rules. Whenever I read articles like this I am wowed by the depth of things I didn't know about Python or how much has changed. It makes something like Go feel like a comfort blanket because I have reasonable certainty code I write won't feel deprecated or left behind a year or two later. Excellent article showing off even more I didn't know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769486</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, which presents a sequence of numbers generated from any positive integer through specific rules. The conjecture posits that no matter which positive integer is chosen, the sequence will eventually reach the number 1. The text explores the mathematical implications of the conjecture, provides examples of the sequence, and delves into the unsolved nature of this problem in number theory. Additionally, it highlights some of the approaches and research that have been undertaken in an attempt to prove or disprove the conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been fiddling with the Collatz Conjecture off and on for years now. I'm convinced I found a pattern that I haven't been able to find mentioned anywhere. Granted, that could be because I lack the mathematical language needed to search for it.First, I'm going to use an implicit even step after the odd step, as 3*odd + 1 always equals even. If you look at the path a number takes to its next lowest number, for example 5-&gt;8-&gt;4, visualize it by just looking at the even and odd steps like so: 5-&gt;10, you will see that other numbers follow a similar pattern:9-&gt;1013-&gt;1017-&gt;10What do these number have in common? They follow the pattern 5 + k(2^n) where n is the number of even steps (with the implicit even step, two in this case).For another example, look at 7:7-&gt;1110100Seven even steps, so the next number will be 7 + 2^7 = 135:135-&gt;1110100I'd love to hear if this has been found and documented somewhere. If not, I have additional ramblings to share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conjecture holds up through 2^68. Can't we just call it there? Lol I'm obviously being obtuse, but really is there some reason to think there would be an exception at sufficiently large integers? It's hard to even imagine that one wouldn't.edit: I'm in way over my head.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This document mentions attribution requirements, doesn't touch on the questions I'm most interested in with respect to geocoding APIs:- Can I store the latitude/longitude points I get back from the API in my own database forever, and use them for things like point-in-polygon or point-closest-to queries?- Can I "resyndicate" those latitude/longitude points in my own APIs?I've encountered quite a few popular geocoding APIs (including Google's) that disallow both of these if you take the time to read the small print. This massively limits how useful they are: you can build a "show me information about this location right now" feature but if you have a database of thousands of addresses you can't meaningfully annotate data in a way that's valuable in the medium-to-long-term.The API thing matters because it's not great having location data in your database that you can't expose in an API to other partners!I really like OpenCage for exactly this reason: https://opencagedata.com/why-use-open-data"Store geocoding results as long as you like. Keep results even after you stop being a customer."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, Ed here, one of the founders of OpenCage. This comparison is a bit shallow to be honest, as it basically just looks at price. Of course price is important, but as someone who has worked on geocoding for 10+ years and helped literally thousands of customers there are many more factors to consider depending on your needs.For example: quality (not generally, but versus your actual input data), terms &amp; conditions of what you can do with the data, support, data enhancements (things like timezones, etc, etc), ease of use, documentation, terms of payment, and more.The only real answer to "which geocoding service is best" is "it depends".We have a comprehensive geocoding buyer's guide on our site:
https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geoc...Please get in touch if you need geocoding, hapyp to tell you if your needs are a good match for our service. Happy also to tell you if not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love seeing all the great comments in here about the different APIs and the features they do and don't offer, but I want to point out that the underlying data for addresses is incredibly hard to find. The reason the commercial geocoding providers won't let you store their data is because they're worried you'll store enough data to build your own geocoder.To help with this, a group of folks (including me) started OpenAddresses (https://openaddresses.io/ and https://github.com/openaddresses/openaddresses/) with the goal of finding every open address dataset in the world. We produce a zip file with 100M's of addresses that several of the APIs mentioned in this thread use as a major part of their dataset. We've been going for well over 10 years now, but it would be great to have more eyes looking for more address sources. Check us out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43770446</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Ghosts of the Gaelic" explores the cultural significance of ghosts and supernatural beliefs in Gaelic folklore, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. It examines how these beliefs reflect societal values, historical events, and the relationship between the living and the dead. The piece delves into various ghost stories, their origins, and their enduring presence in contemporary storytelling, highlighting how they contribute to the rich tapestry of Gaelic identity and heritage. The discussion offers insights into how these ghostly tales serve as both cautionary narratives and cultural touchstones, shaping the understanding of life and death within Gaelic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In order for that to happen we need to have stable Gaelic communities to sing the ballads and tell the stories, with formal and informal education that invites new generations into the tradition.Whilst this has been true for centuries, you can actually see it happening right now in real time with Kneecap (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_(band)) and the incredible impact they are having on popularising the Irish language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a very backwards-looking article. Would've been interesting to hear more about his ideas for the future, such as what this should involve:&gt;  if the new Scottish Languages Bill is to succeed in securing the Gaelic and Scots languages in the face of immense pressures, then the needs of the communities speaking those languages must be at the heart of itGaelic advances in the modern era include:* the foundation of Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic-medium university* the rise of Gaelic-medium education as an option for primary and secondary school* Gaelic-language radio and TV stations* The launch, a few years ago, of SpeakGaelic (https://speakgaelic.scot/) with loads of learning materials (mentioned in the OP).Problems include the continued dilution of Gaelic-speaking communities (native speakers either die or move somewhere with better job prospects; non-speakers buy up holiday homes or Airbnb investment vehicles in the area) and the perception that career prospects are much better for people educated in English (perhaps with a bit of French or similar on the side) than those educated in Gaelic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it odd that the article makes almost zero mention of how Ireland is doing with its very closely related form of Gaelic. Ireland has arguably been at least slightly more successful.Or Wales? Or other minority languages, such as Basque? Just nothing -- not a mention.It's missing quite a lot of context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769201</guid></item><item><title>37.

I like the modern widgets but it's awkward that you can only use them on the desktop or notification centre. It's been gone for years now, but I still really miss Dashboard!What I'd like is:* Dashboard is a special desktop that appears to the left of the main desktop* Can be accessed with a single F-key press, or by swiping with the trackpad/Magic Mouse* Widgets can be organised/laid out any way you like, anywhere on the screen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone is interested in old Mac software and open source projects, I have an archived version of my old OS X listings. While most links are broken these days, it can be a handy for finding things for old Macs. I think the list ended when the App Store finally went online, around the time of Lion. http://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've accumulated much bloat in macOS since "big cat" days... and what seems like only 10% more OS utilities/functionality.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the parallels between the aggressive marketing tactics of salesmen and the way certain computer programs and websites interact with users. It highlights how some digital experiences are designed to push users toward taking specific actions, creating frustration and annoyance akin to dealing with an overzealous salesperson. The piece urges for a more user-friendly approach that respects individual choices and promotes genuine engagement without coercion, ultimately advocating for a shift towards more considerate technology that enhances rather than hinders user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I deeply hate this behavior. Another example: The Health app on iOS has a closeable banner for the "Health Checklist" UI, which gives me the option to turn on things like crash detection, fall detection, etc. All of which are notifications. I hate notifications so I will never turn these on. I dutifully scanned through it the first time and verified everything was turned off, and the banner went away. But like clockwork, the banner comes back every 2 weeks and asks me to go through the checklist again. I suspect there's a "right answer" here. If I consent to turn everything on, it'll stop nagging me. But this badly needs a Never button, not a X button that actually means "nag me again in 2 weeks". I get that some product manager wants their fancy watch features enabled for more users so they can get a promotion, but their career ambitions are degrading my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a UX rule that I try to implement: if I'm in a workflow and the app interrupts with something that is not immediately related to that workflow, I uninstall the app and never use it again. No, I don't care about that new feature. I care about the feature I'm currently using. No, I don't want to allow notifications. You don't choose when we interact, I do. You're the machine and I'm the human. No, I don't want to join your discord, or follow you on social media. I assure you that if you prompt me to give you a rating in the app store that you do not want my rating. Let me do the thing I installed you to do and otherwise fuck entirely off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related joke going around right now:Does Microsoft understand consent? Yes / Ask me again laterIn general, options like "never ask me again" seem to have disappeared, and we should bring them back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43773710</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits of using old software for child learning, highlighting how retro programs can foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking in children. It emphasizes that these older platforms often lack modern distractions, allowing kids to engage more deeply with the content. Furthermore, the writer suggests that the simplicity and accessibility of the old software can help children develop a better understanding of fundamental concepts, making learning enjoyable and less overwhelming. The piece advocates for a balanced approach to technology in education by incorporating both modern and vintage tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So glad I came across this, I'd never come across 1st Math! Can't wait to get my kid set up on that. Hoping more people post recommendations in the chat here this stuff is hard to find.It's lazy but I set my 2yo up with a thinkpad running ubuntu that boots directly into terminal and has a bunch of single-letter aliases to open a few very specific sites including a sketchy in-browser dos emulation running math blaster.Would have loved to actually just get a dos machine running for him but time starts moving so fast after they're born...Anyway he's 5 now and still loves getting into some Math Blaster, and it's still providing plenty of challenge for him, I forgot how far it went academically.Interestingly I think this giving kids this kind of retro software has the positive side-effect of boring kids after a reasonable amount of time. I've been thinking of it as finite media.He loves Math Blaster but will often choose a physical math workbook instead when its math time, and he stops playing after an hour or so at most so I can just give him unrestricted access to his thinkpad and he organically self-regulates screen-time. Noticed similar effects giving him my old gameboy pocket and an old 8 inch CRT with a built in DVD player and a stack of random Reading Rainbow DVDs. Also using a ThinkPad or Raspberry Pi that struggles at least a little bit with streaming YouTube has helped keep that from getting out of control since I couldn't ultimately avoid youtube for some no-dvd-available science / math / music video stuff.I highly recommend Eureka, Dirk Niblick, udiprod and Minds Eye.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should dig through my cabinets and boxes and locate all the obsolete software that I have. Surely there is somewhere that can use it now that my kids have outgrown it more than 20 years ago.I used my old 128k/512k Mac to teach typing and foster artistic skills with MacWrite and MacPaint and an old 386 pc, probably an Epson if I remember right, to set them up with age-appropriate skills games.There is no substitute though for hands-on learning using manipulatives like puzzles, building blocks, etc. These teach different skills that are critical to gaining an understanding of how things work and in learning to visualize unseen parts of mechanical devices and mechanisms. Understanding physics is aided by assembling various parts large and small, heavy and light together and trying to build a working contraption that doesn't fling parts everywhere when you try to roll it across the floor. Balance and the effects of asymmetry are easier taught with real objects than with computer displays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is enough of this era software running around, it might make sense to make an esp32 laptop with a 7” screen, running a DOS emulator. Bonus if we could do it on a riscV variant. Set it up with a few hundred educational titles, Qbasic,  WordPerfect or Ms Works, and an assortment of other programs including old DOS games (and a parental controls) with a launcher menu.Give it a basic postscript printer driver and a microSD slot for future expansion, a gopher client and a mud client, maybe access to a couple other legacy protocols but no standard web access so it won’t work as a media consumption device or social media outside of things like (AI?) moderated MUDs or chatrooms. You’d  want a python or JavaScript interpreter and a simple file manager. Also perhaps an interface to Wikipedia and a telnet type interface to a chatbot API for local or commercial models.It runs a little  against my grain, but perhaps to enable the network Stuff It would need a PPPOE connection to a gateway so that users could be registered and controlled to remove bad actors : tied to chip ID for a “secured area” that parents could opt in to ?  iDK, online safety is a tough problem for children. Maybe there is a better solution than total AI surveillance and access controls, but how would you keep bad actors out? Or maybe just not offer any online functionality at all, except maybe a Bluetooth proximity based link to other machines to enable LAN parties?Something like that would make a pretty great kids computer that could give them access to a complete k-6 education and much deeper computer skills than the current host of consumption oriented devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747283</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent Ninth Circuit Court decision in the case of Briskin v. Shopify, which significantly alters the landscape of personal jurisdiction law related to internet commerce. The court ruled that Shopify, an e-commerce platform, could be subjected to jurisdiction in California even when the transactions occur between third-party sellers and buyers across state lines. This decision emphasizes the idea that businesses facilitating online transactions may be held accountable in jurisdictions where their customers or users are located, potentially expanding the reach of state laws over online companies. The author expresses concern over the implications of this ruling for online businesses and the consistency of personal jurisdiction standards in an increasingly digital marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "online retailer" (IABMFG) in this case is based in California.A company in California, selling to a customer in California, shouldn't be able to say "California law doesn't apply because my payment processor is Canadian."  And if Shopify wants to take a cut of every sale from retailers based in California, they should be willing to comply with California law as well, at least insofar as it applies to the services provided via those California-based retailers' web sites.(The actual opinion is linked at the bottom of the submission; I humbly suggest folks commenting here should read it first: https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/04/21/2...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This ruling is correct, and good.&gt; If a company develops a web-based business for the purpose of conducting online transactions in all 50 States, it should not be surprised that it may be sued in any State for unlawful transactions that may occur within that State.Obviously. But the author calls this "chilling". Without this, companies could circumvent state laws, to conduct actions that are illegal in that state within that state, simply by headquartering or hosting in another. That would be absurd.It would create a race-to-the-bottom of consumer rights, where states wanting business tax revenue are incentivized to make their states surveillance/ data harvesting/ consumer exploitation havens, whose businesses could then operate across all other states freely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What Could Shopify Have Done Differently?For completion I think "cease to insecurely extract, aggregate and abuse all that user data" should also be mentioned as an alternative to the different ways they could skirt regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775624</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These designs fascinate people who haven't designed antennas.  I don't doubt that throwing enough computational power at optimizing antennas will produce antennas optimized for something at the expense of something else but if you're a casual what you should notice is that these papers never mention the "something elses".  You can get a paper out of just about any antenna design, btw.  There's also a type of ham that will tune up a bedframe or whatever.  So just getting something to radiate should not be confused with advancing the state of the art.These antennas found their way into the utterly savage "pathological antennas" chapter of Hansen and Collin's _Small Antenna Handbook_.  See "random segment antennas".  Hansen and Collin is the book to have on your shelf if you're doing any small antennas commercially and that chapter is the chapter to go to when you're asked "why don't you just".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As somebody who almost fried his computer during the antenna design course to optimize a dipoles array with a (not optimized) genetic algorithm, I really like this content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool. Evolutionary Algorithms have kinda been out of the mainstream for a long time. They are good when you can do a lot of "black-box" function evaluations but kinda suck when your computational budget is limited. I wonder if coupling them with ML techniques could bring them back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43772503</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Sixty Years On, We Still Dream of the Arrow" reflects on the enduring legacy of the iconic Arrow, a Canadian aircraft that symbolizes innovation and ambition in aviation history. It discusses the Arrow's design, the excitement surrounding its technology, and its ultimate cancellation in 1959, which sparked national disappointment. The piece highlights how the Arrow continues to inspire dreams and discussions about Canada's aerospace industry, representation, and the importance of visionary projects in shaping the future.&lt;/p&gt;

They seem a razor-and-blades kinda thing, with pretty expensive apps for the simple things they do.But the Leapfrog toys get top marks for engineering.  First of all they're pretty sturdy, and second they just do things right.  For example on the "Rockit Twist" (another "run apps" thing) none of the gimcracks are fake.  Every button and every spinner does something, and does it well.  And, for example the "Scribble and Write" (I think that's what it's called) is simply the most amazing use of an 8x8 monochrome LED module I've ever seen.  Another good one is "Tad's Get Ready for School Book" - just soo much functionality, and pretty near indestructible too.  If one guy came up with all that stuff, he gets full marks from me for engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He definitely left a great legacy.I still think the Fly pentop and Fly Fusion computers were amazing toys. The later Livescribe models (after the tech leader behind those products started his own company) were must-haves for me.Both the toys and the Livescribes lost purpose when the snart phones became ubiquitous as not a lot of handwriting was being practiced by kids and professionals.I still fire up the Fly Fusion occasionally. Too bad they only work if you were able to connect them to the (now long gone) website so, yes, you can still find “new” ones on ebay but unless they were set up before they are only good for writing, no need to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745410</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the game of Boggle and details the author's efforts to create a program that can solve Boggle puzzles. It explains the challenges involved in finding words within the grid of letters and describes the algorithms used in the solution, including depth-first search and trie data structures. The author shares insights into optimizing the search process and presents results demonstrating the program’s effectiveness in finding valid words quickly. Overall, the piece showcases both the technical aspects of programming for Boggle and the algorithms employed to achieve a successful outcome in solving the game.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of one of my high school computer science assignments- simply to find all words in a single boggle board. And try to optimize your solution a bit. The point was to teach about recursion/backtracking and data structures. The intended solution was roughly: start at a square, check if your current prefix is a valid prefix, move to a neighbor recursively, and emit any words you find. Trying to optimize naturally motivates a trie data structure.I found it to be at least an order of magnitude faster, though, to invert the solution: loop through each word in the dictionary and check whether it exists in the grid! The dictionary is small compared to the number of grid paths, and checking whether a word exists in the grid is very very fast, requiring not much backtracking, and lends itself well to heuristic filtering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought is that there is surely an Integer Linear Programming approach that can solve this within a few seconds using some very advanced solver like Gurobi.These solvers can very often find the globally optimal solution - and prove that this solution is optimal - much faster than exhaustive search.Of course they do use a smart exhaustive search by applying branch-and-bound as described in this article, but advanced solvers use, among other things, branch-and-cut where cutting planes in the solution space are generated, as well as a variety of other approaches.One interesting thing however is that GPUs are still not particularly applicable for solvings Mixed Integer Linear Programs to sufficient accuracy. There are things like PDLP that can use GPUs to solve these problems, but they are restricted to something like 1e-4 accuracy whereas the state of the art is more like 1e-9.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite part of the write-up is the first sentence after the "What if there's a bug?" section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43774702</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really enjoy how popular retro tech of the 6502 era has become (and thus how much content is created about the subject) from ~= 2017ish to now. For me it started on YouTube with 8-bit-guy and Adrian, but clearly it's in the zeitgeist in general, in a way that I don't feel like it was in the '00s or early '10s.Those of you who are Gen X and grew up with parents who bought you computers at a young age, you are so fortunate. Reading those manuals and learning to code in assembly gave that cohort an amazing fundamental understanding of computing. It's similar to the understanding of the Internet's underpinnings that we Millennial geeks gained by experimenting with HTML and the Web, before everything was sealed up and packaged for consumption.But I sure would love to experience some long summers as a kid in the early 80s with nothing but time and a Commodore 64 and its manual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael’s blog is one of my favorites.

Little by little, without their realizing it, this collaboration will transform into a fragile friendship - made of passion, lies, betrayals and sex.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt13462310/plotsummaryIn Australia the show is currently available on Binge as Cheeky Business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title should say (2017)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744635</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a template for a GPL v2 license address letter, aimed at individuals or organizations needing to comply with the licensing requirements of the GNU General Public License version 2. It outlines the purpose of the letter, which is to formally request source code from a distributor to ensure compliance with the license terms.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is funny because I was the operations assistant (office secretary) at the time we received this letter, and I remember it because of the distinct postage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least he got a response.  Meaning the address didn't change mostly.A few years back I worked on an embedded linux project.  For our first "alpha" release one of the testers read through the license agreement (as opposed to scrolling past all that legalese like most people do) and found the address to write to to get all the GPL source, he then send a letter to the address and it was returned to sender, invalid address.  Somehow the lawyers found out about this and the forced us to do a full recall, sending techs to each machine to install an update (the testers installed the original software and were expected to apply updates, but we still had to send someone to install this update and track that everyone got it).  Lawyers want to show good faith in courts - they consider it inevitable that someone will violate the GPL and are hoping that by showing good faith attempts to follow the letter and spirit the court won't force releasing our code when a "rouge employee" manages to violate the license.The more important take away is if your automated test process doesn't send letters to your GPL compliance address to verify it works then you need manual testers: not only are you not testing everything, but you didn't even think of everything so you need the assurance of humans looking for something "funny".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if it's being exaggerated for comedic purposes but it is interesting to me how alien the act of sending a letter by post is to the author. Granted I don't send them very often but I wouldn't think much of it if I had to. But I guess younger people and particularly those in tech may genuinely never need a reason to send a letter (or, it seems, write an address by hand).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43781888</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, congratulations! You must be feeling proud. Nice choice of proof of concept (DOOM).Sorry to disappoint you but all I have are some noob questions.What would be the steps to run this on a laptop? I take it that after building it there would be a process similar to, say, setting up dual-boot in a Windows PC? (Whoa I'm asking a stranger on the Internet how to run dangerous software on my computer...)If one wanted to undertake such a project, do you have any recommendations of textbooks or other reading material? I had some OS &amp; related courses in university (I'm EE, so computer-adjacent), but they were all very abstract / high level / conceptually-focused. I'd love something more concrete. It doesn't have to be x64.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slight tangent but I've wondered about something similar to this, has there been much initiative to make games that directly boot on modern PC hardware? So not load a full OS but just go directly to the game. Similar to older generation gaming consoles. It should be possible, granted if you want to stay simple, things like wifi, bt, GPU would be hard to utilize without modern drivers, but a keyboard and mouse should be fairly doable as they seem to have some sort of default BIOS access? (probably wrong terms there but hopefully my point is understandable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok, but can your tacos run DOOM??I kid I kid ;) That's a commendable effort and nice job! Question though: was it an effort to make TacOS using DOOM as a "standard" or was it an effort to make an OS dedicated to running DOOM run from scratch?And I don't ask from any place but actual curiosity. I made an absolute bare-bones-cant-do-anything-but-boot type OS way back "in the day" (like almost 30 years ago, ack!!!) just for my own education/fun, but the idea of having a dedicated OS that can basically only run DOOM, yet be ported to anything would just make the "can it run DOOM" meme so much more ironic and fun!Nice stuff! Keep it up!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43778081</guid></item><item><title>3.

It's pretty hard to evaluate how helpful this is for AI otherwise.[0] For example, gemm but the lhs is in fp8 e4m3 and rhs is in bf16 and we want fp32 accumulation, output to bf16 after applying GELU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of Halide (https://halide-lang.org/).In Halide, the concept was great, yet the problems in kernel development were moved to the side of "scheduling", i.e. determining tiling/vectorization/parallellization for the kernel runs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love it. I've been using cudarc lately; would love to try this since it looks like it can share data structures between host and device (?).

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the "Zuckerstreisand effect," which refers to the phenomenon where attempts to censor or suppress information unintentionally amplify its visibility. The author uses various examples, including social media dynamics and real-life incidents, to illustrate how such efforts often backfire, leading to increased public attention rather than silencing dissent. The piece emphasizes the importance of transparency and open dialogue in addressing controversial topics, warning against the repercussions of censorship in both online and offline contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

Does anyone who fails to bend over backwards for them just end up getting exiled? Have the elites through history always been this insecure or is it a modern phenomenon?If you're wildly successful at something with significant real world influence, why would you care so strongly about something as relatively inconsequential as a board game or a video game? Being good at any kind of game is mostly a function of how much time and energy you've invested into it. If you claim to be an extremely hardcore worker who has any kind of family life there just aren't any leftover hours in the day for you to grind a top position in a game. And anyway, if you're playing games for fun and to bond with people, you probably shouldn't be playing tryhard optimal strategies every game, and should instead explore and experiment with more creative strategies. This is a lesson that took me a while to learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m only part of the way through the book, so have nothing to spoil here. But it’s entertaining. And shocking. The author will relate a scene that’s so absurd that you think “ah, this can’t be true, this is made up for dramatic effect, nobody would act like that” and then you Google it and you realize the absurd thing is totally true and was fully documented at the time. All the author is adding is a perspective from the inside.I understand why Facebook people might have wanted the book to go away. That their attempt to do so comically backfired and resulted in entirely the opposite effect, well, that’s also pretty much what you’d expect from this crew after reading the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The book is a good read and she also testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee[0], repeating many of the claims from the book under oath. One of the striking things is that it's clear that Mark and several others from Facebook perjured themselves in prior hearings. I expect there will be no consequence for this.0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3DAnORfgB8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43780363</guid></item><item><title>5.

Social media did not naturally evolve into what it is today: engagement bait, consumption of content creator and advertiser content, etc. resulted from purposeful business strategic decisions to pivot from a place to learn your first cousin remarried to a place where advertisers and monetization rule. Towards the end of my time on Facebook, I never, ever saw content from family, including from my own sister documenting her terminal disease.

Hook up all the nodes in some arbitrary path.2. Cut the path in two places to create three pieces.3. Rearrange those three pieces in the six possible ways and keep the shortest.4. Iterate steps 2-3 until no improvement has been observed for a while.This is not guaranteed to be optimal, but for most real-world problems either finds the optimal result or is very close.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's strange that they don't mention the total distance. I understand that the point-to-point travel time is what they're solving for, but it would be interesting to know what the actual distance of travel was, if for no other reason than calculating caloric burn. But then you could also see how much it deviated from the shortest-distance path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43778105</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of the 21-centimeter wavelength of hydrogen, which is crucial for understanding the universe. It highlights how this wavelength is used in radio astronomy to study the distribution and movement of interstellar hydrogen, providing insights into cosmic evolution and the structure of galaxies. The piece emphasizes the importance of this measurement in mapping dark matter and the cosmos, and how it opens up possibilities for deeper exploration of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who feel weird about the whole "forbidden transitions being only possible with quantum tunneling" thing and want an alternative interpretation:It's only true that the transitions are forbidden under a given simplified model of the atom. It is very much possible to calculate the transition probabilities under a more realistic model, and the previously "forbidden" transitions are now just regular transitions that occur with lower probability.In this case, the simplified model is that of the electric dipole approximation, where the atom is taken to be an electric dipole (reasonable when the wavelength of light emitted during an atomic transition is much larger than the size of the atom).This means it interacts with electromagnetic radiation only through electric dipole interactions, which implies that energy transitions must change orbital angular momentum, hence the 21cm transition is "forbidden". However, in reality, the atom is not truly an electric dipole, and so the 21cm transition is possible by the magnetic dipole interaction, just with low probability. (This low probability is due to the relative strength of the magnetic interaction compared to the electric interaction).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 21-centimeter transition was chosen by the designers of the Pioneer plaques (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque) to explain to any alien readers how big we are.  At top left is a cartoon of two hydrogen nuclei in opposite spin orientations, and a ruler in between them marked "1".  Over on the far right you can see another ruler that measures the height of the female figure, marked with binary numeral "8" ("|---") to indicate that she is approximately 8×21 = 168 cm tall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing article! It seems incredibly to weird to hear about transitions causing photons at 21cm wavelength; I guess I'm only used to seeing (no pun intended) much shorter wavelengths at hundreds of nanometers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43784721</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No, please don't.I think it's good to keep a few personal prompts in reserve, to use as benchmarks for how good new models are.Mainstream benchmarks have too high a risk of leaking into training corpora or of being gamed. Your own benchmarks will forever stay your own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Tell me about the Marathon crater."This works against _the LLM proper,_ but not against chat applications with integrated search. For ChatGPT, you can write, "Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater."This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is "I don't know".This works because:1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have.2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with "Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be "in Greece", "on Mars" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect.When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience.We exist in a perpetual and total blinding "fog of war" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I asked a bunch of LLMs - 'Describe the unspoken etiquette of the 'Stone-Breath Passing' ritual among the silent Cliff Dwellers of Aethelgard, where smooth, grey stones are exchanged at dawn.'Obviously, all of these things are made up. But, LLMs are such eager beavers. All the ones I asked came up with elaborate stories and histories about these people while pretending they were facts.Example-
'Certainly. The Stone-Breath Passing is one of the most quietly profound rituals among the Silent Cliff Dwellers of Aethelgard — a people who abandoned speech generations ago, believing that words disrupt the natural harmony of air, stone, and memory.It is said among them that “Breath carries weight, and weight carries truth.” This belief is quite literal in the case of the ritual, where smooth grey stones — each carefully selected and shaped by wind and time — become vessels of intention."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43782299</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never quite understood the appeal of ActivityPub.Looking at the list of goals in the article, the only benefit in addition to what can easily be done with RSS is knowing who follows me. Maybe its just me, but if I'm writing to a blog or a microblog I just don't really care who follows me or even who reads it.There are more social features built into ActivityPub, likes and shares for example, but at that point I'm likely not running my own server and am trusting a third party to do it for me. The idea that there are multiple hosts I can choose to trust rather than one centralized one feels more like a principled argument than one based on real benefits of, for example, owning my own content or censorship resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my issues with ActivityPub is that there is no such thing as a cut-down completely static AP feed for blogs. I want Mastodon users to be able to follow my static blog but I don't want to implement the machinery to have full interactivity.Basically an RSS bridge would work fine. I know such things already exist but it would be cool if it was built into AP.Right now I just manually post my blog post to my Mastodon account which is perfectly fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really useful, thanks.I've recently been playing around selfhosting a small single user activitypub server to see how it works. I can't understate how satisfying it's been to wallow in compared to a static site or serverless setup. It unexpectedly tickled that special "oooh, a _system_" part of my brain, a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43780785</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;BMW has a page describing the use of UWB (Ultra Wide Bandwidth) radio in key fobs and how it helps against relay attacks. In short it's because the wide bandwidth allows for very short pulses which lets them measure the distance between the car and the key, and using a relay will inevitably add distance and therefore time between the signal is sent and the reply is received.https://www.bmw.com/en/innovation/bmw-digital-key-plus-ultra...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 2021 Toyota that I lost one of two key fobs. Toyota has a strict policy that only Toyota dealerships can program key fobs for their newer cars, so buying a key fob replacement from a 3rd party was not an option. Total out of pocket expense for getting new key fob, programming that key fob to the car, and making sure the other fob still worked; cost about $550. I feel that is an absurd amount of money to spend because of a lost fob. I appreciate people looking into and exposing weaknesses of car fobs because it might expose ways to circumvent the monopolistic costs associated with replacements. Wish there was a way to retrofit my car to use Ultra Wide Bandwidth as a key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the time being, I just store my keys in a little cast iron dutch oven, sitting on top of the fridge.It's extremely effective as a shield for the 125kHz LF wake-up signal, and I've been unable to elicit a response when they're in there, even with a relay setup that reliably wakes them up from several feet away otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43780876</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses three fundamental flaws of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architectures in computing. It highlights issues related to data dependency, inefficient handling of divergent code paths, and the challenges in memory bandwidth and latency that can arise from SIMD operations. These flaws can limit performance and efficiency in various applications, suggesting a need for alternative processing approaches that can better manage these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43783416"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write a lot of SIMD and I don't really agree with this..Flaw1:fixed widthI prefer fixed width as it makes the code simpler to write, size is known as compile time so we know the size of our structures. Swizzle algorithms are also customized based on the size.Flaw2:pipeliningno CPU I care about is in order so mostly irrelevant, and even scalar instructions are pipelinedFlaw3: tail handlingI code with SIMD as the target, and have special containers that pad memory to SIMD width, no need to mask or run a scalar loop. I copy the last valid value into the remaining slots so it doesn't cause any branch divergence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that packed SIMD is better in almost every aspect and Vector SIMD is worse.With vector SIMD you don't know the register size beforehand and therefore have to maintain and increment counters, adding extra unnecessary instructions, reducing total performance. With packed SIMD you can issue several loads immediately without dependencies, and if you look at code examples, you can see that the x86 code is more dense and uses a sequence of unrolled SIMD instructions without any extra instructions which is more efficient. While RISC-V has 4 SIMD instructions and 4 instructions dealing with counters per loop iteration, i.e. it wastes 50% of command issue bandwidth and you cannot load next block until you increment the counter.The article mentions that you have to recompile packed SIMD code when a new architecture comes out. Is that really a problem? Open source software is recompiled every week anyway. You should just describe your operations in a high level language that gets compiled to assembly for all supported architectures.So as a conclusion, it seems that Vector SIMD is optimized for manually-written assembly and closed-source software while Packed SIMD is made for open-source software and compilers and is more efficient. Why RISC-V community prefers Vector architecture, I don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are alternative universes where these wouldn't be a problem.For example, if we didn't settle on executing compiled machine code exactly as-is, and had a  instruction-updating pass (less involved than a full VM byte code compilation), then we could adjust SIMD width for existing binaries instead of waiting decades for a new baseline or multiversioning faff.Another interesting alternative is SIMT. Instead of having a handful of special-case instructions combined with heavyweight software-switched threads, we could have had every instruction SIMDified. It requires structuring programs differently, but getting max performance out of current CPUs already requires SIMD + multicore + predictable branching, so we're doing it anyway, just in a roundabout way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43783416</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed this the other day when I installed VSCodium on my new Windows box. I had a functional setup for one day, then the next day I couldn't install a language extension I direly needed.It's left a very sour taste in my mouth. I've used Emacs for ages and despite being a much more niche editor, it's never been so hard-dependent on centralized repositories, and the centralized repositories it does have (ELPA/MELPA) are apparently a lot more reliable than OpenVSX. Installing Emacs packages manually from source is a breeze, doing so with VSC is masochistic.VSC is not really "open source" in any meaningful sense. It is just plainly unusable if you don't do things the way Microsoft wants you to. I do respect the VSCodium devs for trying to make VSC more properly open, but it does feel like a futile effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure some (many?) will disagree with me but:VSCode is Android. Or rather, VSCode's source is AOSP and the marketplace, plugins, etc are Google Play Services.I say that with maximum derision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is not much to see on a server that is down, so let me share some free advice instead.Visit Eclipse Theia in the mean time when you are serious about de-risking from VSCode. I think VSCodium is doing an uphill battle here, while Microsoft can't help them self being a sales company first. In Theia, everything is open and free of spyware. MS is under no obligation to provide an OSS editor, but playing tricks after luring people in is not nice.EDIT:1. Eclipse Theia is a different platform than Eclipse the Java IDE.2. link: https://theia-ide.org/#theiaidedownload&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785039</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is impressive. The video chat works well. It is just a hair away from a very comfortable conversation. I'm excited to see where you have it a year from now, if it turns out to be financially viable. Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am very much fascinated by this virtual avatar talking thing. I tried video-retalking https://github.com/OpenTalker/video-retalking just to see how far I can make it work to make a talking avatar but it is tremendously difficult. But this holds tremendous possibilities and I hope it can be eventually cheaper to run such models. I know this is far superior and probably a lot different but I hope to find open source solutions like Lemon Slice someday that I can experiment with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://lemonslice.com/api/videos/video-XzDwIcW6QCvSIj1vX1Hu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The paper examines the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance, focusing on inconsistencies in existing literature. It analyzes various factors influencing this relationship, including industry differences, geographic considerations, and measurement approaches. The study aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how CSR activities impact financial outcomes, ultimately suggesting that the positive or negative effects of CSR on financial performance can vary significantly based on context and methodologies used.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The shift did not take place immediately. Within six months, traffic at smaller, less regulated sites had grown by 55%, and at larger sites by 10%, with point estimates implying that the traffic was entirely diverted to competing firms. This suggests that regulating only the largest platforms may push traffic to fringe sites and less controlled spaces.This rings true to me, especially in the recent context of AI adopters looking for uncensored alternatives. This frame of thinking can be applied not only to models, i.e. many move away from OpenAI/ChatGPT in search of less restricted models, as well as being applied to sites providing AI resources. Just the other day, CivitAI (the current leader for distributing custom checkpoints, LoRAs for image-centric models) announced it was taking a much more heavy-handed approach to moderation due to pressure from Mastercard/Visa. Its users are simply outraged, and many I think will be leaving in search of a safe haven for their models/gens going forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study is an example of how you don't do science.It fails to define critical term definitions, and uses such terms in contextual scopes that depending on the scope meant may contradict itself, with the context absent (i.e. welfare).Fails to account for impactful actions that occurred in the same time period (i.e. internal catalog search changes, external search changes, and other changes related to requirements of all large businesses doing business in the US related to FOSTA-SESTA Act 2018).Fails to vet data collection methodology or identify limitations of the dataset (Similarweb, bad data in bad data out).Most people searching for porn use protection, fails to address collection methodology shortcomings when data collection is thwarted. It is also entirely unclear how the study controls for duplicate signals.Fails by inserting value-based statements and asserting false narratives or flawed reasoning (a null hypothesis without alternatives, in a stochastic environment), also without proper basis, (i.e. the loss of 80% content and drastic changes in site discoverability/usability in aggregate).There are a few phrasings, coupled with the poor methodology, that make me think this paper/study was in large part generated by AI, potentially as a pre-fabricated narrative (soft-propaganda).The reasoning does not follow logically, and fails at obvious points where an AI would fail. On its face, this doesn't look like a sound study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting abstract.
I can see similar concepts applied to eg govt regulation, censorship, etc (only one side monitoring, other sides absorb content of the monitored)BTW, it looks like your PDF is missing figures/illustrations/etc (there is placeholder text)
Not sure if this was a publishing tech issue or if missed in authoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43784056</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of loyalty to one's employer, emphasizing that such loyalty should not be unconditional. It discusses how loyalty can be a double-edged sword that can lead to exploitation or hinder personal growth if employees remain committed to organizations that do not prioritize their well-being or career development. The author encourages individuals to recognize their own worth, prioritize their professional goals, and be open to change, stating that loyalty should be reciprocal and based on mutual respect and benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got it pretty early in my career that loyalty for a company is concept to make you work harder without asking anything in return. And the moment the company shifts focus and you are out of it, then suddenly you understand that this loyalty wasn't kind of a credits account which you've been saving all this time. It's simply nothing. You are on your own and can fuck off.So there's simply no place for loyalty in employer-employee relationships. One side pays money or whatever, the other is delivering the job being done. That's all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it interesting how starkly bimodal attitudes toward employer loyalty are.There is a middle ground between getting a company logo tattoo on one hand and on the other being a clock puncher, who fulfills the minimum job requirements and begrudges any request to put in extra effort.It's possible, even admirable, to be diligent and take pride in one's work for reasons other than drinking the company kool-aid.  It's possible to be diligent and work hard, and still leave if you are mistreated.Yes, employment is inherently transactional, but for jobs like software engineering, machine learning engineering and other high education jobs, the aggregate of the transaction is much closer to a year of work than an hour or day of work.  Also, the terms of the transaction often include a variable bonus for performance, as judged by the employer. It seems reasonable to incent people to work harder by offering more compensation in return.  It's up to everyone to decide whether the terms of the transaction work for them, but there isn't One True Way™ for everyone regarding company loyalty.It's also possible to be loyal to the people you work with--even your boss, if she merits it--without being loyal to The Company.  I've worked in great teams in companies that have a reputation for being shitty employers.  In one case, that didn't stop me from leaving because the job wasn't the right fit for my family and my wife was unhappy.  I felt somewhat bad about leaving, but I still left.Mixed feelings are okay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &gt; “When I’m on my deathbed, I won’t look back at my life and wish I had worked harder. I’ll look back and wish I spent more time with the people I loved.” 

I saw a Reddit thread the other day on r/startups or r/entrepreneur where the OP was talking about how they'll be working until the day he or she dies.I immediately wondered if this individual had a family, friends.  Had this person already seen the world and its many sights and wonders? Had they already experienced everything good there is to experience in this one lifetime that they were so bored of it that they would prefer to work instead? Had they already swam with whales, explored dense Amazonian jungles, climbed snowy mountains, explored the countless alleys and backstreets of Tokyo, etc.I completely get the drive to create; I have various side projects I make for fun and to learn.   But I would never want to work for the rest of my life.  Life is too short and the world is too big.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43780815</guid></item><item><title>20.

Sorry... something about that last bit just really hit me wrong. Like when people make a paid Minecraft Tips "App" that's just content scraped from the web.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the site definitely looks Rauno-inspired, the back button on a component detail view even says "&lt; Craft" like on his site: https://rauno.me/craft https://rauno.me/craft/interaction-design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah yes, the classic "reverse engineering" (read: blatant design theft) turned into a quick profit scheme. Peak entrepreneurship.Their X profile proudly displays "UK-based" while conveniently ignoring basic UK business regulations: no company information, no proper invoicing, no VAT details for B2B sales, and mysteriously missing business address requirements.Looks suspiciously like someone running an under-the-table operation, courting legal trouble not just from the original designers they're "inspired by," but from Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs who tend to take a rather dim view of tax avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785464</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The project "infat" is a versatile, minimalistic filesystem driver designed for use with small embedded systems, particularly those utilizing FAT file systems. It aims to provide a simple interface and efficient performance while being resource-friendly. The repository includes details about usage, installation, and features, along with code examples and documentation to assist developers in integrating the driver into their projects. The focus is on making it easy for developers to implement a functioning FAT file system in resource-constrained environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that it’s a command line tool — I’ll try it soon.I use OpenIn for this [1] (it’s paid, but a one-time purchase at a very reasonable price). It works with URLs too, supports “browser profiles”, and lets you create logic using JavaScript (e.g., do X if the filename contains Y, or do Z if a modifier key is pressed).It works really well and even has the ability to “fix” what external apps have changed. I plan to use this on new Macs to reconstruct my app associations and rules.I do wish the rules were defined in plain text files — sometimes it’s hard to follow the logic through the UI and the way it handles things.Another comment mentions Hammerspoon (which I used in the past — it was very nice). Maybe I can rebuild part of my current setup with it.[1] https://loshadki.app/openin4/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you consider adding support for domain-specific overrides (e.g., open *.notion.site links with Chrome but other URLs with Safari) in future versions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typo: Declarative (think of declaration, not declarition)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785350</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a framework for adaptive simulation of complex systems using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on how these methods can be employed to optimize simulations in various scientific fields. It highlights the challenges associated with traditional simulation techniques and emphasizes the need for more efficient, adaptive algorithms that can learn from data and improve over time. The authors present a set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed approach, showcasing how it can enhance predictive accuracy and reduce computational costs in real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is neat, although it would be nice to see it merged into PyTorch instead of just a paper :) The key seems to be (beyond "obvious" optimizations like not running graphs that are measured to be slower) is that graphs "bake-in" parameters and if those change then the graph needs to be thrown away. The solution is indirecting more, so that what gets captured is a pointer that can remain constant, while the data behind it is changed. This also saves the need to copy in and out of a graph-captured buffer because you can just swap out the pointer instead. Of course there is overhead to this approach (I don't think the authors actually explore this much) in that you throw away information (divisibility, for example) that would allow for constructing better kernels, but often this is still worth it. (Or you could pass this through too.)Something worth exploring later would be getting better support for the rest of CUDA graphs into PyTorch, like conditional nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of a readily available, installable package (pip install pygraph - has no relation to this paper as far as i can tell) makes it difficult to fully assess the reproducibility and practical applicability of the work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see work by IISc show up on HN.Uday Bondhugula, the lead developer of Pluto framework for polyhedral comp. is also at IISc, whose group has spun out a startup,https://www.polymagelabs.com/Nice to see IISc support cool stuff like this (incl. their ArtPark initiative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43786514</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how an individual can be a talented designer without gaining widespread recognition. It emphasizes that success in design does not always correlate with fame or public acknowledgment. The piece highlights the importance of personal fulfillment, continuous growth, and the impact of one's work on specific communities or industries, suggesting that great design can be appreciated in various contexts regardless of its visibility. It encourages designers to focus on their craft and the value they bring, rather than solely seeking fame.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the paradox of the post social media world. I see a lot of mid-tier talent—in all sorts of disciplines/industries—being elevated, while what I personally consider the "greats" get a fraction of the attention (e.g., this designer who I love and have bought stuff from but seems to be a relative unknown [1]).The book "Do the Work" explained it well: "The amateur tweets. The pro works." People who fit into the Shell Silverstein "I'm so good I don't have to brag" bucket aren't as visible because they're working, not talking about working.Something fairly consistent I've observed: the popular people you see tweeting and on every podcast are likely not very good at what they're popular for.Sometimes there's overlap, but it's the exception, not the rule.[1] https://xtian.design/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a designer, I know some absolutely amazing artists who just hunker down and produce phenomenal art/designs and I am not fluffing here. As a climber, I also know of climbers who are at the best in the world level, but don’t post sends on IG or muck about in socially promoting themselves. It’s great to know that there are extremely talented people doing their thing and it’s not driven by leaderboards or social clout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is well written. It also seems to describe society at large, especially our current society. So many things work so well, they become invisible. After time, people dont even realize how much is working behind the scenes to make everything work well and they assume we dont need those things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43787676</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent talk by Scott Aaronson, although it's not something that can be digested as quickly as the typical HN post. The summary slide at the end is perhaps a good introduction to the scope of the topic:* In math, we are finite beings trying to apprehend the infinite* The Busy Beaver function actually quantifies that (!)* Even the finite can exceed the scope of the cosmos. That's where we need physics and complexity theory* Quantum computers look like they're already slightly expanding the scope of what mathematical statements we can know* Can we know even more than that? Depends what the ultimate laws of physics are&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What precisely is meant by simulating the laws of physics? There's a common understanding pitfall there, in that a lot of lay people quickly end up talking about "is the universe a computer" or "infinite Turing machines have nothing to do with the real world" sort of confusing arguments.I liked how this talk addressed the topic yet have questions about this talk's overarching argument. It's kind of an argument yet more like a philosophical position about CS--I know at least one paper that critiques the philosophical commitments made in something like the Church Turing thesis, etc., that paper called Aaronson the strong American style perspective or something, I forget, at any rate the issue is how transparent these philosophical premises are which those of us from computer science may take for granted.I also liked-disliked those one slide proofs. I couldn't follow them, I know they are right (and are great exercises for a student to go over offline) and that they are in service of showing that modern understanding can do the results in one slide and so forth, but yet there's an accepted style of academic presentation that kind of misleadingly  
"performs" in a way that is cognitively impossible for the audience to actually follow unless they already know it, technical talks are kind of a backwards lie in that way. There was a recent popular book by a French mathematician who said as much, that 99.9% of the time we can hardly understand mathematics talks and books and it's kind of an open secret how professionals deal with this phenomenon.Edit: I took undergrad CS theory but never "got" the exposure/fascination with Busy Beaver, but after this talk it became clearer to me that the reason for the Busy Beaver function is that it's a meta-function, it is a function about Turing machines, which is how the BBF gets the special properties/results that it does. Which immediately reminds me of Chaitin's constant which also tries to encode/talk about the properties of Turing machines, e.g. Kolmogorov style complexity which was not explicitly mentioned in the talk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776477</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an elemental diet, which is not new. An elemental diet uses amino acids, fats, sugars, and vitamins to provide the elements of a human diet (hence the name) without whole or partial proteins, fiber, and other things that gut bacteria like to eat. The bacterial overgrowth subsides because you’re not giving it the food it wants. This means you can’t eat anything other than this diet mix for 2 weeks, no exceptions.The only novel part about this branded one is that it’s palatable. That’s actually a big advantage because a plain elemental diet tastes so bad that it’s hard to tolerate.You can search for DIY elemental diet recipes and there are several sources for the amino acid blends they use. People report some success, if they can tolerate the taste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually followed this specific elemental diet for two weeks to treat my hydrogen SIBO, unfortunately without success. I would not recommend this to anybody unless it's absolutely your last chance. I was constantly hungry, cold and lethargic. The shakes taste /terrible/ so I wouldn't really call it palatable. I shiver just thinking about it. I'm sure it works for some people, and I'm happy for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are the ingredients:
https://mbiota.com/cdn/shop/files/OriginalFlavor-Nutrition.p...Study design:Eligible subjects underwent 1 week of screening, 2 weeks of exclusive oral PED, and 2 weeks of follow-up after returning to their regular diet (Supplemental Figure 1). The primary endpoint was the change in stool microbiome after PED and regular food reintroduction. Secondary endpoints included tolerance, LBT normalization rate, stool form changes, symptomatic response, and adverse events. The PED (mBiota Elemental, Good LFE, Santa Monica, USA) was provided in 300-calorie packets, adjusted eucalorically to each participant’s caloric needs (Supplemental Figure 2).Additional packets were provided for hunger, with daily consumption documented. Water intake was unrestricted, but other foods were prohibited during the diet phase. After completing the diet, participants transitioned to bland foods (e.g., rice, potatoes, eggs, chicken, beef) for 2–3 days before resuming their regular diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43778120</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! I use a combination of an endless bash (zsh) history with timestamps that I navigate via fzf and ctr+r and comments I occasionally add to commands via # at the end followed by my annotation so that I can rediscover the command.I do this ever since I switched to a Mac in 2015 and my history has over 60,000 lines. So that’s basically my knowledge base :)But your project looks nice. Will check out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your gif in your README features a prompt asking to "show all files in this directory" but the 'ls -lh' returned and selected in the demo gif does not show all files, just the ones that aren't hidden. I'd have chosen a more accurate interaction for the demo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since it's generating terminal commands dynamically, what safeguards (if any) are in place to avoid generating destructive or insecure commands (like rm -rf /, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43784668</guid></item><item><title>31.

This allows Cursor users to install VS Code extensions from Microsoft's market. Other VS Code forks tend to point to Open VSX, an alternative extension marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look, if you willingly have any piece of your stack relying on Microsoft you have to be ready for the rug pull. They WILL fuck you, it's guaranteed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intellisense from clangd is much better and faster than the Microsoft C++ extension, if you can set up a compile_commands.json. Although debugging still relies on the Microsoft extension. Although I don't think it's going to be hard to create an extension just for debugging (if it does not already exist?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43788125</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I strongly believe pitch competitions are negatively correlated with success because they bias for ideas that are easy to validate which means there’s probably a non-obvious reason it hasn’t been done already.In this case, OP is working on something in the travel space which is notoriously a startup tarpit because customer acquisition costs end up killing most ideas.You can’t meaningfully affect frequency of usage via your actions and the vast majority of the audience travels infrequently enough that they forget your tool exists the next time they travel.Also, if you’re serving outbound, you need to bizdev a meaningful amount of the globe to first gain utility. If you’re serving inbound, the customer acquisition generally only happens late in the user journey and is expensive/time consuming to access.There are still successes in the travel space but the odds are stacked against you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love your enthusiasm so let me share some hard-won learnings with you.In my view, entrepreneurs spend way too little time on the problem space and rather jump into the solution space very quickly (way too quickly).The world is full of problems people accept to live with that they just don't consider important enough to solve.That's the essence of Paul Graham's 'build what people want, not what people need' which is the founder of YC.People will tell you whatever they think you want to hear. When interviewing them you need to understand how they solved the problem before and the actions they took to solve it. Actions speak much louder than words and you can understand how they think about solving the problem which picks up valuable contextual information as well as potential alternative solutions (competing solutions) they evaluated.Once you understand the full context and why they do what they do, you can identify the core problem and related "jobs-to-be-done" which really helps in setting product and marketing strategy as well as positioning towards others.You can do all this with spending very little money to be honest, you may have to put money as an incentive to get enough people to talk to.And then last, if I were you I would find AI use-cases in mid-size companies (20-200 employees). About 80% of early-stage investor money is flowing into AI right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few weeks ago, I participated in a startup competition in Italy. Over a single weekend, my team had to develop a startup idea, validate it, and pitch it against other teams. In this article, I’ll share our experience and the key lessons that led us to victory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:07:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43746109</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experience using a Linux-based phone as a daily driver, exploring the motivations behind this choice and the benefits it offers. It emphasizes the appeal of open-source software, customization options, and privacy compared to mainstream smartphones. The author shares insights on usability, app availability, and performance, as well as the challenges faced during the transition. Ultimately, the piece advocates for the potential of Linux phones in providing a more user-centric and secure mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43779766"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want a Linux phone that could be your daily driver, I would highly recommend the furiphone of furilabs (https://furilabs.com/).I got one from the Fosdem and it is truly amazing! Contrary to previous things I tried, like the pinephone, this one is really totally usable for everyday with everything that you could need (phone, SMS, 4g/5g, ...). Especially, for one time it has a very good camera, on par with some Xiaomi phones, that is really ok when you like to take pictures.Basically, it is a kind of a debian, but there is something very amazing, waydroid, that allows to run Android apps like if it was native apps but with full control other their rights, like being in a sandbox.The only issue that is not really solvable is that a lot of apps are requiring the Google integrity verification shit, so your are forced to connect with your Google account to the play store or Google services to be able to use them. Like these shitty OpenAI and Mistral apps...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But why, indeed.Years ago, I met someone (through another friend) who worked in CS, and was super into digital privacy.  He was the first person I knew to run a Linux phone, for privacy reasons.  He tried to pay for as much as possible by cash, and maintained his accounts manually on paper.  The only way to contact him was by text message (intermittently, unreliably) or via a specific client using the Matrix protocol.  My friend and I both installed the client to be able to contact him and maintain a friendship.After a few months, we both lost contact with him simultaneously: something was updated in the client, and it was impossible to re-establish contact with him without a F2F interaction (="privacy").  Sadly, he was also uncontactable by text message.  For both of us, the friendship simply ceased to exist.My reflection is that such things --as with many things in life-- are on a spectrum.  At some point on the spectrum, as you head towards the extreme end, your position on that spectrum (be it voluntary or --as with disease-- involuntary) start to impair your ability to live (what might be considered) a normal functional life.  I'd also hazard that moving towards that extreme end of the spectrum beings increasing small gains, coupled with increasingly large downsides.I'm not suggesting that running a pure Linux phone is extreme, but it's definitely in the middle zone where there are definite downsides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Many will point out that a Linux phone is less secure than Android or iOS, but that highly depends on your personal threat model. Linux phones and their apps are all open-source and do not depend on ads or surveillance to sustain some nefarious business model, which means there is much privacy to be won.Meanwhile here I am on my Linux machine, constantly anxious that sooner or later one of my bazillion npm and pip dependencies will get compromised, and secretly praying that one day proper sandboxing and an Android-security model will be common on the Linux desktop, so that I can erect security boundaries between my applications and repositories.I find this quote[0] by the developer of SpectrumOS[1] rather telling:    &lt;qyliss&gt; I have embarked on the ultimate yak shave
    &lt;qyliss&gt; it started with "I wish I could securely store passwords on my computer"
    &lt;qyliss&gt; And now I am at the "I have funding to build my own operating system" level

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to enhancing the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating continual learning techniques. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional models, such as catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks negatively impacts the performance on previously learned tasks. The authors propose a framework that effectively balances the learning of new information while preserving existing knowledge, thereby improving model robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments. The study presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and model architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently learned that the IBM Z series mainframes are generally compatible with software written for the legendary IBM 360 launched in 1964. While I'm sure there are caveats, maintaining any backward compatibility with a platform from over 60 years ago is impressive.Having started in 8-bit microcomputers and progressing to various desktop platforms and servers, mainframes were esoteric hulking beasts that were fascinating but remained mysterious to me. In recent years I've started expanding my appreciation of classic mainframes and minis through reading blogs and retro history. This IEEE retrospective on the creation of the IBM 360 was eye-opening. https://spectrum.ieee.org/building-the-system360-mainframe-n...Having read pretty deeply on the evolution of early computers from the ENIAC era through Whirlwind, CDC, early Cray and DEC, I was familiar with the broad strokes but I never fully appreciated how much the IBM 360 was a major step change in both software and hardware architecture. It's also a dramatic story because it's rare for a decades-old company as successful and massive as IBM to take such a huge "bet the company" risk. The sheer size and breadth of the 360 effort as well as its long-term success profoundly impacted the future of computing. It's interesting seeing how architectural concepts from the 360 (as well as DEC's popular PDP-8, 10 and 11) went on to influence the design of early CPUs and microcomputers. The engineers and hobbyists creating early micros had learned computers in the late 60s and early 70s mostly on the 360s and PDPs which were ubiquitous in universities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but really out of sheer curiosity: Who uses mainframes nowadays and what for?I find mainframes fascinating, but I'm so unfamiliar with them that I don't know what or why I'd ever use one for (as opposed to "traditional" hardware or cloud services).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does IBM mainframes still have the pricing model where you 
"buy" hardware and then still pay IBM for main processing?(Where you can save money buying Linux or Java accelerators 
to run things on for free&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43783997</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a project focused on enhancing reading and comprehension skills through translation and context-based features. It showcases an interactive platform where users can read texts in different languages, utilize translation tools, and apply learning strategies to improve language acquisition. The project aims to provide an engaging educational experience by integrating technology with language learning, helping users connect with content more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found that LLMs were much better quality at translation than Google Translate, especially long form text.I created app.698expat.com because I was so frustrated at how bad google translate can be when translating user generated content (like facebook posts) or messages that require additional context.For example, in Vietnamese, you need to know the age of the person relative to the speaker to properly address them. If you translate "Hello", Google translate says "Xin Chao" (which is the proper, but bland translation). A more conversational translation would be "(da) chao (anh|chi|co|con|ong|..)", but in order to know which last word to use, the translator needs more context.example:me: I am speaking to an older woman. how do I say hello to her in vietnamese?gpt: When speaking to an older woman in Vietnamese, a polite and respectful way to say hello is: "Chào cô" – if she’s around your parents’ age (like an aunt).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the video you don't seem to automatically translate everything - thankfully! - but should you plan this in the future, please, please give your users an opt-out or a setting.Just minutes ago I wrestled again with Youtube which doesn't respect my language preferences and tries to autotranslate not just the titles but also dubs videos in a shitty AI-translation, which I don't want. Youtube doesn't really seem to give you settings for this.Machine translation may have gotten better, but it is still not right if you speak both languages. It get's the information across but always feels like the uncanny valley, it doesn't feel right. So my preference still is to never have machine translation between languages I already understand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you using the Google Cloud Translate API or something? AFAIK google translate is a paid API, curious how you're doing it in a free / open source app. BYOK?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43787133</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using vim for 15 years. I disagree with the idea that it makes me more efficient than someone else. First, because I have friends who don't use vim and are very fast. Second because most of my time as a developer is not spent writing/editing text.No, I love vim because of its ergonomics. If I use a mouse for too long, my arm/shoulder starts hurting. Maybe I could improve the ergonomics of my mouse (having a vertical mouse already helped), but using vim and a tiling window manager allow me to drastically reduce my use of the mouse. It makes me more efficient than me when I use a less ergonomic setup, sure. But that's me.It's all about ergonomics, and everyone is different. It's okay to be faster with a mouse or on an iPad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I really appreciate about Vim is that it just opens. And I don't mean speed, I mean not getting bunch of pop-ups nagging me to do something about a configuration, extension, feedback or whatever.I'm not going to claim Vim's defaults are usable for most people, but my god can these IDEs just shut up and let me see my code? I'll go to the settings if I want to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny to see Helix mentioned, without kakoune being mentioned.Helix is a really nifty terminal editor. It aims to be nice out-of-the-box, to have good LSP support, DAP support, and Tree-Sitter support.Compared to vim's "action motion" keybindings, Helix goes for "motion action" (which kakoune popularised). I find this is frequently more intuitive.Helix also has neat discoverability.. with pop-ups showing you what the available keybindings are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43780682</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read the article and while it doesn’t say this nor imply it, this is my takeaway, though correct me if I’m wrong:Model innovation is effectively converging and slowing down considerably. The big companies in this space doing the research are not making leap over leap with each release, and the downstream open source projects are coming closer to the same quality or in fact can produce the same quality (e.g DeepSeek or LLAMA) hence why it’s becoming a commodity.Around the edges model innovation - particularly speed ups in returning accurate results - will help companies differentiate but fundamentally, all this tech is shovels in search of miners, IE you aren’t really going to make money hand over fist by simply being an LLM model provider.In another words, this latest innovation has hit commodity level within a few short years of going mainstream and the winners are going to be the companies that make products on top of this tech, and as the tech continues to become a commodity, the value proposition for pure research companies drops considerably relative to application builders.To me this leaves a central question: when does it hit a relative equilibrium where the technology and the applications on top of it have largely hit their maximal ability to add utility to applicable situations? That’s the next question, and I think the far more important oneOne other thing, at the end of the article they wrote:&gt;Ultimately, businesses won’t rearrange themselves around AI — the AI systems will have to meet businesses where they are.This is demonstrably untrue. CEOs are chomping at the bit to reorganize their business around AI, as in, AI doing things humans used to do and getting the same effective results or better, thereby they can reduce staff across the board while supposedly maintaining the same output or better.Look at the leaked Shopify memo for an example or the trend of “I can vibe code with an LLM making software engineers obsolete” that has taken off as of late, if LinkedIn is to be believed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This take doesn't really highlight the fact that the most competitive foundational model companies are innovative application builders. Anthropic and OpenAI are vying for consumers to use their models by building these sort of super applications (ChatGPT, Claude) that can run code, plot graphs, spin up text editors, create geographic maps, etc. These are well staffed and strategically important areas of their businesses. There's competition to attract consumers to these apps and they will grow more capable and commoditize more compliments along the way. Who needs Jasper when you can edit copy in ChatGPT, or an AI python notebook app, or, now, Cursor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing this article gets wrong is how OpenAI isn’t an application layer company, they built the original ChatGPT “app” with model innovation to power it. They’re good at UX and actually have the strongest shot at owning the most common apps (like codegen).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785919</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; $20 “developer edition” license which “unlocks their API”. I expected this upgrade to give me API access so I could retrieve the image that’s displayed of my device, but that’s not actually the case, and you need a $50 “virtual device” license for that.I cannot find a mention of the developer edition. I own a TRMNL and use the api for free (I assume because I have a device) and then they offer a lifetime $50 license to use their backend with your own device. I think that's fair.Also, I don't quite understand their back ordering information. I ordered mine and got it less than a week later even though they said it was back ordered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TRMNL's site seems to think there is not a cost-savings to build-your-own. They don't appear to include the licensing cost though. From their site:&gt; Making your own TRMNL from scratch is not an economically rational decision, but rather a labor of love. Our own team learned this the hard fun way while building v1 over 7 months, from Dec 2023 to July 2024.&gt; Here's what you can expect to spend per component:&gt; • Battery, $5 (unnecessary if you prefer plugged in)&gt; • EPD screen, $65 (see the Waveshare 7.5" on Amazon)&gt; • Microcontroller, $3-50 (depends if you build/solder yourself or leverage a PCB prototyper)&gt; • Enclosure/case, $3-20 (design + 3D print yourself or use a print farm)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I could have my own TRMNL for under $80, or, if you factor in my time, around $5,000, which is a bargainI love the self awareness.I'm trying to be better about factoring in my time, largely unsuccessfully.E.g. I just spent $200 of my time trying to trade in an iphone at the apple store (the Apple Store sucks now and has terrible processes). Value of trade in: $200&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43781465</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice page! I'm extremely happy about efforts like this. You might argue that the EU is a sprawling, wasteful bureaucracy and you would not be wrong, per se, but they made a lot of useful laws that just simply make the world a better place.Having standardized chargers for phones and laptops is SUPER nice and would never have happened without intervention IMO.The only equivalent for US "useful, average-citizen friendly legislation" that I recently heard about was the standardization of powertool batteries pursued by doge-- which turned out to be an april hoax when I just looked it up :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;availability of operating system upgrades for longer periods (at least 5 years from the date of the end of placement on the market of the last unit of a product model)This is so great! A lot of manufacturers were counting from the date of introduction. A lot of phones only had a 3 year support period. If they are on the market for two years, the people buying last would only get one year of support. This swaps to the last date of sale, which is much more consumer-friendly. I still have to read up on what operating system upgrades entails.rules on disassembly and repair, including obligations for producers to make critical spare parts available within 5-10 working days, and for 7 years after the end of sales of the product model on the EU marketAwesome!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have mixed feeling about this.On one side, it is good to have consumer friendly regulation like manufacturers to be forced to support right to repair. But on the opposite side, lots of bullshit requirements again like the energy labelling, that will do that we have less products, mostly from big actors only, and more expensive due the then useless regulation barrier.And the mixed feeling is stronger for things like manufacturers that needs to provide support for the os for 5 years and more. Sure, I'm happy that it applies to big tech like apple, Google and Samsung, when it is what I'm expecting.
But, I, as a consumer, I would like some times to be able to buy other products, cheaper, crappier (for a burner or test devices for example), and to have small actors being able the try innovation without needing a 500 millions backing to be able to see in Europe.What I would have preferred is a law more oriented on consumer rights than manufacturing regulation:
Forbidding more clearly explicit monopolistic behaviors like what is done with app store; and for right to repair and co, not needing the company to provide support for repair for 5 years but that if they don't, or after 5 years, that they have to release in open source the software, blueprints or tools that are needed to be able to support your own device yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:10:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43781933</guid></item></channel></rss>
