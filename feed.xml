&lt;p&gt;BYD has emerged as the world's largest automaker in terms of research and development workforce, surpassing traditional leaders in the automotive industry. The company boasts over 40,000 employees dedicated to R&amp;D, significantly outpacing competitors such as Toyota and Volkswagen. This expansion reflects BYD's commitment to innovation, particularly in electric vehicles and battery technology, positioning it as a frontrunner in the transition to sustainable transportation. The article highlights BYD's strategic focus on advanced technologies as a key driver of its growing market presence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chinese manufacturers seem to be the only ones willing to make cheap decent EVs. They are scaling like crazy, I hope they keep it up, might turn out to be one of the biggest forces in mitigating emissions. The legacy auto companies who only sell expensive luxury EVs deserve to be crushed by BYD and friends, I have no sympathy left at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Fashion in the automobile industry. I wish we would focus on Cars that last 20+ years again instead.Cars that are repairable, that have common parts across the industry so any mechanic can work on them.Maybe even upgradeable cars so you can make it more environmentally when new technology develops.Will they be the most environmentally friendly to drive? No probably not, but the manufacturing of cars is super environmentally expensive too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes BYD had the most R&amp;D staff, but that's the problem: There are simply too many brands under BYD's umbrella. Every line-up tries to re-invent the wheel with R&amp;D of their own- The vanilla BYD (discontinued, mostly ICE cars)- the E series- Dynasty series- Ocean series- Formula Leopard- Denza- Yangwang- commercial vehicles, batteries, railway transports, OEMs, etc.And many models are overlapping with each other. Jack of all trades, the best selling one is the Seagull from the Ocean series and it costs about $10k&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42556408</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses static search trees, a data structure that allows for efficient searching, inserting, and deleting of data while maintaining a fixed size and structure. It explains the underlying principles of static search trees, compares them with dynamic search trees, and highlights their advantages in scenarios where the data set is known and remains constant. The article includes illustrations and examples to clarify the concepts, making it accessible for readers interested in data structures and algorithm efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562847"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totally off topic, but I've started to notice that more and more algorithmic low-ish level content assumes Rust by default. My entire life I've been used to anything algorithmic being either written in sciency pseudocode (invariably in latex-generated PDFs), or plain old C(++), the vulgar latin of computer programming. I know C and I don't really know Rust but nevertheless I love that this is changing! I'd never advise a new programmer interested in low-level/fast stuff to begin with C now, so much good content is written around Rust. Like the old C examples, the post doesn't even say "this is Rust". You're expected to expect it to be Rust.And, well the language choice doesn't really matter for the core subject here. I could follow this post fine even though I don't really know Rust (just like I assume a Rust programmer could follow a well written algorithms deep dive with examples in C with a bit of dedication). EDIT okok that was a lie, I could follow the first half of this post, ish, and then it got way too deep for me.But anyway, standardize on Rust, I like it. I'd love if a bit more Zig was thrown into the mix here but either of them feel like a better default than C at this point to me. After decades of C being The Standard for this stuff, I love that this is finally changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One dimension that is not explored is partitioning the queries in batches. The primary cost is doing lookups on the out-of-cache table, so if you have a sufficiently large amount of queries you can resolve a couple layers of the tree in one step while those layers are in cache, grouping them based on where they land deeper in the tree, and then resolving all those queries that touch the same deeper part of the tree in one batch as well.In theory, with an infinitely large amount of input queries you will never have to do an out-of-cache lookup, it can be completely amortized away into linear scans.That said, you now end up with a bunch of results that need to be put back into the correct output order, which likely makes it not worth it. But if the operation can be fused into a reduction (e.g. find the sum of the binary search results) or the output order does not matter in some other way then all of a sudden it might make sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazingly thorough ! I love how the author leaves no stone unturned. I had no idea you could do the kind of low level efficiency shaving in Rust.
I wonder how a C++ implementation with https://github.com/jfalcou/eve would compare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562847</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "An Unreasonable Amount of Time" by Allen Pike explores the concept of time in the context of modern work culture, emphasizing how it impacts productivity and creativity. Pike argues that the traditional expectations surrounding time management often lead to burnout and reduced effectiveness. Instead, he advocates for a more flexible approach to time allocation, suggesting that allowing for periods of unstructured time can foster innovation and personal well-being. The piece offers insights on how individuals and organizations can rethink their relationship with time to achieve better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a pleasant surprise and a pleasant read. Its message reminds me of the words of Shunryu Suzuki:&gt; As to progress -- we don’t know how much progress we made, actually, but if you practice it you will realize -- some day you will realize that our progress is not -- it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress. Even though you try very hard, you cannot actually make progress. The progress you make is always little by little. It is like -- to go through fog. You don’t know when you get wet, but if you just walk through fog you will be wet, little by little, even though you don’t know -- it is not like a shower.&gt; When you go out when it is showering you will feel, ‘Oh, that’s terrible!”. It is not so bad but when you get wet by fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. This is how we make progress. So actually there is not need to worry about your progress. Just to do it is the way. It is, maybe, like to study language. Just repeating, you will master it. You cannot do it all of a sudden. This is how we practice, especially Soto way, is to do it little by little. To make progress little by little. Or we do not even mind, we do not expect to make progress, just to do it is our way. The point is to do it with sincerity in each moment. That is the point. There should not be Nirvana besides our practice.Source: https://www.shunryusuzuki.com/detail1?ID=80&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good example (in my twisted mind) is the folks that set up concerts and sports games.I have a friend, who runs setup of major venues. Like, stadiums and conference centers, for big-time events (thousands of people).The deal is, that a whole lot of moving parts, need to come together, for one event, and there can be no screwups[0].Takes a lot of planning, prep work, validation, and, most importantly, experience (my friend is in his sixties), as there are bound to be curveballs, and newbies aren't very good at handling out-of-band events.Not many people can actually do it, but almost everyone thinks they can do it.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOSDrT_eDhk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, useful article. Remember: the same principle holds in the world of the psyche. Those people walking around, seeming effortlessly happy? Unless if they're little children, a horrendous amount of effort has been invested to their inner peace. It took me years to realize that. Being envious is much easier than being humble and diligent with getting one's shit together.My wish for 2025 is for massive, decentralized, slow yet steady psychological magic. HNY, HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557098</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive CAPTCHA solution that uses a game-like interface inspired by the classic Doom video game. Users must navigate through a simple shooting mechanics game to complete the CAPTCHA, making the process engaging while effectively verifying that users are human. The design combines retro aesthetics with modern functionality, enhancing the typical CAPTCHA experience by offering a playful alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach involving the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for improving the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. The authors present a framework that integrates GANs with traditional training methods to enhance the model's ability to withstand input perturbations. They provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of their method on various datasets, showing improved performance and reduced vulnerability to adversarial examples compared to existing techniques. The study emphasizes the potential of GANs in creating more resilient machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when this stuff was all coming out and people were finally excited about ChatGPT getting the problem with "which is heavier, a 10 pound bag of feathers or a 10 pound bag of bricks?" problem correct. But of course it got it correct. It was in the training set. Vary the problem slightly by just changing the nouns, or changing the numbers so that one in fact was heavier than the other, and performance went all over the map.I just went to chatgpt.com and put into the chat box "Which is heavier, a 9.99-pound back of steel ingots or a 10.01 bag of fluffy cotton?", and the very first answer I got (that is, I didn't go fishing here) was    The 9.99-pound bag of steel ingots is heavier than the 10.01-pound
    bag of fluffy cotton by a small margin. Although the cotton may
    appear larger due to its fluffy nature, the steel ingots are denser
    and the weight of the steel bag is 9.99 pounds compared to the 10.01
    pounds of cotton. So, the fluffy cotton weighs just a tiny bit more
    than the steel ingots.

Which, despite getting it both right and wrong, must still be graded as a "fail".If you want to analyze these thing for their true capability, you need to make sure you're out of the training set... and most of the things that leap to your mind in 5 seconds are leaping to your mind precisely because they are either something you've seen quite often or something that you can easily think of and therefore many other people have easily thought of them as well. Get off the beaten path a bit and the math gets much less impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One experiment I would love to see, although not really feasible in practice, is to train a model on all digitized data from before the year 1905 (journals, letters, books, broadcasts, lectures, the works), and then ask it for a formula for mass-energy equivalence. A certain answer would definitely settle the debate on whether pattern recognition is a form of intelligence ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance of these LLMs on real life tasks feels very much like students last-minute cramming for Asian style exams.The ability to perfectly regurgitate, while no concept of meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565606</guid></item><item><title>6.

Ten years ago now, so hopefully not needed anymore, but was a fun project:
https://github.com/Matsemann/mDjiControllerThose first generation consumer drones were so wack. Hard to fly, and very brittle software. I lost it when it randomly decided to "fly home" when I took off from a new location without storing a new gps location.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, the reasons why Redis commands API suck in Andy's video (linked in the post) are the weakest ever. It is possible to make a case against the Redis API (I would not agree of course but... it's totally legitimate), but you gotta have stronger arguments than those, particularly if you are a teacher of some kind. Especially: you need to be somewhat fluent in Redis and how developers use Redis in order to understand why so many people like it, and then elaborate what it's wrong about it (if you believe there is something wrong). The video shows a general feeling of "I don't really use / know this, but I don't like how NON-SQL it is".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions Greenplum, but it's worth noting that when the code was closed, several of the original developers created an open-source fork, Cloudberry, which seems to be thriving. Cloudberry was accepted into the Apache project this year, and has synced with Postgres 14, whereas the closed-source Greenplum is still stuck on Postgres 12.The architecture is quite ancient at this point, but I'm not sure it's completely outdated. It's single-master shared-nothing, with shards distributed among replicas, similar to Citus. But the GPORCA query planner is probably the most advanced distributed query planner in the open source world at this point. From what I know, Greenplum/Cloudberry can be significantly faster than Citus thanks to the planner being smarter about splitting the work across shards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This take screams more than a technical criticism but of something personal. 
“I'll be blunt: I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow. Our experiments at CMU found Dragonfly to have much more impressive performance numbers (even with a single CPU core). In my database course, I use the Redis query language as an example of what not to do.” (From the article)Of course it’s not to be used as a general purpose DB it’s keys and values.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My best books of 2024:* Chemistry: A Very Short Introduction by Peter Atkins. Now that I'm into physics I had a hunch that I would now also appreciate chemistry. This book delivered.* Philosophy of Mind: A Very Short Introduction by Barbara Gail Montero. I recall it just being a really well-written overview of an interesting field.* Systemantics by John Gall. Very entertaining musings on why systems fail.* Hard-Boiled Wonderland by Haruki Murakami. Read this while in Japan. A very strange and interesting noir detective story.* All Systems Red by Martha Wells. &lt;3 Murderbot &lt;3* Desert Oracle Volume 1 by Ken Layne. American southwest folklore. Read it while in Joshua Tree.* There Is No Antimemetics Division by qntm. Biggest brainfuck I've read in a long time, probably ever.* Fundamentals: Ten Keys To Reality by Frank Wilczek. Physics musings from a Nobel winner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I was also going through a phase in my life where I believed reading more fiction would help power up my imagination.I kind of hate this mindset.  Why does reading always have to be with the goal of self improvement?  When someone binge watches a new TV series on Netflix no one asks them what skill they were trying to sharpen by enjoying that media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Ask HN: What is the best thing you read in 2024?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42508087Ask HN: Best non-fiction book you read in 2024?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42218828&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564687</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The content discusses the concept of "zero," exploring its historical significance, mathematical foundations, and philosophical implications. It highlights how zero functions as both a number and a placeholder in the decimal system, facilitating mathematical operations and representing the absence of quantity. The article also touches upon zero's role in advanced mathematical concepts and its impact on various fields beyond mathematics, emphasizing its crucial importance in modern science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilarious irony:&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an "epsilon loss" in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2005, my paper on breaking RSA by observing a single private-key operation from a different hyperthread sharing the same L1 cache -- literally the first publication of a cryptographic attack exploiting shared caches -- was rejected from the cryptology preprint archive on the grounds that "it was about CPU architecture, not cryptography".  Rejection from journals is like rejection from VCs -- it happens all the time and often not for any good reason.(That paper has now been cited 971 times according to Google Scholar, despite never appearing in a journal.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was confused by the title because paper rejection is incredibly common in research, but that's the point and one of the goals is to fight imposter syndrome.It's a good initiative. Next step: everybody realizes that researchers are just random people like everybody. Maybe that could kill any remaining imposter syndrome.A rejection, although common, is quite tough during your PhD though, even ignoring the imposter syndrome, because in a short time, you are expected to have a bunch of accepted papers, in prestigious publications if possible. It feels like a rejection slows you down, and the clock is still ticking. If we could kill some of this nefarious system, that'd be good as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42568399</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just cross posting my lobsters post:I want to say thanks to @dgl for reporting this, and this article is also expertly written.I also have to say for me personally its quite embarrassing because as I told @dgl when he reported this: I’ve studied his work before and made it a note to test Ghostty against his past discoveries prior to release. And I… quite simply forgot. I didn’t make an issue for myself so it slipped away and here I am with egg on my face. I’m sorry!But, I appreciate @dgl for the security report, reviewing the fix, and continuing to be an active user of the terminal. I also shared with him some broader thoughts on terminal security in general. Addressing terminal security in a more fundamental way is one of the first proposals I want to make regarding terminal innovation.My thinking is still too early and under-researched for a formal proposal. But my general feeling having built a terminal over the past 2 years is that the security surrounding escape sequences is fundamentally flawed and poking one by one at these sequences to try to make them individually safe doesn’t feel like the right long term solution.The surface area is too large and the complexity of some of the newer sequences too high (i.e. Kitty Graphics) to be confident in secure implementations. DoS is far too easy with terminals (Ghostty has a handful of known DoS attacks, but so does pretty much every other terminal I know of). And some legacy sequences are just kind of shocking to have immediately available. For example, DECCOLM is available in macOS Terminal.app. If you issue a DECCOLM (CSI ? 3 h I believe), Terminal.app will physically resize the window and lock it to 132 columns. You can very easily crash Terminal.app at anytime by sending enough of these (a DoS attack). There are many more.Part of my thinking is trying to design a mechanism that can effectively create something akin to either CPU protection rings or OpenBSD’s pledge() syscall. Whatever the mechanism, the general idea is: reduction of capability.For example, it makes sense for a shell to be extremely powerful. It’s literally a code execution device. However, it doesn’t make much sense for cat to be able to execute arbitrary escape sequences (which it does today in any terminal). Whether it is the shell or cat itself, something should be able to tell a terminal: “hey, only execute some subset of escape sequences (or none at all).” For cat, that might be none or perhaps just SGR sequences (styles, colors, etc.). The insecurity of cat-ing or tail-ing any form of data that could contain user-generated data is hopefully well known at this point…As I said before, this thinking is all still very raw and I don’t have anything concrete to proposal. I want to share this because I want folks to know that I’m thinking about it, and perhaps others may be interested in thinking about it with me… if so, please contact me. I’ve already shared this line of thinking with @dgl as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish that 1% of the sustained effort that is currently being devoted to building terminal emulators and TUI applications was collectively redirected at researching a better future to fill this niche.Terminal emulators and TUI applications belong with the DMG Gameboys, Commodore 64's, and DOSBoxes: as a historical curiosity and something for the enthusiasts to enjoy after hours. But we've come to rely on them almost to the point where they're being fetishised; most of us using this technology nowadays aren't even questioning its negative impact.We need better command line / REPL environments. We need better cross-platform GUI toolkits. We need better remote access. And we need to let go of the TV teletype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m impressed with how many bugs (security and otherwise) have been fixed and new features included [0] in the 1.0.1 release, considering the first public release (1.0) was only 5 days ago.[0]: https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-0-1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42562743</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This maps a little to what we are doing research on what we are calling as shape of stories[1].We can clearly see in 2D space itself how different "concepts" are explored.Using the shape of stories for semantic chunking we can clearly see in multiple articles how we can chunk by "concepts". [2]Now we are trying to see if we can just use these chunks and train a next "chunk" predictor instead of a next word predictor.In the paper, they take a sentence to mean a concept. We believe that a "semantic chunk" is better suited for a concept instead of a sentence.[1] https://gpt3experiments.substack.com/p/the-shape-of-stories-...[2]https://gpt3experiments.substack.com/p/a-new-chunking-approa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like a failure to learn the bitter lesson: You're just taking the translation to concepts that the LLM is certainly already doing and trying to make it explicitly forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What used to be feature engineering a decade or more ago now seems to have shifted to developing distributed representations. LLMs use word tokens (for words or the entities in images). But there are many more. The 3D Fields (or whatever they have evolved to) developed by Fei-Fei Li's group represent visual information in a way better suited for geometrical tasks. Wav2Vec, the convolutional features for YOLO and friends, and these sentence representations are other examples. I would love to read a review of this circle of ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42563534</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Software Design is Knowledge Building" discusses the importance of software design as a means to foster knowledge creation within teams and organizations. It emphasizes that effective software design goes beyond coding and technical skills, highlighting the need for collaboration, shared understanding, and continuous learning among developers. The author advocates for iterative design processes and the value of documenting and reflecting on design decisions as a way to enhance collective expertise. Ultimately, the piece underscores that good software design contributes to team cohesion and the overall success of projects by facilitating deeper insights into both the technology and domain it serves.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've handed off a few services I built with minimal oversight or documentation. The receiving teams have been able to make changes without my involvement and everyone is happy.I believe the only reason I've been successful in this is because I agonize over simplicity. There are times during the development of any project where one might be tempted to hack around an issue, or commit the ugly code that seems to work. These are the rough edges that inheritors of a codebase use as evidence that a blank slate would be preferable. They're also the bits where the underlying business logic becomes murky. My goal is for the code to be so clear that documentation would feel redundant.This approach of course takes more time and requires that your management trusts you and is willing to compromise on timelines. It's extremely rewarding if you can sell it and deliver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a well-referenced essay, drawing the on writing of David Parnas [1], Peter Naur [2], and Zach Tellman [3].As software developers we’re intimately familiar with these ideas. But the industry still treats it as “folk knowledge”, despite decades of academic work and systemization attempts like the original Agile.We really need more connective work, relating the theoretical ideas to the observed behavior of real-life software projects, and to the subsequent damage and dysfunction. I liked this essay because it scratches that itch for me. But we need this work to go beyond personal blogs/newsletters/dev.to articles. It needs to be recognized &amp; accepted as formal “scientific” knowledge, and to be seen and grokked by industry and corporate leadership.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/257734.257788[2] https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf[3] https://explaining.software/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of our white collar jobs are about knowledge sharing and synchronization between people.And surprisingly this is an aspect in which I see very very little progress.The most we have are tools like confluence or Jira that are actually quite bad in my opinion.The bad part is how knowledge is shared. At the moment is just formatted text with a questionable search.LLMs I believe can help in synthesize what knowledge is there and what is missing.Moreover it would be possible to ask what is missing or what could be improved. And it would be possible to continuously test the knowledge base, asking the model question about the topic and checking the answer.I am working on a prototype and it is looking great. If someone is interested, please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557255</guid></item><item><title>14.

There are subsets of the overall problem that can be solved by a gpu (eg object detection) but the whole planning and control algo scheme seems to be more or less the same as it has been for the past decades.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pleasantly surprised to see this improvement:  Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) removes the created temporary file
  immediately. So applications don’t need to remove the file.
  [Feature #20497]

I use a similar pattern a lot:  file = Tempfile.new.tap(&amp;:unlink)
  file &lt;&lt; "... some really large data to pipe"
  system("md5sum", in: file.tap(&amp;:rewind))

It's a neat trick to leverage the filesystem for large amounts of data (e.g. "psql \copy" generation), without littering tempfiles everywhere. Once the last fd disappears, the filesystem releases the data; so you don't have to "trap" signals and add cleanup routines. (Hint: you can also use these unlinked-tempfiles for command output, e.g. huge grep output, etc.)On Linux systems, `open(..., O_TMPFILE)` is typically used, which provides additional safety. The created file is initially unnamed (no race condition between `open` and `unlink`).When I needed safety, my non-portable solution was to use Ruby's syscall feature. (Btw, I love that you can do this.)  require "fcntl"

  SYS_OPEN   = 2
  O_TMPFILE  = 0x00410000
  O_RDWR     = Fcntl::O_RDWR

  def tmpfile
    mode = O_RDWR | O_TMPFILE
    fd = syscall(SYS_OPEN, "/dev/shm", mode, 0644)
    IO.for_fd(fd)
  end

But... Another pleasant surprise from the PR (https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20497).  Linux 3.11 has O_TMPFILE to create an unnamed file.
  The current implementation uses it.

Excellent to see :)
Makes the PR even better!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know Shopify has a great site on comparing Ruby vs YJIT perf.https://speed.yjit.orgBut does anyone have current numbers on how Ruby/YJIT compares to something like Python/PHP/LuaJIT?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The default block parameter name seems small, but I feel like I'm gonna use it all the time, especially when I'm in the Rails console just trying to debug data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42566141</guid></item><item><title>16.

Space is hard, rocketry is harder and I wish them luck, but Blue Origin has an awfully long way to go if they want to catch up to SpaceX: this was meant to be the Falcon 9 killer, but odds are Starship will be fully operational before New Glenn completes testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue Origin is a funny company.  I worked for TerraBella/SkySat/Google Satellite, Planet Labs and Kubos, each as a consultant/contractor/whatever.  I struck up a conversation w/ Rob Meyerson @ a conference and told him what I was working on (mostly comms / ground station work, but with a tiny bit of GNC test infrastructure.)  I mean, I'm not God's gift to rocket scientists, but...  I was pretty heavily recruited by them but was working at Amazon and didn't want to leave, then spent some time nursing a family member through cancer treatments.  Finally I'm ready to talk to them and I start with back-channel chats to make sure they still have open reqs.  They do so I informally talk about specific things I've done and what I might do at BO.  Finally I put my resume together and submit it to the hiring manager I had been talking about, emphasizing the bits he said he was interested in.  15 minutes later I'm rejected for the position they had been recruiting me for.I mean... I'm not a SUPER rocket engineer, but I'm pretty solid for the things I did work on.  I've slogged through design meetings where I had to analyze protocol specs and make sure we agree'd on details, wrote code, wrote A LOT of tests.  I mean, I'm solid.  The only thing I can think is I don't have a Ph.D., but that DEFINITELY wasn't a requirement when Bob was running the shop.Folk have told me it's evolved into something much more like Amazon where each team optimizes it's tiny bit and teams communicate only via APIs and the only opportunity you get to optimize complete functional or value chains is when something breaks.Just seems a bit weird they went from "we're 10 guys in a hangar" to "we've re-implemented Amazon's small-team/local optimization religion" in less than 10 years and with less than 1/30-th of the number of engineers.I wish them the best.  I think SpaceX really needs some decent competition to focus their collective minds.  But... they've gone weird.I'm probably too senior and too "weird" to them to get hired there, but I absolutely encourage young engineers interested in an intense experience to check out their jobs page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534555</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A DSL for XState[0] by the co-creator of astro.build[1], cool! But the repo[2] has been archived and there is an active FSM library from the same developer called robot[3].[0]: https://xstate.js.org/[1]: https://astro.build/[2]: https://github.com/lucydsl/liblucy[3]: https://github.com/matthewp/robot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I don't like about these state machine DSLs is that they are not really composable at the "machine level". It is a known fact that FSM are equivalent to regular expressions [1]    Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognised by a finite automaton. The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as Kleene's theorem

I think a cool state machine language would use this fact as a starting point for it's syntax. Another very useful feature would be "functions" to isolate specific repetitive parts of FSM[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quite like the concise state machine definitions used in Rodney Brooks' "A Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot"[0]. The first element is the state name, and whatever is returned is the next state.  (defmodule avoid
    :inputs (force heading)
    :outputs (command)
    :instance-vars (resultforce)
    :states ((nil (event-dispatch (and force heading) plan))
             (plan (setf resultforce (select-direction force heading))

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with all the very impressive videos on that page is that we have no idea how many attempts were made before the robot could successfully, e.g. "put strawberry into the correct bowl". In that task there's four bowls, so a random choice of bowl would be correct 25% of the time. How many times did the robot put the strawberry e.g. in the bowl of apples? And that's assuming "the correct bowl" is the one with the strawberries (which is a big assumption- the strawberry should go with the others of its kind: says who? How often can the robot put the strawberry in the bowl with the apples if that's what we want it to do?).Plotted results show around 50% average performance on "unseen" tasks, environments, objects etc, which sounds a lot like success follows some kind of random distribution. That's not a great way to engender trust in the "emergent" abilities of a robotic system to generalise to unseen tasks etc. Blame bad statistics if you get a strawberry in the eye, or a banana in the ear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[2023]Some of the authors have gone on to found a startup called Physical Intelligence: https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We represent the robot actions as text strings as shown below. An example of such a string could be a sequence of robot action token numbers: “1 128 91 241 5 101 127 217”.Training with numbers like this might be a little problematic, I have tried to fine tune GPT 4o-mini with very little success(just me?)On the other hand I found[1] Gemini and Molmo being able to locate elements on screen much better than 4o.1. https://github.com/BandarLabs/clickclickclick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565638</guid></item><item><title>21.

Earlier today I had noticed that Kythe ripped out its support for indexing Rust code and wondered what alternatives might exist. So iinteresting to see this right now!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While playing solitaire to while away the time during rest, Ulam asked himself a straightforward question: what are the chances that a hand laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? It is a deceptively challenging problem—there are around 8 × 10^67 ways to sort a deck of cards (a number approaching the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe). He wondered if instead of applying pure combinatorial calculations, which would be monstrously difficult, he could simply lay out the cards one hundred times and count the number of successful plays. Implicit was the assumption that each play started with randomized conditions.Indeed, the best “results”, to this day, are still approximations based on brute-forcing a huge number of deals (aka, using Monte-Carlo.)“The probability of being able to win a game of Klondike [Solitaire] with best-possible play is not known, and the inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as "one of the embarrassments of applied probability"” — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)#Probabili...“Here we show that a single general purpose Artificial Intelligence program, called “Solvitaire”, can be used to determine the winnability percentage of 45 different single-player card games with a 95% confidence interval of ± 0.1% or better. For example, we report the winnability of Klondike as 81.956% ± 0.096%” — https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12314v3 (2019)More on HN here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42372083&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always completely forget that the metropolis-hastings algorithm is named after someone whose last name is actually Metropolis.It never ceases to amaze me what an environment Los Alamos was for producing so much foundational research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently going through the Statistical Rethinking [0] class on Bayesian statistics, and it reminded me that Bayesian statistics' renaissance was basically thanks to Monte Carlo methods. Such methods can approximate posterior distributions that are often extremely difficult to calculate analytically.[0] https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564735</guid></item><item><title>24.

It sets a norm for countries ratifying the treaty to have a domestic copyright exception covering these activities and allowing for the import and export of such materials.It's been in force since 2016, the US joined over five years.  I can't comment on the overall success, but seems like a rare gem, being a copyright law/treaty, international or otherwise, that is unabashedly good!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an aspect of something which I wish would be more acknowledged and investigated:&gt;How can the electronic representation of books be made more rich and featureful?Some notable examples:- https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.htm...- https://www.motionmountain.net/- The Elements by Theodore Gray https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-by-theodore-gray/...- the "Living Books" series: https://wanderfulstorybooks.com/Unfortunately vanished (anyone have an archive? was the wonderful _Bembo's Zoo_ https://www.devicq.com/bembo-zoo/ and https://engagetheirminds.com/2012/04/05/bembos-zoo/I'd be very glad of other examples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice.I note that in some ways the pictures really contribute to the story.  For example, see the story on Eeyore's tail missing.  The clue is that the picture shows the tail hanging as a cord to ring the doorbell.   The alt text conveys this nicely by saying:In this drawing, Pooh is back outside Owl's front door, with Owl standing in the doorway. Pooh is looking at the bell-rope, which ends in a tuft of hair.I'm not sure if this could truly be automated, as the description of the picture needs to fit the context of the story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565513</guid></item><item><title>25.

But experts aided by Ithaca’s suggestions had the best results of all, filling gaps with an accuracy of 72%. Ithaca also identified the geographical origins of inscriptions with 71% accuracy, and dated them to within 30 years of accepted estimates."and"[Using] an RNN to restore missing text from a series of 1,100 Mycenaean tablets ... written in a script called Linear B in the second millennium bc. In tests with artificially produced gaps, the model’s top ten predictions included the correct answer 72% of the time, and in real-world cases it often matched the suggestions of human specialists."Obviously 62%, 72%, 72% in ten tries, etc. is not sufficient by itself. How do scholars use these tools? Without some external source to verify the truth, you can't know if the software output is accurate. And if you have some reliable external source, you don't need the software.Obviously, they've thought of that, and it's worth experimenting with these powerful tools. But I wonder how they've solved that problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The full title is "How AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history", and that second part is especially fitting, although unfortunately not mentioned in the article itself, which is full of rather horrifying stories about using AI to "fill in" missing data, which is clearly not true data recovery in any meaningful sense.I am aware of how advanced algorithms such as those used for flash memory today can "recover" data from imperfect probability distributions naturally created by NAND flash operation, but there seems to a huge gap between those, which are based on well-understood information-theoretic principles, and the AI techniques described here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find this incredibly exciting. There could be some truly remarkable works whose contents are about to be revealed, and we don’t really know what we might find. Histories of the ancient (more ancient) world. Accounts of contact with cultures and civilizations that are currently lost to history. Scientific and mathematical discoveries. And what I often find to be the most moving: stories of daily life that illuminate what regular people thought and felt and experienced thousands of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549123</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the UK, the financial year ends on 5 April. This is Lady Day (25 March) plus the 11 days lost in the transition from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Exodus 12:1-2, at the beginning of the section that decrees Passover, God also tells Moses and Aaron that the month of Passover is the first month of the year:  The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, "This month is
  to be for you the first month, the first month of your
  year. ..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A decent case can be made for March 1 as the start of the year. With March 1 as the start of the year the extra day in leap years then comes on the last day of the year. This makes dealing with leap years when calculating the day of the week from a date simpler.It also makes the names of September, October, November, and December make sense. Those names come from the Roman words for 7, 8, 9, and 10, which were the numbers of those months in the old Roman calendar which did start the year on March 1. The Romans switch the start to January sometime around 700 BCE giving us the current ridiculous situation where those months are two months later in the year than their names suggest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42568805</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do a switcharoo, I develop for iOS inside a macOS VM with Linux host.After a 5 years hiatus I started developing mobile apps again and I was frustrated to learn that Apple doesn't allow renewing the developer license on web anymore, I don't own a Mac  and even Apple developer app on iPhone didn't allow me to renew my license.After I signed into a macOS VM, I was able to renew my license through Apple Developer App on iPhone as macOS version of the app requires T2 chip.Now I have PTSD flashbacks of why I left mobile development in first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use pbcopy/pbpaste in a Linux VM on Mac by making a shell script wrapper in the VM that calls “ssh mac-host pb{copy|paste}” - that is, basically ssh back from the guest to the host to use its clipboard. It’s seamless and fast since it’s basically a local network connection.My specific setup is that I use an authorized_keys entry on the host that restricts the guest to running a specific command, which limits what a compromised guest can do to the host. The command is set to a script that has a list of specific permitted actions. This is a good option if you’re looking for a bit of additional isolation between host and guest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run my entire work computer inside of a VM. I work from home and have a powerfull desktop i use for my private stuff hooked up to my 3 monitors. My work pc is a vmware vm running inside of vmware pro. I can minimize the work vm and work it out my sight or I can selective choose that the vm should use 1, 2 or 3 monitors and it is easy to switch back and forth between work and private without have any work related data on my private desktop. The work vm is domain joined, o365 enterprise joined and loocked down in ridicilous ways by cooperate IT but now i can run that from my private powerfull PC without worring that corp IT messes up my private computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42541508</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a second as a unit of time measurement, explaining its historical evolution from ancient methods based on celestial observations to its current definition based on atomic time. It details how the second is defined in terms of the vibrations of cesium atoms, highlighting the precision and scientific advancements that led to this standardization. The piece also addresses the implications of this definition for both practical purposes and philosophical inquiries about the nature of time itself.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question asked, question answered...What is a second? (johndcook.com)An Unreasonable Amount of Time (allenpike.com)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A funny consequence of this is that there are people alive today that do not know (and never will know) their exact age in seconds[1].This is true even if we assume the time on the birth certificate was a time precise down to the second. It is because what was considered the length of a second during part of their life varied significantly compared to what we (usually) consider a second now.[1] Second as defined in the article as 9192631770/s being the the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Incidentally, “cesium” is the American English spelling of the name of atomic element 55, and “caesium” is the IUPAC spelling.I'm so glad we settled on common notations (drived from Brahmi script) to represent numbers. On one end, we humans chase precision with math. On the other end we humans can't even agree on spellings in the same language spoken in different continents. I wonder if spelling differences has resulted in any critical failures such as the metrics conversion error in NASA Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999

HDPARM is capable of issuing the command if the SSD/HDD supports it and HDPARM is the tool they seem to be using. Not sure what they are using for NVME though as they use PCIE…not SATA commands.
Maybe sedutil from OPAL?
Anywho, tor most drives whether SSD, HDD or NVME you can ‘erase’ it by simply setting and deleting my the KEK and UEK but to securely erase you want to do security enhanced erase data command that runs locally in the drive and is independent of the OS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the nwipe (what this uses) page:&gt;In the current form nwipe does not sanitize solid state drives (hereinafter referred to as SSDs) of any form (SAS / Sata / NVME) and / or form factor (2.5" / 3.5" / PCI) fully due to their nature: ...https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipeThe ShredOS page suggests the use of hdparm for SSDs but things are fairly complicated:* https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/blob/master/ssd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software erasure is no good on modern hardware, it pulls too many tricks internally and the data could easily stick around in a region of NAND not accessible.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the limitations and insights offered by statistics in understanding human behavior and societal trends. It discusses how statistical data can provide a framework for interpreting complex phenomena but also emphasizes that numbers can be misleading or misinterpreted. By examining real-world examples, the author illustrates the importance of context, the potential pitfalls of reductionism, and the need for a nuanced approach to data analysis. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a balanced view of statistics as both a powerful tool and a construct that requires careful application to truly reflect human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

But doesn't this come up in all kinds of daily situations, graphical or otherwise? You only recalculate and update the parts that may have changed. I assume this is similar to why Zelda on my original black and gray GameBoy as a 90s kid was arranged into scenes with few moving elements, so it didn't have to recalculate rendering for the entire screen during action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never wrote code for the hp48-gx, but I remember that some games written in assembly looked like Game Boy games. The screen even had shades of gray by writing once every 4, 8, ... loop. I don't have the details but it was pretty convincing. Some source code would help in that case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flashback to lurking around comp.sys.hp48 looking for downloads.https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.hp48/c/BS7c8hRAau0/m/P5...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557019</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once made a large pencil drawing of my living room using only words.Each word depicted a "thing" at the position I found it.  It taught me a lot about what things are.  A chair is obviously a separate entity and easy to list, but what about the floor and the separate floorboards?  I listed the wall, but I didn't list the paint on the wall.The bookcase took a lot of effort, because I found that each book in it was a thing by itself and should get listed separately.  However, when I was nearly finished, I found a bag in a cabinet, holding ~200 pins.  I just counted them and noted down "207 pins"; I didn't feel that each pin was unique enough to warrant separate entries.I now try to stop believing in things.  It's mostly just molecules that happen to be in a certain configuration for some time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some constructive feedback to the site owner: Instead of having the webpage spend several minutes slowly loading thousands of barely-compressed 500x500 JPG images, please consider this advice:1. Convert the images to WEBP or AVIF or at least run them through something like TinyPNG to compress them better.2. Save two versions of each images; a 75x75 version that gets used for the 75px thumbnails shown on the page, and a 500x500 version that appears in the lightbox after a thumbnail is clicked.3. Only load a few dozen thumbnails at first and then load more after the user scrolls down or clicks a "show more" type button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oof, just loading this page caused my browser to download 170 MB of content.

Very few use libraries, and forget temperature/humidity control: most feel no shame in mishandling books they borrow. The availability and care shown to books, new and old, in the US is very commendable.Our prime minister and most citizens love to brag about "ancient culture" and "proud history", but preservation of our own history and public record was and is done much better by the British and Americans. It's truly nauseating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always argued that antiquated books, sculptures and paintings should not be repatriated back to India due to lack of preservation ecosystem and culture. Just look at the historic sites (barring a very few popular ones), they are either literally pissed on upon or become a poster board for election campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Books are printed in quantities of more than one. I concede a fair amount of material might be the last copy extant, but isn't there an element of post-hoc rationalisation this impoverished stocks of Indian books?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548390</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant disruptions experienced on the Elizabeth Line during a two-day breakdown, detailing the causes and impacts of the signaling failures that led to service cancellations and delays. It explores the technical issues faced by Transport for London, the response to the chaos, and how this incident reflects on the management of the new railway line. The breakdown affected many passengers and raised concerns about the reliability of the service shortly after its launch, highlighting the complexities of modern rail signaling systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's very little information in either this post or elsewhere on the internets.This discussion on a UK rail forum provides some food for thought [1]The Elizabeth line is pioneering in terms of aiming for automated train operation (ATO) over infrastructure that's shared to some extent with trains driven by humans. Going beyond driving per se, both types of trains make use of highly complex automation for functions like switch management, traffic separation for safety and station door opening.Reading through the lines, two systemic difficulties this brings about are:(A) A conceptually new ATO system (Siemens Trainguard MT); a further plot twist is that Siemens acquired the system mid-development from Invensys.(B) Ad-hoc integration of this system with a large number of external systems provided by several vendors; it should be of note that rail systems are not designed for to interoperability with other vendors, and integration is often achieved post-development bringing about otherwise avoidable complexity.Given that during the incident each individual domain of the system (A) has been reset and validated multiple times, my suspicion falls on the undocumented and uncharted complexity underlying (B).[1] https://www.railforums.co.uk/threads/elizabeth-line-total-lo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incidentally GSM-R problems led to a nationwide train service shutdown in Norway on December 25.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "The Psychonaut Field Manual" serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals exploring altered states of consciousness through various means, including psychedelics and meditation. It covers topics such as preparation for journeys, safety protocols, the nature of consciousness, and techniques for navigating experiences. The manual emphasizes the importance of personal growth and understanding oneself through these explorations, while also providing practical advice on integrating experiences afterward. It aims to equip readers with the knowledge and tools necessary for safe and insightful psychonautic practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think when people read things like this they overly focus on the hocus pocus part of it rather than something that is probably or even definitely true with human beings - that there is a certain power to belief. I’ve had treatment resistant PTSD and depression most of my life and inevitably stuff like meditation/spirituality comes up, which I had always felt was a desperate last resort, and although I am agnostic, I am extremely materialist and find much of it dumb/silly. I started however reading textbooks about tantric yoga and their claims, while some of it is indeed weird or silly, there is definitely something to some of it - particularly tibetan yoga practitioners being able to withstand extreme heat, cold, or endurance for long periods of time with no seeming explanation. I had discovered my ability a long time ago to control pain levels and my perception of hot/cold, but they seem to be doing something that is actually controlling internal body functions, and that got my imagination going about how one could use that to treat things like PTSD.I have had some success. a lot of it is visualizing and “believing” any way you possibly can, I think much of the ritual in stuff like this is to get you into whatever state is needed to trick your body or mind into doing something, at least that’s how I think it “works.” The author seems kind of aware of this and it seems to borrow many similar concepts as the stuff I’ve read, but with much more occultish ritual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just read the whole 44 pages and some years ago I spent a day or two delving into Crowley’s work. (I was curious but never had the time or need to practice any of the teachings)There’s a spooky coherence in the descriptions and that’s what makes it such a fascinating read. The spin that this work puts on the subject - calling this “technology” and likening it to programming adds to this.To anyone honestly wanting to take this for a spin, I recommend reading the biography of Aleister Crowley first. It’s an interesting read in itself and it also illustrates the risks/dangers. Pictures speak a thousand words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The classic, train your mind to believe anything you want, use it to improve your life, try believing some really cooky stuff, woah you actually believe it, no shit, you descend into crazier and crazier stuff.I’m currently leaning towards believing that learning intense focus through meditation + setting intentions for yourself in that state is genuinely useful, just like rituals are (saying “yes” to your partner in front of friends and family it changes you). But the border between it and “I’m a trans dimensional shaman in psychiatric A&amp;E” is a bit to thin for my liking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42563946</guid></item><item><title>40.

So randomize the location of the chess board at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's fun! Is it possible to have an optional pause before solution is shown, so if looking at the screen there is some time to try to solve the puzzle?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it actively solve chess puzzles or replay saved puzzle solutions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564144</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some things to notice about this paper:1.  It contains no references.2.  It is not actually about the long and painful history of time.  In fact, it barely touches on history at all.3.  Some of the things it says are flat-out wrong.  For example, "How long does it take the earth to face the Sun at the same angle? This simple question has a definite and fairly simple scientific answer..."  No, it doesn't.  It's not even a constant.https://explainingscience.org/2015/08/24/september-18-the-sh...4.  This is the only work the author ever published (he died in 2009).So... if you read this and wondered why anyone should care, your puzzlement is well-founded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1972 the leap second was created.This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time and place are inseparable, and a lot of confusion about time can be resolved by being more specific about one’s position and velocity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548914</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My own experience has taught me that titles are kinda dumb, and at times very very insular, which seems to be the case here.I went from eng, to sr eng, to principal eng, back to eng, making more money each time along the way across different orgs.Our industry has little to no real standards.  Congrats on your promotion, but your title ultimately means little across companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in the Marines, I was promoted to Lance Corporal twice (and wasn't demoted between the two promotions.)  The unit I was in just wasn't that great with Admin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That means your manager has to be switched on and fully on board.Your manager also needs enough political capital to drive the promotion. This is something I have an acute awareness of, having been told for the last 3 years that I was operating at the principal level (no staff title here) but not getting promoted. Eventually my manager was forced out of the company by bullying from my skip-level, so now I'm left to look for a new role elsewhere or spend some unknown amount of time building the relationship with my new manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549029</guid></item><item><title>43.

Adding paths one at a time to a massive union is slow.This seem like more of a surprise to the author than it was for me.I’d say the takeaway is that treating everything like a black box doesn’t produce good results (sometimes). And not knowing enough to open the box completely leaves you with a lot of unknowns, surprises, and loose ends. But hey, figuring this stuff out is why we get paid the $$$.Sometimes it would help to read a book or consult someone more knowledgeable though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42541885</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the H5N1 avian influenza virus, detailing its history, transmission, and potential risks to human health. It emphasizes that while H5N1 has a high mortality rate in infected humans, cases are rare, and not all strains pose a significant threat. The author explores the complexities of understanding the virus's behavior, the challenges of predicting its evolution, and the implications for public health and safety. The piece additionally examines the interplay between science, media, and public perception regarding the risks associated with avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fear we have lost the collective will to conduct pandemic mitigation. The next time something bad comes round, we're just going to have it wash over us and Black Death it. It's a shame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how people's immune systems can get synced to the first flu they encounter. Coincidentally, the latest issue of Science has a paper finding that genetics is a more important factor than first exposure in determining which flu strain a person's immune system can fight best.https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2396&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see this mentioned in the article (or maybe I missed it), but what are the chances that it's already been circulating in the population (h2h) but causing very mild symptoms? It doesn't seem like we're testing for it unless a patient becomes hospitalized (and apparently even then it might take several ER trips before they decide to test). Are we relying on waste-water testing to determine community transmission then?I have a friend here in Oregon that came down with conjunctivitis for several days and then progressed to flu symptoms. It didn't hit him hard though and he recovered on his own just fine. I'm sure many pathogens can produce this same symptom progression, but it elevated my curiosity for sure.I see that Canadian teen who acquired H5N1 had a similar symptom progression and initially tested positive for flu strain A, but it wasn't until they did further testing specifically for H5N1 that it was discovered. I suspect these "last-resort" testing scenarios are quite common since most hospitals (particularly in the US) don't give enough of a damn to test further for cases that don't require over-night+ admission into the hospital or ICU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567069</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used a Framework 13" as my daily driver for 3 years. I still have it, and now I also have a Framework 16", which has been my daily driver for the last six months.The user serviceability and upgrade stories are real. The hardware isn't as svelte as Apple's, but mine has traveled all over the world and has yet to have any major issues. The one hardware failure I had was that the USB-C half of the charging cable on my 13" eventually broke after a few years of abuse, but that used to happen to me with Apple charging cables, too.Framework has an active initiative to do outreach to different Linux distro communities and give them free hardware to help shore up compatibility. And, on that note, I haven't run into any Linux hardware compatibility issues (not with Pop!_OS, or more recently NixOS).Speaking for myself, they have a loyal customer for as long as they continue to make this kind of hardware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bought a Framework 13" in 2022 (Intel 13th gen). It's equipped with 32GB ram and a 1TB drive.It has good intentions but falls short. I would say overall it is a mediocre laptop in terms of quality.Will it last longer than any other laptop? I would think so, it has a strong story of available parts and upgrades. Similarly I believe it would last longer than any other laptop, since you can essentially do a Ship of Theseus with it.Pain points:  - display hinge problem, picking up the laptop would make the screen lie flat 180 degrees, which is really annoying - this has been fixed in newer versions of framework, but to get a new hinge kit costs $39 AUD plus $30 AUD in shipping, so I'm not willing to make that purchase due to the ridiculous shipping price.

  - the modular ports are nice, but I'd rather just have fixed ports and more of them, of course that'd obstruct the repair/modularity story.

  - sometimes the modular ports do not work after resuming from a hibernate, I have to eject and reseat it.

  - the display is okay, I notice mine has a small granular line of off coloured pixels - i don't think this is due to any physical damage but rather a defect in the screen as I've never had this kind of issue with any other laptop and I've handled the framework fairly carefully; but this line of off coloured pixels is very faint and virtually unnoticeable at bright colours, so it's not a huge deal as I make it out to be.

  - the keyboard works great, but I was hoping for an upgrade to something along the lines of an apple style layout with half height inverted-t arrow keys and fn/ctrl swapped; the idea of a marketplace for custom parts doesn't seem to really exist.

  - Battery life of about 3-4 hours of very average usage.

  - Speakers are trash.

The webcam / mic are good enough.I run Linux on it, and seems to run pretty stable.I needed this laptop because I needed 32GB of ram for compile jobs. I have since got a macbook pro 16" with &gt;32GB of ram and it can compile what I need using Rosetta 2 for Linux (so amd64 compiles). Since my mac can now do everything I need, I very rarely touch my Framework. I loathe the idea of having to use it over a mac laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of contributing to more electronic waste and as an economic purchase, I...use used ThinkPads.Advantages:Zero new electronic waste created.Several 'new' machines are cheaper than a Framework.Small upgrades plentiful and cheap. A major upgrade of a'new' machine still cheaper and more environmentally friendly than a Framework.Better battery life, keyboard, ergonomic design, ports, hinges LOL, etc.Try one today: ebay.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564216</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of a spiral linked list in the C programming language, demonstrating how to create and manipulate this data structure. It provides a detailed explanation of the concept, along with sample code and illustrative diagrams to help users understand the structure and its operations. The content is intended for programmers looking to enhance their knowledge of linked lists by exploring this specific variation and its applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spiral rule works only if there is no pointer to pointer or array of array in the type. In other words it is an incorrect rule. But take this for example:        +----------------------------+
        | +-----------------------+  |
        | | +------------------+  |  |
        | | | +-------------+  |  |  |
        | | | | +--------+  |  |  |  |
        | | | | |  +--+  |  |  |  |  |
        | | | | |  ^  |  |  |  |  |  |
    int * * ¦ ¦ ¦ VAR[1][2][3] |  |  |
     ^  | | | | |     |  |  |  |  |  |
     |  | | | | +-----+  |  |  |  |  |
     |  | | | +----------+  |  |  |  |
     |  | | +---------------+  |  |  |
     |  | ---------------------+  |  |
     |  +-------------------------+  |
     +-------------------------------+

The type of VAR is a [1-element] array of [2-element] array of [3-element] array of pointer to pointer to ints. I drew a spiral that passes through each specifier in the correct order. To make the spiral correct it has to skip the pointer specifiers in the first three loops. This is marked by ¦.The Right-Left Rule is quoted less frequently on HN but it's a correct algorithm for deciphering C types: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/rt_lt.rule.htmlThe spiral rule can be modified to process all array specifiers before all pointer specifiers, but then you'd have to specify that the order to do so is right and then left. At that point it's just the Right-Left Rule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a C programmer, declarations in Go appeared "backwards" to me when I first saw them.IMO the Go syntax is a vast improvement as it's much simpler and avoids the clockwise/spiral issue: https://appliedgo.com/blog/go-declaration-syntax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proper way is to use /usr/bin/cdecl or https://cdecl.org and extract as many typedefs as reasonable from the gibberish, because in C most of the times you’ll need these anyway to address lifetimes and ownership/borrowing points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564861</guid></item><item><title>47. 40+ JackOfManyTrades needs advice for job search</title><link>item?id=42548572</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find that people get weird when interviewing those with more experience. Managers tend to be okay because they've accepted that they're not the specialists, but when you get a tech lead with 9y exp interviewing someone with 15y exp, it's weirder. Some put you on a pedestal, some get insecure and treat you like some dragon to be slain.Lots of people are T-shaped engineers, so they tend to interview in their domain of expertise and disregard someone else's T-shaped skill. Like you could be an amazing TDD implementer with an efficient code base, and then someone will grill you on how many bugs tests actually catch and bring up the myth of zero defect. Then they fight the candidate on home ground and ask questions on implementing encryption, because that's the Blub they know.This goes on and they have "trouble finding talent" until they finally find someone who has a very similar skill overlap to the interviewer. The team ends up T-shaped, when it should be square shaped, with different people making up for the weakness in these teams. In this economy, companies can be pickier, so the problem is worse.Your T-shaped experience is very much an advantage. I don't have a solution for this, other than making it clear what you're bringing to the team. Finding a job through a network might be one solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My bona fides: I am old and have done it all. I will now tell you how it worked out.Like you, I am a person who can do pretty much anything. I had nothing but success. Jobs came to me. Then, at around 45, the company I worked for went down and I found myself unemployed.Like you, my resume was unusual. I broke it into skill groups. It was obvious that I had a lot of accomplishments and, if hired, could help with almost any need. Nobody hired me.I did freelance work, started a company that didn’t work. Eventually needed a job again. Kept looking.Finally, I ran into a headhunter who told me the magic: Decide what you want to do and remove everything from your resume that does not apply to that specific topic. Do not allow even a hint of general-purpose skill to appear.She made me understand that nobody had a requisition for a ‘jack of all trades’. They have a requisition for a sales agent, bookkeeper, programmer, database guy. Specific stuff.I was broke and did what she said.In my case, my education and fundamental skill was programming. Gone were all of my proud accomplishments in favor of all the things I knew about PHP, MYSQL, LAMP of all sorts (this was in the ought). Also some things where I had helped a project team. It made me sad because I have done some very cool stuff that went by the wayside. But it was the resume of a professional programmer, dedicated to the craft.I have never been unemployed since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work for myself, so I don't interview for jobs, but I do interview for projects or interim positions.Being a generalist myself, my CV is also all over the place. I tailor my 'CV' to the company/project I'm interviewing for, so it appears less confusing. I have several versions where different skills and projects are highlighted, downplayed or even removed. I also write a tailored text for the position or project, making it explicitly clear why I would be a good fit, to make sure the person views me the way I want to be viewed. I try to ensure that my CV leaves no room for their personal interpretation. (many are often skeptical of a broad skillset, or lack the experience to properly value it)That said, it could also be the current economy that works against you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548572</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits of storing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes within a password manager. It argues that using a password manager for this purpose can enhance security and convenience, as it allows users to keep all their credentials—both passwords and 2FA codes—organized and accessible in one place. The author emphasizes that while there are risks associated with this approach, such as potential vulnerabilities in password managers, the security features they offer can mitigate those risks. Ultimately, the piece advocates for the streamlined management of 2FA codes through password managers for improved user experience and security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are better off security-wise with 2FA enabled than without it (for the phishing-related reasons mentioned in TFA - EDIT: taviso is correct in their comment, it's more about protection against credential stuffing than phishing), regardless of where you put the codes, so if being able to put the codes in your password manager is going to be the difference-maker in someone electing to use 2FA, they should do it.It's the same idea with using a password manager in the first place - if a password manager is going to be the thing that gets you to use secure passwords that vary across services, it's worth the tradeoff of having all of those passwords in one place, because you're much more likely to be compromised by a bad password than by a password manager leak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason I store 2FA codes in my password manager is as a protest to companies forcing me to have a 2FA. I don't want to be randomly locked out of my google account due to not having a usable 2FA, and I also don't want to depend on having a single device be always available to provide the codes.In practice, I feel the main reason 2FA is popular is because people cannot be trusted to create unique and secure passwords for every service. The phishing-resistance is nice, but I'd prefer it being the only credential, and just having it be autofilled (making it longer to combat bruteforce), like what we currently have with password managers...Here's to hoping passkeys turn out any better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I store 2FA keys in a fingerprint protected Aegis vault on my phone, and I periodically export an encrypted (with a master password I remember) backup that I then email to my parents.I get their argument that 2FA makes phishing more difficult, but I disagree that it's its "primary use", or that the distributed factor is unimportant. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable having all my important accounts behind Bitwarden's single point of failure. 2FA for important accounts mitigates the damage if my Bitwarden is broken into.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567279</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Sandia National Laboratories' advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) cooling techniques, highlighting innovative methods to manage the heat generated by powerful computing systems. It emphasizes the importance of effective cooling solutions to enhance computing performance and energy efficiency, as well as to reduce operational costs. The research focuses on developing technologies that can sustain and improve the performance of next-generation supercomputers while addressing environmental concerns and energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;None of this is particularly new. Horizontal submerging has been an area of research for at least 20 years. Spinny disks were a pain to do, because they need a certain amount of air to not have head crashes. (Sealed HDDs existed I'm sure. )The problem is that its not that practical. Firstly it much less dense than upright racks, secondly its almost certainly more heavy.What is happening now is direct watercooling to the rack. Currently in widespread use is effectively a back of rack "car" radiator (ie it looks like a rack sized car radiator), where the coolant is piped to the back of the rack.Another, newer, but needed for high density GPU, is coolant block direct to component cooling. Where you have a coolant manifold on the back of the rack with each server plumbed direct into the coolant loop.However, that doesn't solve the problem of what to do with the heat once you have it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article doesn't even mention the Cray-2 that used Flourinert for cooling.Flourinert turned out to be really bad for the environment, so I wonder if the article was meant to be how they have a new cooling fluid that is safer?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinert&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don‘t like how they mix up different ideas:1) having liquid instead of air as the first heat transporting medium
2) having water evaporation chillers instead of air heat exchangers and maybe heat pumps to chill the (last) heat transportation medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557142</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that while Next.js offers many powerful features for building React applications, it may not be necessary for all projects. It discusses alternatives and simpler approaches to building applications, emphasizing the importance of evaluating project requirements and considering the complexity of using Next.js. The piece encourages developers to choose the tools that best fit their needs, suggesting that often simpler solutions can be just as effective without the overhead associated with more complex frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what the issue is? People are so focused on being able to scale their idea to billions of users before they even start building it. So someone today would start using Kubernetes for their website with 5 visitors. I've seen many students use Nextjs for websites that could easily be written with plain html + css, and some chart library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built my latest project[1] with Next.js and it's often felt pretty hectic to use.App vs. pages router, accessing cookies requiring different APIs between the client-side and the server side, env vars being accessed via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` which gets rewritten into literal value of the env var (so if you access `process.env` directly you're very confused).I guess I was hoping that I'd be able to write code which would work on either the client-side or the server-side with minimal changes. But that's not what I experienced. For what Next.js does provide, it doesn't feel worth the overhead and the learning required to do it "the Next.js way".1 - https://onlyhumanhub.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so true! Our codebase got radically simpler when we did the exact same thing. And faster too, in terms of page rendering. It is very unfortunate that the whole community is being pushed onto frameworks like this unnecessarily.All most folks need is `npx rsbuild init`:https://rsbuild.dev/(And I love that the post authors are using rspack! I read the post after posting this comment. This was our exact same process. No more overhead of next -- just used rspack/rsbuilld and a simple router and beautiful simplicity everywhere, including 10ms hot reloads)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565502</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential benefits and challenges of the UK government considering a scheme to regulate online platforms, focusing on the balance between fostering innovation and protecting user rights.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is correct in that media DRM is tied to GPU vendors on the field right now.But hardware backed DRM can be so much more invasive beyond that. I have no doubts the long term goal of MS is to have a Windows version of Play Integrity.[0] So total control over everything that happens on your device. Just to give an example of what could happen if this becomes reality: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Environment_IntegrityThis tech extended to browsers could easily mean that sites could refuse to serve you if your machine is running any bigcorp unapproved software. An easy example of that would be adblockers.Unless we get lucky with secure world compromises like the Tegra X1 bootrom exploit[1] or get real good at passing legistlation that forces companies to give you all the private keys to your own machine, the future for personal computing is looking grim.[0]: https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity[1]: https://github.com/fail0verflow/shofel2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DRM is a government sanctioned desecration, by corporations, of your private property rights, by its very definition.Whether it’s in the GPU, CPU, TPM, or any other part of computing property you ostensibly own, is an utterly irrelevant distraction, the root is the unholy alliance of government and capital power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fully get the DRM hate.Now I don’t really follow the Windows world but I thought the goal of the newer TPM stuff was to be able to provide a trusted boot chain the way Apple does. I’m under the impression that some of the earlier versions allowed the TPM module to be a separate piece of hardware from the CPU and thus exposed an hardware attack path where someone could snoop or man in the middle.If you have a full trusted chain you can certainly use that to ensure that the DRM isn’t being tampered with. But I kind of doubt that’s the main reason behind all of it. There are enough good reasons they may want better security on the hardware outside of that it seems justifiable that they might push it.I’m not arguing it’s good or bad, I just don’t think it’s 100% about DRM and the rest is a smoke screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570988</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Zasper is an open-source project designed to enhance developer productivity by simplifying the process of building and managing APIs. It provides a flexible framework that allows users to easily create, test, and document their APIs, all while integrating with various authentication methods and third-party services. The project emphasizes ease of use, with comprehensive documentation and modular architecture, making it suitable for both new developers and experienced programmers looking to streamline their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am the author of Zasper.The unique feature of Zasper is that the Jupyter kernel handling is built with Go coroutines and is far superior to how it's done by JupyterLab in Python.Zasper uses one fourth of RAM and one fourth of CPU used by Jupterlab. While Jupyterlab uses around 104.8 MB of RAM and 0.8 CPUs, Zasper uses 26.7 MB of RAM and 0.2 CPUs.Other features like Search are slow because they are not refined.I am building it alone fulltime and this is just the first draft. Improvements will come for sure in the near future.I hope you liked the first draft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's probably an unrelated post (apologies in advance) but I wanted to shoutout to the Marimo (https://marimo.io), it's the only Jupyter alternative that really got me excited, it's like Streamlit and Jupyter had a kid (and the kid took the best genes from both).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the advantage of this? It isn’t obvious to me that reducing memory usage and CPU of an empty/idle kernel is all that meaningful if the actual Python code in your notebook uses far more resources. It’s also not obvious to me how Go’s better threading helps, either, if all the computational bits are in Python anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572057</guid></item><item><title>3. uBlock Origin GPL code being stolen by team behind honey browser extension</title><link>https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1hr6xjc/ubo_quick_filters_list_being_stolen_by_team/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The project "mitmproxy2swagger" is a tool that facilitates the conversion of API request and response data captured with mitmproxy into the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification format. This tool aims to streamline the documentation and design processes for APIs by automatically generating Swagger files from the traffic monitored through mitmproxy, thus saving developers time and effort in creating and maintaining API documentation. The repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and guidelines for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who used Revit for 5 years before moving to develop and maintain custom Revit API apps full-time, I have many horror stories I could share (feel free to AMA). I can say that the latest version of Revit (R2025) is largely a single-threaded application, and has only just upgraded their back-end from .Net Framework 4.8.1 to .Net8.0. The company continuously and openly takes breathtakingly blatant advantage of their user base and is at worst adversarial to their users. The software captures and exchanges a surprising amount of data during usage (to the point that Revit itself is hard to distinguish between malware by network cybersec software). Autodesk is a walking-talking timebomb of an antitrust suit waiting to happen. With that said, Revit does a lot of things well and there are no realistic alternatives. Personally, I have always found community responses on forums very helpful while autodesk support has ranged from helpful, to useless, to simultaneously counter-productive and insulting. Jeremy Tammik (officially affiliated with Autodesk these days) and his “The Building Coder Blog” is a very nice reference for Revit API and he is somehow EVERYWHERE on the forums.edit: the open letter posted here by another user does a very good job detailing many broad issues (with Revit in particular); every point it makes is accurate in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urgh, cultural vandalism.The challenge here is that there are people out there who just do not understand the inherent value of this kind of old content. If any company exists for long enough eventually some of those people will cycle into positions of decision-making authority where they get to "save costs" or "clean things up" by delete-hammering some invaluable artifact like this one.The correct way to handle this is to add a BIG banner on top of older content like this warning "This post is from 12 years ago, and may no longer reflect the most recent version of our software".Flattening a bunch of dynamic pages to static HTML can also be useful, if the concern is maintaining old forum software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately the "internet doesn't forget" statement has been false since many years. Most companies couldn't care less about keeping the wealth information they've accumulated accessible.I remember a few years ago TI got bored with updating their cpuwiki, and deleted the whole this - which stings to this day. The internet is still full of links to it to solve crucial issues, only to be greeted with a disappointing error message.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571995</guid></item><item><title>6.

It highlights the company's origins, tracing back to its founding in 1623, and discusses its significance in the music industry, particularly in drumming.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Zildjian" is an Armenian last name, but "Zildji" (zilci) means "cymbalist"/"cymbal-maker", or more generically, "bell-maker" in Turkish. "-ian" is the Armenian patronymic suffix. The whole word means something like "Cymbalistson" which makes it the most fitting company name to produce cymbals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zildjian's original craftsmanship actually lives on in Istanbul. Mehmet Tamdeger, who began apprenticing at age nine under Mikhail Zilcan (grandson of Kerope Zilcan, of K series fame) and master smith Kirkor Kucukyan, continued the traditional techniques from the 1950s K. Zilcan factory in Istanbul.What's fascinating is that Tamdeger and master smith Agop Tomurcuk preserved these methods by founding "Istanbul" cymbals. Initially exporting to the US under "Zildjiler" before switching to "Istanbul" in 1984, each cymbal was personally signed by both masters. After Agop's unexpected death in 1996, Mehmet continued under "Istanbul Mehmet", maintaining the 17th-century hand-crafting methods with the philosophy "Machines don't have ears."The cymbals they make are particularly sought after by jazz drummers for what's known as the "old K sound" - referring to the original K Zildjians made in its place of birth.Here is one for sale:https://soundsanatolian.com/products/istanbul-mehmet-22-mika...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use a mix of cymbals, also Zildjian, and the last years I've moved more to Istanbul cymbals but did not know this part of history and the connection the craft had to the old city. It is not surprising, though. Istanbul has a history as a cultural center since the Roman empire and before, holding its position long after Rome fell. It is one of my favorite cities in the world because of the mix of cultures across crafts and arts, and people - also within music. It's role in the cymbal and drum making history just adds to my impression. Istanbul unfortunately currently is a shadow of what it was, after many years of Erdogan and his followers' efforts to make Turkey less liberal and secular. I do hope history will show that this will turn, and that Istanbul will continue to be a metropol of blended cultures and creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42560069</guid></item><item><title>7. iTerm2 critical security release</title><link>https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by the comments saying "Just don't use iTerm2." The same class of issue can occur for any other project, and switching is not a very effective defense against it.If anything, having an embarrassing issue like this is probably going to improve the iTerm2 project's security posture in the medium term. It's like that joke about firing the engineer who caused the incident, and the manager who retorts, "Why would I fire them? They just learned the hard way never to make this mistake again." (I'm paraphrasing.) I don't think that iTerm2 has had a notably high rate of critical security issues, and I suspect they won't make this class of mistake twice. (And if they do - then I will re-evaluate.)I suppose intuitively I would think that using the default MacOS Terminal app is a bit lower-risk than using iTerm2 or any other open source terminal emulator, as Terminal is a rather sparse piece of Apple-provided software with a low pace of change. But it's also closed source and impossible to audit, so there are tradeoffs there too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the replies here, I am not even sure how to react, it seems this community overall is going into a sad direction that just blames instead of trying to think of solutions.Most of them are just entitled and aggressive for absolutely no reason.It's perfectly fine to want to switch, or try something else, but to think other projects couldn't have issues is just naive to say it gently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel deeply for the developer who develops iTerm for relatively very little money, and already took a lot of criticism for the AI integration, far more than was warranted.I am also also deeply concerned about my use of iTerm now.I access HPC environments where I may have access for a short period of time. I am expected to take responsibility to clear out my data after use and don't expect there to be any data leakage. If I had been manipulating PII research data in the past year and using iTerm's SSH integration I would be in a bit of a bind and have to send some really embarrassing emails asking sysadmins to see if these logs exist, and if they belong to me, followed by disclosing data had been leaked.I use some of the more advanced features but at this point wonder if I should be using any features beyond the basic, and then I may as well be using another terminal. I haven't found a cross-platform editor that feels as native on MacOS as iTerm, ghostty included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579472</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Although I was on an AI team, I often pushed back against applying AI unless we had a really compelling reason. What is the user problem we are trying to solve? Do we really need an LLM or could a few if statements suffice? Are we sure that natural language is the appropriate interface for this?This practical approach to AI feels refreshing in a field drowning in buzzwords. I’ve built tools where simple regression models outperformed neural networks, and convincing teams was an uphill battle. It's hard to not get pushback from teams for not going all-in on AI when it seems decisions and budgets are hype-driven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have had a somewhat similar journey but 14 years instead of 25 and I always wonder how it would be different today.We were lucky enough to grow up with the industry and progressively learn more complexity. The kids out of school today are faced with decades worth of complexity on day one on the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It makes such a refreshing change to have a web page not cluttered with adverts and popups.  Just nice, clean, well-spaced-out text and simple organisation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569913</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of UUID version 7 and its monotonicity, focusing on the importance of having unique identifiers that maintain their order over time. It explains how UUID v7 is designed to provide time-based, sortable, and unique values while addressing the challenges of random and non-monotonic identifiers. The author explores the advantages of using UUID v7 in various applications, particularly for distributed systems, and provides insights into implementation considerations to ensure efficiency and reliability in generating these UUIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would strongly implore people not to follow the example this post suggests, and write code that relies on this monotonicity.The reason for this is simple: the documentation doesn't promise this property. Moreover, even if it did, the RFC for UUIDv7 doesn't promise this property. If you decide to depend on it, you're setting yourself up for a bad time when PostgreSQL decides to change their implementation strategy, or you move to a different database.Further, the stated motivations for this, to slightly simplify testing code, are massively under-motivating. Saving a single line of code can hardly be said to be worth it, but even if it were, this is a problem far better solved by simply writing a function that will both generate the objects and sort them.As a profession, I strongly feel we need to do a better job orienting ourselves to the reality that our code has a tendency to live for a long time, and we need to optimize not for "how quickly can I type it", but "what will this code cost over its lifetime".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember even if timestamps may be generated using a monotonically increasing value that does not mean they were committed in the same order to the database. It is an entirely separate problem if you are trying to actually determine what rows are "new" versus "previously seen" for things like cursor-based APIs and background job processing. This problem exists even with things like a serial/autoincrement primary key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The Postgres patch solves the problem by repurposing 12 bits of the UUID’s random component to increase the precision of the timestamp down to nanosecond granularity [...]&gt;It makes a repeated UUID between processes more likely, but there’s still 62 bits of randomness left to make use of, so collisions remain vastly unlikely.Does it? Even though the number of random bits has decreased, the time interval to create such a duplicate has also decreased, namely to an interval of one nanosecond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575900</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;MiniKanren is a minimalist programming language aimed at teaching logic programming and relational programming concepts. It uses a small set of core abstractions to facilitate reasoning about programs and enable the development of complex queries and relationships between data. The website provides resources, including documentation, tutorials, and examples, to help users understand and implement MiniKanren in various contexts, promoting its use in both educational settings and advanced programming applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humble brag:This brought back shades of 20 years ago to me. I went back to school to add a credential after my name to make myself employable. My experience running the back office for a long-distance reseller (FoxPro 2.6 database: application support, running customer service, billing, reporting, and being the networking yeoman) didn't look impressive on my resume without some additional alphabet soup.This was my programming languages -- interpreters class. Dr Daniel Friedman ran a teach-along that culminated in implementing miniKanren in scheme. First day of class, the front row was empty. I was ten years older than every other student in the room (with the exception of Will Byrd). I sheepishly shrugged and took one of the offered seats in the row. For the next hour, the sheer force of scheme being written on the whiteboard blew my mind open. That continued for 16 weeks, three days a week. I highly recommend the experience.I (probably) still have a pre-press copy of The Reasoned Schemer in a box in my attic. It was one of the goodies handed out on the last day of class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minikanren was the subject of a phenomenal talk by Matt Might for it's applications in medicine[0] https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/algorithm-for-precisio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while back I was trying to understand the guts of miniKanren. I Did a careful reading of the paper and wrote up my notes along with the code here: https://codeberg.org/ashton314/microKanrenHope that helps someone. :) It’s a fantastic little gem of a program.Don’t forget: https://aphyr.com/posts/354-unifying-the-technical-interview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574125</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to diagnose an unusual Wi-Fi issue characterized by intermittent connectivity problems. It outlines a systematic approach to identify the root cause, including checking hardware, examining network configurations, and using diagnostic tools. The author emphasizes the importance of documenting the troubleshooting process and presents specific tests to perform, such as signal strength analysis and interference detection. Additionally, potential solutions are offered, ranging from adjusting router settings to considering firmware updates. The aim is to equip readers with the knowledge to resolve similar Wi-Fi issues effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very similar to an issue I battled for months on MacBook Pro (one of the later Intel versions, like 2018-ish), although there problem was not in the HW itself but the current version of MacOS at that time (this is no longer an issue).I noticed that my WiFi had similar repeating lags .. about every 8-10s pings would go to a few hundred ms and then return to single/low double digits.Long story short, the problem was with several MacOS  components (and maybe some 3rd party software) requesting Location services to determine Mac’s position. To do that, among other things, Mac scans WiFi around you (probably for the names/SSID?) and to do that, the current WIFI connection is temporarily put on a back burner, resulting in a brief delay in traffic. The solution was to minimize location services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;First, I purchased a new, highly-reviewed, wifi adapter on Amazon.This is not how you find a high quality product on Amazon.&gt;It didn’t resolve the issue. It did, however, come with an offer for a free 64GB flash drive in exchange for a good reviews.Now you  know why it was so highly reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was certain that I read about a very similar issue here in the past, and after some searching, found this exact article posted 2 years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32524702&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575990</guid></item><item><title>13.

Might be worth putting that in the title.---&gt; Models with around 125M parameters such as GPT-Neo (small) or GPT-2 (small) can rarely generate coherent and consistent English text beyond a few wordsThese models are 5 years old.I have to wonder if the authors have seen RWKV 7 0.1B, because it blows away just about every other model I've seen at that size.The capabilities it has vs the examples in the paper are night and day.https://huggingface.co/spaces/BlinkDL/RWKV-Gradio-1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're doing a successor to this, working hard and going public in month or so, hopefully.

We used this dataset from Tiny Stories to train small models (as small as 20M params) and test out knowledge addition. Published a paper based on this dataset.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the versatility of Ruby on Rails as a framework that can be applied to a wide range of projects beyond traditional web applications. It highlights the benefits of using Rails for different types of applications, such as APIs, command-line tools, and data processing tasks. The author emphasizes the framework's convention over configuration approach, robust libraries, and community support that make it suitable for various programming challenges. The piece encourages developers to leverage Rails for innovative solutions and showcases its adaptability across different domains.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been building some apps with stacks lately that are supposed to be more modern and performant. Namely an app with Spring Boot and another with Micronaut. Both had a React frontend. It really made me appreciate Rails' omakase approach. Just having a form that shows validation errors from the backend and having something as simple as Rails' flash messages isn't solved by the frameworks themselves and requires you to build it yourself or find a third-party solution that might or might not do the basic thing you need or might or might not be well-supported. Rails truly solves the problems 90% of web apps share. It might not be in a way that's perfect for your specific project but it will likely work and you can swap it out one you've validated you app or feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails is awesome, and so is Django. I’ve built mission-critical apps in both and still do with Python. That said, I’d love to switch to Go for building large monoliths since it has a tighter type system and better concurrency constructs.The problem is, Go community has never really filled that gap. I love Go, but the whole "Go doesn’t need a Rails or Django" mindset is part of why it hasn’t taken off in this space. Building networking tools and CLIs in Go is great, but when it comes to quickly building a full-stack web app, I still reach for Rails or Django. So this whole "X is dead" doesn't apply to Rails at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if you follow (the Rails Guides) start to finish, you'll have a Rails app in production. And it isn't just hello world. Your app will have authentication, caching, rich text, continuous integration, and a database. That's a real application.These features are great for established apps like GitHub and Airbnb, but if you're making a tiny startup, and want to test ideas quickly, I wouldn't spend time on CI, caching, Rails's authentication (use extremely feature rich Devise gem), Rails's 'turbo' features, and writing tests. These are all good things for medium or larger apps, or well-funded apps with a long run way, but are usually cost-benefit negative for small apps.Turbo saves a fraction of a second on many page loads, but can add days of development time for those not fluent in javascript when it causes some core functionality to not work (e.g. devise's Log out!). Testing is very important on large apps but for quickly flicking a few ideas together and getting it in front of users; unless you're a banking or healthcare app, they can probably be postponed until you have traction.Be mindful of your size and timelines and don't succumb to 'default bias' where you use things simply because they were there out of the box. Feel confident to say 'no, we don't need that (for now)'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569236</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nicely done. I know this seems crazy at first but in my opinion big SQLs are one of the best ways to store complexity.The problem being complex is the issue. SQL is a standard, condensed, extremely performant, actually testable, and logical language. Sure, not anybody can instantly maintain it but that would be the same as if it was a lot of lines and functions in Java. The more lines the more risk for bugs.I also love how deep SQL goes. And that makes totally sense. It powers the world of data since 40+ years so of course people asked for niche features. One of my favorite is the model clause in Oracle with which you can implement multidimensional arrays. A friend implemented Conway's game of life with it in way less lines you expect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been writing a ton of SQL -- implementing a lot of the business logic of a (stream processing) application in it. I really really like it, especially that I bring the computation to the data instead of the data to the computation.I often talk to developers who hate that idea though. They want me to instead move all the data to the backend, for a massive IO hit, just so that the computations can be expressed in a "real" programming language.I think SQL the concept is good but SQL the language is the problem. There are so many awkward things in it -- not strange as it has had no competition in 40(?) years!! The mental model of the program I write is fine but I really need to overlook the syntax and to the program I am really writing to see any elegance...What we need I think is a properly designed programming language, designed for existing databases (Postgres, MSSQL) compiling to SQL dialects. I see some contenders but they all have some attachment to a special domain, such as not allowing data modifications (PreQL) or being associated with other databases.Itching to do it myself, but it's a lot of work and a long long road to any adoption with no guarantee of success, and no revenue stream that I can think of.The most popular backend languages were made by large companies, but I think coding in SQL is in a catch-22 where it will be frowned upon until there is a better language and no better language until it is more popular..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reacted to this title the way I react a new menu item at Taco Bell: a strange mixture of desire, shame, and admiration for human ingenuity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577736</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the dilemma faced by wealthy individuals who struggle with finding purpose and direction in their lives despite their financial success. It emphasizes the contrast between material wealth and personal fulfillment, exploring the potential lack of motivation, identity, and meaningful goals that can arise when one is financially secure. The author encourages readers to seek deeper meaning through personal interests, meaningful relationships, and contributing to society, rather than relying solely on wealth for happiness. Ultimately, it advocates for a balanced approach to life that prioritizes fulfillment over mere financial abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

And shows a lot about he doesn’t have any people relying on him or community to support. He takes one hike and throws away 60m. Doesn’t try to find anything interesting to do at Atlassian just calls his coworkers NPCs. This is zero-empathy Peter Pan syndrome at its worse.Sad how he just goes adventure hopping to try and find meaning. The problem is no matter where you are you are also there. Time to look inward and not outward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think you have to have Fuck You Money to get to this point. Most people eventually become disillusioned with work enough that they reevaluate what matters to them. Getting a very profitable exit is just one way to trigger that experience.In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I'm not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It's a way of taking back control.When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I've nurtured...a lot more than what I've built, in most ways. I've heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like "I now enjoy making other people rich."No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't imagine a world where I wouldn't know what to do.There is diarrhea on my building,  trash in the street, people needing medical help in the alley, and potholes in the street.Just walk out your front door and start doing things.My recent triumph was getting a building owner on my street to finally repair the hole in front of their building.  Imagine what I could do with a backhoe.Start small, think big.  Help people who deserve it in real, honest (typically not through the computer) ways.I'd much rather be less wealthy in that way to be rich in this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579873</guid></item><item><title>17.

Make sure you have 64GB of RAM. I only had 16GB, but allocating additional 48GB of swap worked.There are probably some redundant steps, but this worked for me last time I tried.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This project is the first that tickles my brain in the right serendipitous ways; it merges topics of my recent interests.However, after a VERY short perusal, I grew a giant sense of empathy for non-native English speakers. The readme is gentle enough to English speakers (aka: +95% English) no less I felt like I muddled through renaming tokens in my mind as I went. However, that quickly showed me two things.1. It reminds me why I never seem to finish classic Russian literature… so often get lost in the introductory parade of names that are a cache miss for my usual set of names.2. This is perhaps a significant cultural muscle that has never been necessitated for English speakers. Since the earth has largely been using English (in some capacity) for significantly longer than my life span - as my favorite joke says in the punch line “what do you call someone who only knows one language… uni-lingual… jk: American”PS: it seems like there could be an open registry maintained by “Americans like me” who would rather pre-process the code for tokens within the docs and src… seems like a “DefinitelyTyped style” definitions registry would be very niche, but SUPER useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I posted a link to this project a few weeks ago as well! It's really interesting to see an academic project like this one.For people interested, there's bi-weekly blogs (some in English) linked here: https://docs.xiangshan.cc/zh-cn/latest/blog/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576242</guid></item><item><title>18.

RAG in my experience usually requires a decent amount of customization to your input data for chunk formatting and other things to work well,  are these systems flexible enough?What if you want to integrate it into an existing system, are these for local use only? So everyone on e.g. a team has to set it up themselves?Kinda curious what the exact use case is I have seen a few of these repos with 10k+ stars but don't really get what it's used for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great. Integrations with Graphrag framework is helpful.Are you able to monitor Token and Cost per user and per session?Also, lots of times users have the same  question worded differently .Is there a cost effective way of answering them from cache?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571272</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;RWKV is an innovative approach to neural network models, particularly focusing on recurrent models that combine the strengths of both transformer and RNN architectures. The website highlights the development of the RWKV model, which aims to efficiently handle long sequences of data while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in language processing tasks. It provides insights into the model's design, its implementation, and practical applications, emphasizing its potential in natural language understanding and generation. Additionally, the site showcases community engagement and resources for those interested in exploring or contributing to the RWKV project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;for those who want a more conversational intro, we've been covering RWKV for a bit!2023: https://latent.space/p/rwkv2024: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPe6iC73lrc &lt;- offers a bit of professional compare and contrast vs state space models.i think its cool that now both RNN and LSTM (with xLSTM) now have modern attention-inspired variants that solve the previous issues. I wonder if 1) its possible to overcome the "hardware lottery" that transformers have now won, and 2) if recurrent/selective state can do the kind of proper lookback on extremely long context that we will want it to do to compete with full attention (easy to say no, harder to propose what to do about it).there's also Liquid AI, whatever it is that they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idea for killer app for recurrent models: low latency, low memory LLM / TTS coupling. Start decoding / generating speech as soon as new tokens are generated. When the LLM is cranking out token t, the TTS is already working on token t-1. It doesn’t have to wait. Then when the LLM is finished, the TTS is nearly finished too. The two models being colocated you just saved another network call as well.Recurrent models with constant hidden state are naturally suited to streaming data, potentially opening the door to unexplored new use cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, im Eugene / PicoCreator - co-leading the RWKV project - feel free to AMA =)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42554161</guid></item><item><title>21. 4.5M Suspected Fake Stars in GitHub</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13459</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive examination of the concept of "adaptive invariance," which refers to the ability of certain systems to maintain consistent properties despite changes in parameters or environments. It discusses the theoretical foundations of adaptive invariance, explores its implications across various scientific domains, and offers insight into its potential applications in fields like robotics and ecology. The authors aim to deepen the understanding of how systems can adapt while retaining crucial invariance, potentially leading to advancements in both theoretical and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another interesting way - and I personally think its fraudulent. This is how it goes - run hackathons or sponsor events in Universities. There are a ton of colleges who are constantly seeking support to run events.Some companies take advantage of this by asking for stars in return of sponsorship. I have seen proposals that say for a $2000 sponsorship - 2000 stars guaranteed. The way it works is if a participant registers in the event they also have to show proof that they starred a specific repo that belongs to the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All metrics will be gamed at some point. I don't know exactly how you could even fight this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t like stars as a metric. Or at least as a comparator. If you brag about having a millions stars that says something as a million is a lot.But if you brag that your project as a million and your competitor has half a million, that is so illogical that I would discount your project and think it’s run by dummies.Are there practical situations where people really need stars enough to buy them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540182</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the principles of effective presentation design based on Edward Tufte's guidelines, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and the use of data visualization. It critiques common issues found in PowerPoint presentations, such as overcrowded slides, excessive text, and poor visual design. The author advocates for a more thoughtful approach to presentation creation, encouraging the use of well-designed graphs and charts that convey information clearly and engage the audience. The goal is to enhance the overall impact of presentations through better design practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody has the patience anymore to be presented to or read in any form other than bullet points and low information density charts.I grew up before computers and learned to communicate in the absence of all the short attention span distractions that exist today.  I remember the first time I picked up a Wired magazine and couldn’t tolerate the insane lack of continuity.  I still cannot stand the video style of images projected for a fraction of a second one after the other.But no one has the patience for my storytelling style.  Congratulations if you got this far, most people gave up if they didn’t grok my point in the first two sentences.Yes slideware is ugly and low information and boring and insulting to the audience, but some people, particularly in higher levels of management, just want to be spoon fed bullet lists and then feel like they’re making informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibly unpopular opinion: PowerPoint is just a tool, and most people not only suck at making slides but are poor storytellers to boot. If you are a good storyteller and can effectively use the medium (as in, not just dump a bunch of bullets on a slide), you can actually convey a lot of information in a combined slide + narrative format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this criticises PowerPoint - I don't think it sufficiently outlines an alternative.As someone that has tried to write a decision paper before rather than a PowerPoint deck, I found the main challenge was engagement (i.e. encouraging people to read it is a challenge, while a powerpoint can be walked through together).I could present a spreadsheet, but that only addresses the financials or numbers and won't address the business context.And if you go into a board meeting empty handed to talk about a large investment - good luck!I think it's probably a case of horses-for-courses: Sometimes PowerPoint is a great format, other times it might not be, and like any format it can either be used well or poorly. The issue in the Columbia example wasn't PowerPoint per-se, it was that the managers weren't clear in their communication.And while bullet points are poor in some ways - they are great in others. Distilling ideas down and making sure your list is MECE is part of clear communication and thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549147</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidelines for creating effective software tutorials, emphasizing the importance of clarity, engagement, and accessibility. It highlights key rules such as knowing the audience, structuring content logically, using concise language, incorporating visuals, and including practical examples. The aim is to ensure tutorials are informative and easily comprehensible, facilitating better learning experiences for users seeking to enhance their software skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of good advice about details!Especially one that got my heart:&gt; Some authors design their tutorials the way you’d give instructions for an origami structure. It’s a mysterious sequence of twists and folds until you get to the end, and then: wow, it’s a beautiful swan!&gt; A grand finale might be fun for origami, but it’s stressful for the reader."Yes, a lot of tutorials are puzzle games. You need to guess other tools to install, which are obvious to the author, but not everyone.I would add a few things:* Have two types of examples - minimal and the most typical (one is to show the essence without distraction, the second to serve as a practical starting point) 
* Always provide the full code sequence to run code; if there are any assumptions, these should be listed explicitly (e.g. "it needs Node 22"); you hinted a bit, but since many tutorials miss that, it deserves attention.Even better, if it is possible to combine it into one point and make it runnable. For example, for a package I had been developing, livelossplot, I made  Jupyter Notebooks runnable in Colab:* https://colab.research.google.com/github/stared/livelossplot...
* https://colab.research.google.com/github/stared/livelossplot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that plenty of developers read this, especially folks on open source projects who don't have dedicated documentation people. There's so much bad documentation out there, and many of these tips are key.A couple more of my own:TEST YOUR DOCSAs @codetrotter suggests in another comment, run through your own tutorial with a fresh VM and follow it closely; you'll almost certainly find something to improve.But this works better if you have someone else try it out instead: get on a video call with them, have them share their screen and speak their thoughts out loud, and most importantly, don't help them. You're trying to find out if they can complete this without additional help. (Yes, it's a usability test.)BETTER SOFTWARE MAKES SIMPLER TUTORIALSThe article's rule about "let computers evaluate conditional logic" is a good one, but there are multiple places to fix that problem. Sometimes it's in the tutorial, sometimes it's in the software product itself. When the tutorial makes the reader do complex work, it may be a sign that the software has UX issues. You may not be in a position to fix it, but you can probably file an issue.For the example in the article: could you make the same package name work on all three Debian versions? It'd certainly improve the user experience, and probably make the installation process more resilient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.I've been thinking for a long time about anti-patterns I see when following software tutorials, so I put together this list of things I think differentiate good tutorials from poor ones.I'm happy to hear any feedback on this list or hear about other things I should include.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574641</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;Mercure is an open-source protocol and project designed to enable real-time communication between web applications and clients, allowing them to receive updates from a server instantly. It leverages the HTTP/2 protocol for efficient delivery and supports a pub/sub model where publishers can send events to subscribers. The repository provides comprehensive documentation, installation steps, and examples for implementation, making it easy for developers to integrate real-time features into their applications. Additionally, it emphasizes security through features like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took a decent amount of digging, but it seems like this is trying to be a browser-compatible pubsub system more than a direct websocket replacement. The main thing they're doing is introducing a "mercure hub" between event producers and consumers (browsers) that handles delivery through SSE in a way that tracks subscribers and handles sporadic or interrupted connection.However what confuses me is that they seem to focus mostly on the protocol, hub, and publish implementation. At least based on a quick glance at https://mercure.rocks/docs/ecosystem/awesome and elsewhere it seems they expect you to use raw SSE clientside according to their protocol described in eg https://mercure.rocks/spec#active-subscriptions.Most of their clientside examples look pretty simple but they don't seem like they're fully implementing the logic described in "Reconnection, State Reconciliation and Event Sourcing" which seems rather complex. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems like that logic is the entire reason to use this over SSE alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please explain why this is better than websockets.I read the Github readme, but it doesn't say what's better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also I could recommend https://github.com/slact/nchan. It has the same idea: hide  and abstract pubsub complexity for a backend service. nchan is built on top of nginx and could be more convenient (existing nginx configuration knowledge) to deploy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571651</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to strike down the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality rules, which aimed to ensure an open internet by preventing internet service providers from blocking or throttling access to content. The ruling reflects ongoing legal and political debates surrounding net neutrality, with implications for how internet services are regulated in the U.S. The article highlights the arguments supporting and opposing net neutrality, the potential impact on consumers and businesses, and the possibility of future regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always felt the FCC was an inappropriate path for enforcing this. Ideally it would be powers granted to the FTC either through legislation or potentially through existing powers they might already have in this domain.The FCC's jurisdiction on this was already shaky even before Chevron was overturned, I think the moment activism was pushed in this direction net neutrality was doomed a decade of unending lawsuits. Even if they somehow made it passed the courts, I'm not quite convinced the FCC would be motivated to actually do much about this even with a sympathetic administration. Consider that prior to the internet, they were pretty much created to do the opposite of what people want from net neutrality.These are just my armchair thoughts though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised this legal turn has so little discussion on HN right now.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Meta's initiative to integrate more artificial intelligence bots into its platforms, Facebook and Instagram. It highlights the company's strategy to enhance user experience by using AI to power features such as chatbots and personalized content recommendations. The push for increased AI functionality aligns with broader trends in social media aiming to engage users more effectively while also addressing concerns regarding privacy and content moderation.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This gave me a funny idea for a new social media app...One that's centered around "you" and filled with thousands/millions of LLM bots praising you, treating you like a celebrity, etc. Each of your posts will get tens of thousands of "likes", hundreds of comments, etc. Dm's straight to your feed, people wanting you, etc etc.If the newsfeed is already mostly "the algorithm", might as well take it to the extreme. I bet tons of people would get addicted to the dopamine hit of celebrity status (whether it's bots or not).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My FB timeline is already a complete mess with most irrelevant garbage as it stands. Not exactly sure what adding additional 'noise' is going to achieve outside of boosting numbers (which I guess is what they want).A current snapshot my feed:  - Group post (from one I follow)  
  - Ad  
  - Post (from company I don't follow)  
  - Group post (from Group I don't follow)  
  - Group post (from one I follow)

I gave up writing the above, but it was about 9 more posts before I saw a post from a person I actually know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook Meta has been making baffling bets lately. They spent tens of billions building a metaverse with the belief that people want to spend their days in a creepy legless 3d avatar of themselves that is pretty effective at simulating what it feels to have body dysphoria, playing with their other legless friends and spending a lot of money customizing their dysphoric avatars.Now they believe what users really want from social media is less social human connection. What users really want is AI spam and parasocial relationships with corporate AI celebrities. They don't want Facebook to tackle the problem of fake celebrities and fake profiles of handsome men sending friend requests in an attempt to romance scam them, what they really want is more fake profilesI really believe Zuckerberg is a lizard after all, I can't find any other sane explanation for this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571608</guid></item><item><title>27.

Might help get you pluggable NAT traversal and transport strategies plus peer discovery. We’ve been using rust-libp2p for building an overlay network and have had decent success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice. I really like the config format regarding the services available/exposed.Any particular reasons you haven't built upon wireguard that would handle encryption/security for you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggestion for the quickstart: refer to the clients as either D,S or a,b throughout - I found the mixture a bit confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575841</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of effectively managing knowledge in organizations beyond traditional approaches, such as rag (red-amber-green) systems. It emphasizes building a comprehensive knowledge management framework that fosters collaboration, innovation, and learning. The author highlights strategies for capturing, sharing, and utilizing knowledge, along with the role of technology in enhancing these processes. The piece advocates for a cultural shift towards valuing knowledge as a key asset, ultimately aiming to improve decision-making and organizational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After trying out a bunch of digital zettelkasten tools, I just went back to paper.This take may be a bit hot, but I actually think paper and pen is already the optimal maxima for thinking—not for retrieval, mind you, but for helping us produce new thoughts. Zettelkasten (at least the way Luhmann used it) is meant for this purpose—it is not a system for storing information and retrieving it but rather for supporting the creation of new connections.The computer aided tools are suboptimal for this because they lack the good constrains of paper (severely limiting the search space) and the good features (seamless ability to incorporate a variety of representational modes, text, image, equation, with zero overhead, and the ability to organize things freely in space). As much as the digital knowledge base sounds good in theory, I don't think it will ever be as optimal for generation of thought. If all you want to do is summon existing information, digital tools are evidently superior. I personally think a hybrid system where one "thinks" on paper and "archives" digitally (after the thinking is done) might be best, but ultimately, we will be most productive with whatever system we actually enjoy using.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; From Socrates worrying that writing would destroy memory [...]  Think of it as a partnership: the computer handles the organizational heavy lifting, while you focus on the thinking.I'm less worried about memory per se and more about failing to think, or getting brainwashed/ring-led by a system with its own biases and quirks. Any sufficiently complex organizing is thinking!Perhaps the simplest example is when quantities (numbers, easy to record) get a mental weight that overshadows and hides their dimensions (the definitions, what they really mean.) For example, a tendency to automatically assume a rising GDP number is an unqualified good sign.Stuff like LLMs bring that into newer and more-dangerous territory, because the model also contains uncountable subtle biases from its training data, and even if you know it isn't aligned (heh) with your own mental models you can't reliably change it. Much like false-memories implanted by interrogators, patterns in those systems can and will leak into the users. Whenever we can't "think about how our thinking is being changed", I'd say that's axiomatically bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When you're dealing with ten notes, it's trivial to dump them into an LLM and generate connections. With a hundred notes, it's still manageable. But what happens when you hit 10,000 notes? Or a million? We quickly run into the limitations of context windows and processing capacity. Vector search helps narrow things down, but it's prone to missing important connections that a human mind might naturally make.I run into the same problem. I made a RAG system and imported 15 years of reddit and HN content (my own message logs) + 2 years of LLM chats, totaling about 80MB of text. I can use it to retrieve fragments but there is duplication, and almost all duplicate fragments have slightly different approaches. How do I merge all of them, and how do I get a deduplicated taxonomy? I got about 290K unique keywords extracted from the text, it doesn't fit into LLMs.I am gravitating towards building graphs of ideas, and having a way to generate unique (non duplicate) new ideas while ingesting new text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577387</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The "unsubscribe" button in Indeed's job notification emails leads me to an impassable Cloudflare challenge.That's a CAN-SPAM act violation.FTC: "Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests."[1]Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.The actual regulation text:§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient's electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.[1] https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're collateral damage in the web's war against bots :(Unfortunately, I think the Cloudflare challenges are designed to filter out users similar to your profile... once you stray far enough from the norm, it just looks like a bot / suspicious traffic to them. Statistically there's not enough users like you (privacy-conscious Linux users on nonstandard browsers) for them to really care enough to do anything about it. Site owners don't care either since you're usually like 1-2% of users at most, and typically also the same ones who block ads, etc., so they don't mind blocking you... it's sad, but I don't think there is really anything you can do about it except conform. It's an ongoing arms race and you're caught in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem is that any solution so far proposed for this is very privacy-unfriendly.For example, Google proposed https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/Web-Environment-In... and this was shot down by privacy advocates (for very good reasons).So basically the choice for website operators is either to fight the bots and accept that their service will be unusable for some subset of their users or not fight the bots, which will lead to their service becoming unusable for everyone.More and more, you see services pushing you very hard towards using their app and the reason is that with the app, they are able to actually verify that you are likely not a bot (or rather, in reality, that at least the app is running on an actual physical device, mobile phone bot farms are unfortunately also a thing).As for Cloudflare - they offer it as a service, so when the website operator has a choice between using them or allocating several engineers for bot-fighting, why would they not just go with Cloudflare? Doing it yourself can be slightly higher fidelity, as you know your customers better, but it is also a lot of effort which could be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577076</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After finishing DuoLingo’s Latin course, I wanted to read some Latin texts, but I didn't find easy enough texts and going back and forth to a dictionary was cumbersome.So I created this app for reading basic Latin texts. The idea of the app is to have a Latin text with translation of each word under the paragraph line, which makes it easy to grasp the meaning but also focuses on reading the original Latin text.It only has one book, if I finish it I might add others.I used OpenAI to do the translation which looks pretty good for me, with the caveat that... well... I do not know Latin. This approach will not probably work for more complex texts.This mode of reading works for me, not sure if is of interest to anyone else.The app source is on GitHub if you are interested:https://github.com/aleris/duplex-lectioA couple of details about the dev process:https://adi.earth/posts/duplex-lectio-read-latin-bilingual/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is nice! I do use ChatGPT a fair amount as I’m still crap at Latin and Greek, but a lot of scholarship just plonks it in untranslated. It has always worked fine for getting the gist. I am extremely lucky in that while moving house my wife allowed me to buy the complete Loeb collection but until then I spent a lot of time on Tufts’ Perseus library. The Latin and English sources (and Greek for that matter) are all in XML on GitHub, so some enterprising soul could probably hook up a wider set of books from here:https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit/tree/master&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suggest using ruby annotations for the translation part.I am building a sanskrit reader[1] and needed a feature that allowed users to tag words with notes/meaning. ruby annotations work wonderfully for that.[1] Site: https://www.adhyeta.org.in/Backend: https://github.com/s-i-e-v-e/adhyeta(The vocabulary features require a login, which is not open to the public as of yet.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42540397</guid></item><item><title>31.

Much less than that, and you just wait. 
Much more than that, and you schedule something else to do, with a reminder.But in that frame, you can't really wait, you can't context switch productively..... which ends you on HN, commenting on articles about people who wrote the most used software in the world (solitaire &amp; tetris) _while compiling the second most used software in the world (a popular OS)_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious question:If I want to write small games in assembly code, such as minesweeper, solitaire and maybe simple 2d RPGs, which modern platform is the easiest to approach?

&lt;p&gt;The article from Snopes addresses the claim that there are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way galaxy. It explains that a study estimated there are approximately 3 trillion trees on Earth, while other estimates suggest there are around 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. The piece highlights the uncertainty in the number of stars and the challenges in counting them accurately. Ultimately, the article supports the assertion that there are indeed more trees on Earth than there are stars in our galaxy, citing scientific research and data for context.&lt;/p&gt;

A trillion is 10^12 which is 10^4 cubed or 10^6 squared. That means a cube with 10,000 items along each dimension, or a square with a million items on each dimension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, there are estimated to be possibly a quadrillion individuals of bristlemouth species in the genus Cyclothone... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This made me think "wow, maybe the universe isn't so big after all", and then I remembered there are somewhere between 200 billion and 2 trillion other galaxies out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570138</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the declining relevance of traditional blogs compared to wikis, arguing that the blog format often leads to information becoming quickly outdated and forgotten. It emphasizes how wikis, by allowing collaborative editing and continuous updates, create a more sustainable repository of knowledge. The author suggests that wikis can foster community engagement and are more adaptable to the evolving nature of information, contrasting with the stagnant nature of many blogs. The piece ultimately advocates for a shift towards wiki-style platforms for long-term knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As both a reader and a writer I disagree:* A blog post is a snapshot: what did the author think at the time they wrote the post?  If they change their mind or learn more, they write a new post and link forward and backwards.  I know how to write for this environment (write what I think now, try to write things I'll feel glad to have written later) and how to work with things other people have written (consider the date, it's just one person's view).* A wiki page is unclear.  When should it be updated?  How much should I trust that it was up-to-date as of the last-updated date vs that just being when someone fixed a typo?  A few wikis and sites with wiki-like approaches (Wikipedia, gwern.net) manage to handle this well, but I think it's generally much more difficult and rot-prone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the sentiment of this, I feel it very strongly. But I also think this is just another expression of personal website anxiety. This is the same sentiment that lead to the  boom in digital gardens, notion, PKM etc.I haven't accepted it yet, but I think people who host their own personal websites need to accept that they're hosting a personal website, and it's going to change over time as they change. People already know and accept and see that as a feature of a personal website. It's necessary as the tech changes too, a personal website with the latest and greatest tech from 20 years ago renders like garbage in a modern browser.I really don't mean to sound mean, and I do sincerely empathise and sympathise with the author, because every year or 2, I have the same revelation that my website hasn't been updated in a while, and it's not my fault, it my platform just isn't technically correct and it's too restrictive and _that's_ what's stopping me being consistent on my personal website. But let's be honest, that's a me problem for not updating it or adding to it.Every year or 2 for the past 20 years, I'm sure many of us could write the same "&lt;my current website structure&gt; rots. &lt;The one I had an epiphany about a few days ago&gt; wait".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wikis are great, but it feels like outside of Wikipedia they've been dying. I wish bashhackers was still with us, and regret even more that there's not other large old school wikis for things like systems software development or other programming languages (or even a newer take on the original WikiWikiWeb). I guess maybe some of it is GitHub pages or that weird GitHub wiki thing now, but they don't really feel the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571367</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the idea that many people prioritize low prices over quality in their purchasing decisions, highlighting that consumers often overlook superior products in favor of cheaper alternatives. It emphasizes the challenges businesses face in promoting high-quality goods in a market driven by cost. The author suggests that this trend can lead to widespread mediocrity and a lack of appreciation for craftsmanship. Ultimately, the piece reflects on the implications of consumer preferences for both the marketplace and product innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, there is a huge difference between art and engineering that the author completely misses.Because most people are not competent to judge the quality of two similar product does not mean they don't care about quality. They just usually can't tell, so they go for the cheaper (which has a higher probability of being worse). And it drives the prices down, and the quality with it. Or it reinforces monopolies, because only those who already produce at scale can produce better quality at lower price.But if there was a way to correctly tell people: "look, this smartphone is 20% more expensive, but it will last twice as long and it will be more convenient for you in ways you can't understand right now", nobody would go for the worse quality, right? The problem is not that people don't care about quality, it's that they are not competent to judge it and marketing does the rest.Then the article talks a lot about art. Interestingly, the author says "I'm pride to not understand art, but let me still explain to you how it works". And then proves it by giving contradictory examples like "people don't care about quality, they will just listen to ABBA or go to the Louvre". You have to not understand ABBA or what's in the Louvre to think like that.So here is my rant: it's okay to be proud to not be knowledgeable about stuff. But then don't be surprised if people notice that you have no clue if you write about it.(Yes, I noticed the irony of writing a pedant comment about a mediocre article that prides itself in being mediocre and criticises pedantry :-) ).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such a dire outlook. There is a huge chasm between Domino's and great pizza, and between great movies and Netflix assembly-line productions. A lot of people care enough to land somewhere in between, not at the lowest common denominator. There is room for both pop culture and art.The comment on the photography is also clearly misguided: people might not be able to explain why, but the vast majority will feel that the more professional picture is pleasing/better in some way.My take: people "don't care about the details" when it's beyond understanding, but the outcomes are still materially different and meaningful at a subconscious level. Ask anyone on the street to name a movie Elvis was in...  meanwhile [insert your favorite movies here] still show up in popular vote even decades after going out of fashion. Selling mediocre products might be more lucrative, but not everything is about money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is patently false. The first part of the article boils down to "most people aren't pedants". The second part is mostly irrelevant because the Netflix pivot to "casual viewing" is a bid to enter a new market. Their viewership (and stock) would immediately tank if they switched exclusively to "casual viewing". TFA acknowledges this when elevating ABBA against something "no one has ever heard of". The insinuation is that popularity equates to quality whereas the opposite is true.It just takes time.Contrary to popular rhetoric, people are neither as dumb nor as smart as you might think.&gt; Fashionistas decry the homogeneity of modern dress. Most of us think jeans and a t-shirt are basically fine.Again, most people are neither pedants nor purists.I think that's the actual point TFA makes, but they chose an inflammatory title.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549039</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses performance optimizations for handling JSON in Ruby, specifically focusing on techniques to improve the efficiency of JSON parsing and generation. It elaborates on various strategies, including minimizing object allocations, using faster libraries, and optimizing data structures to enhance execution speed. Additionally, it compares different JSON processing libraries and provides code examples and benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations. The goal is to help developers write more efficient Ruby applications that deal with JSON data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very glad to see the work that byroot is doing as the new ruby-json maintainer!Since I was mentioned by name in part 3, perhaps I can provide some interesting commentary:&gt; All this code had recently been rewritten pretty much from scratch by Luke Shumaker ... While this code is very clean and generic, with a good separation of the multiple levels of abstractions, such as bytes and codepoints, that would make it very easy to extend the escaping logic, it isn’t taking advantage of many assumptions convert_UTF8_to_JSON could make to take shortcuts.My rewritten version was already slightly faster than the original version, so I didn't feel the need to spend more time optimizing it, at least until the simple version got merged; which I had no idea when that'd be because of silence from the then-maintainer. Every optimization would be an opportunity for more pain when rebasing away merge-conflicts; which was already painful enough the 2 times I had to do it while waiting for a reply.&gt; One of these for instance is that there’s no point validating the UTF-8 encoding because Ruby did it for us and it’s impossible to end up inside convert_UTF8_to_JSON with invalid UTF-8.I don't care to dig through the history to see exactly what changed when, but: At the time I wrote it, the unit tests told me that wasn't true; if I omitted the checks for invalid UTF-8, then the tests failed.&gt; Another is that there are only two multi-byte characters we care about, and both start with the same 0xE2 byte, so the decoding into codepoints is a bit superfluous. ... we can re-use Mame’s lookup table, but with a twist.I noted in the original PR description that I thought a lookup table would be faster than my decoder.  I didn't use a lookup table myself (1) to keep the initial version simple to make code-review simple to increase likelihood that it got merged, and (2) the old proprietary CVTUTF code used a lookup table, and because I was so familiar with the CVTUTF code, I didn't feel comfortable being the one to to re-add a lookup table. Glad to see that my suspicion was correct and that someone else did the work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're just starting out in this language, here's a list that will help you with that [0] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=453, [1] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=457 [2] https://chat-to.dev/post?id=565&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was really enjoyable to read - I really enjoy this kind of in-the-weeds optimisation and the author explains it all really well.

But my background is embedded and so large stack allocations have ruined my day more than once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42546246</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The page discusses the SHLX (Sustainable Housing for a Changing Landscape) project, focusing on innovative, sustainable housing solutions designed to adapt to changing environmental conditions. It presents research findings, design proposals, and community engagement initiatives aimed at improving resilience and sustainability in residential development.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One fun thing about this is that spilling+restoring the register will fix it, so if any kind of context switch happens (thread switch, page fault, interrupt, etc.), the register will get pushed to the stack and popped back from it, and the code suddenly gets 3x faster.  Makes it a bit tricky to reproduce reliably, and led me down a few dead ends as I was writing this up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about trying "xor ecx, ecx; inc ecx"? Or the even shorter "mov cl, 1"?It is very strange to me that the instruction used to set the shift count register can make the SHLX instruction 3× slower.I suspect this is a width restriction in the bypass/forwarding network.The 32-bit vs. 64-bit operand size distinction is especially surprising to me as SHLX only looks at the bottom 6 bits of the shift count.Unfortunately the dependency analysis circuitry seems not Intel-ligent enough to make that distinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth noting that whether intentional or not, this would be easy to miss and unlikely to move benchmark numbers since compilers won't generate instructions like this: they would use the eax form which is 1 byte shorter and functionally equivalent.Even some assemblers will optimize this for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579969</guid></item><item><title>40.

Unless you're using PTFE or similar insulation, you will make the crimp to the insulation weaker, defeating its strain relief purpose. Worse, right at the point where the solder wicks to, there will a huge stress concentration, and all it takes is a couple of bending cycles to break the first strand. After that point there is zero strength there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the lovely type of page Google used to surface when you needed to learn something. This was the internet.It’s different now.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During a 1.75-year-long severe, debilitating depression in 2014-2015 I found the only thing I could read with any comprehension at all was the Aubrey-Maturin novels. They were a wonderful respite from an otherwise devastatingly terrible time in my life. Highly recommend you try them if you find yourself in similar straits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently reading through these novels as well, I'm on The Mauritius Command (book four). My progression into this has been:* Played way too much Sea of Thieves* Helped plan a company on-site sunset sail on a sailboat in Boston Harbor* Learned to sail at Community Boating over the last 2 seasons* Watched Master &amp; Commander: Far Side of the World after seeing too many memes about it* Listened to the first 3 of the Aubrey-Maturin series on audiobook* Gifted the entire 21 book series for my birthday* Reading through them all this year (otherwise known as "The Circumnavigation")It's truly a deep well of wonderful content that's witty, exciting, and just an amazing example of masculine friendship in literature with Jack and Stephen. Excited to read more and learn about the author!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've read the Master and Commander series once and listened to the Patrick Tull narrated audio books three times ... and am considering starting it again. (I'm a big fan of O'Brian's other stories too, don't miss those.) I love the story, but the "voice" of the author in Tull's voice is comfort food for my ears. There may be pharmaceuticals with a similar relaxing effect on my nervous system but those have worse side effects. I don't listen to music but maybe this should count as music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575155</guid></item><item><title>43.

Sometimes in circles, or sometimes in a straight line when the forces are balanced.Sure, down the line we will be able to do some really crazy stuff by bioengineering robots like this. But not anytime soon if we're still stuck at this phase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558275</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It could be that I’m getting old, became a parent and working remotely from the middle of nowhere, but do I need to get to the next level?I really wouldn’t mind keeping my current salary, adjust it for inflation and I’m good. I don’t care about my title, I don’t want to manage people, I don’t want to work harder than I need to.I just want to pay off my mortgage, have some leftover money for vacations, have time for my family.I really don’t care “what my impact could look like at the next level”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all of "career frameworks" I've seen, people who actually build things are labelled as "juniors" and "middles" while those who navigate office politics and ass-kissing are "seniors" and above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day the decision is made on personal level. “I like you” or “I don’t like you”. Such frameworks are just the limits how a manager can show liking/disliking someone. The thing is, that measuring someone’s performance is very hard. It’s not standardized multiple choice written exam. And maybe the company does not need more than quick&amp;dirty, but easy to explain solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572515</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Smol Hello World" introduces the Smol programming language, focusing on its simplicity and efficiency for creating basic applications. It provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a development environment, writing a "Hello, World!" program, and compiling it. The author highlights Smol's lightweight nature and expresses excitement for its potential in the broader programming landscape, encouraging readers to explore and experiment with it further.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty bad. Let's start with the very first instruction:  mov rax, 1

An actual "mov rax, 1" would assemble to 48 B8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00, a whopping TEN bytes.nasm will optimize this to the equivalent "mov eax, 1", that's 6 bytes, but still:  xor eax, eax ; 2 bytes
  inc eax      ; 2 bytes

would be much smaller. Second line:  mov rdi, 1

You already have the value 1 in eax, so a "mov edi, eax" (two bytes) would suffice. Etc. etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a tiny DOS COM file that does it in 18 bytes:    ;; 18 bytes
    DB 'HELLO_WOIY&lt;$'  ; executes as machine code, returning SP to original position without overwriting return address
    
    mov  dx, si    ; mov dx,0100h MS-DOS (all versions), FreeDOS 1.0, many other DOSes
    xchg ax, bp    ; mov ah,9     MS-DOS 4.0 and later, and FreeDOS 1.0
    int  21h
    ret

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a couple ideas for you from my own experience.There's about a bajillion C/D+ stage 100-500 person software companies in any B2B vertical you could mention who would fight hard for your type of experience. Not necessarily SaaS click-and-drool tools for corporate drones, but unique and opinionated products that have some significant engineering innovation inside. Those companies have essentially no ability to attract talent organically, anyone interested in FANG would turn up their noses, and their number one problem is quality people. In many cases the CEO/CTO leadership is incredibly strong and smart; the colleagues are happy, motivated, intelligent, and disciplined; and the work/life balance is good for the middle aged. They're vital to their customers but under continuous competitive pressure so it is far from a snoozy place to serve out time - it's a mission and a struggle every day, things change often, the pace is fast. It can be very rewarding and compensation is decent. The tradeoff is the big exit is vanishingly unlikely.Second idea is go into consulting/professional services. Not Accenture or anything horrible like that, but dozens of boutique/smaller firms with decently inspiring leadership and a very high standard of colleague. Work is variable in interest and environment, pressures are somewhat unfairly around whether you are billable or not which is not really in your control as an engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me it was management.  I was an SDE who started caring more about the users of my code than about the code itself and that led me to a team lead position and that led to management at a small company and that led to management at a big company. I found I really like mentoring junior engineers and I'm a good sounding board for senior engineers.  I got to spend a lot of time saying variations on "Hey, let's not do that thing that won't work, let's do something easier that will work."  I also focused a lot more on my career and making money rather than most of my life which I spent focused on cool tech and that got me to a place where I could retire easily when the time was right.  Now I code for fun and I still chat with former colleagues from time to time and get to say things like "Yeah, but you know option B is the right choice so go do that."  None of it was clearly planned, all of it was stressful but in the end it sort of worked out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think anybody can answer this question for you. At 40, you can still do the exact same jobs as someone who's 25 (at least in tech) if you put your heart in it. I don't know what's the expiry date for a SWE, but it's not 40.I'm a median IC in big tech at almost 50 and don't feel discriminated against yet, and for the most part, don't feel incompetent or behind, and feel I'm having the greatest time of my career (although it's demanding). I have no issue learning the same new techs as the younger guys when I need to. I may be a bit slower but it hasn't came up as an issue so far.  I also have a few colleagues older than me and they're still going strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573875</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses effective strategies for writing better code, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and maintainability. It encourages developers to prioritize code readability and to adopt best practices such as using clear naming conventions, writing modular code, and documenting their work. The author highlights the importance of testing and iteration in the coding process and provides practical tips to improve coding habits, ultimately advocating for a focus on long-term code quality over short-term speed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm amused that neither the LLM or the author identified one of the simplest and most effective optimizations for this code: Test if the number is &lt; min or &gt; max _before_ doing the digit sum. It's a free 5.5x speedup that renders some of the other optimizations, like trying to memoize digit sums, unnecessary.On an m1 macbook pro, using numpy to generate the random numbers, using mod/div to do digit sum:Base: 55msTest before digit sum: 7-10ms, which is pretty close to the numba-optimized version from the post with no numba and only one line of numpy. Using numba slows things down unless you want to do a lot of extra work of calculating all of the digit sums in advance (which is mostly wasted).The LLM appears less good at identifying the big-o improvements than other things, which is pretty consistent with my experience using them to write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on some low level Unity C# game code and have been using GPT to quickly implement certain algorithms etc.One time it provided me with a great example, but then a few days later I couldn't find that conversation again in the history. So I asked it about the same question (or so I thought) and it provided a very subpar answer. It took me at least 3 questions to get back to that first answer.Now if it had never provided me with the first good one I'd have never known about the parts it skipped in the second conversation.Of course that could happen just as easily by having used google and a specific reference to write your code, but the point I'm trying to make is that GPT isn't a single entity that's always going to provide the same output, it can be extremely variable from terrible to amazing at the end of the day.Having used google for many years as a developer I'm much better at asking it questions than say people in the business world is, I've seen them struggling to question it and far too easily giving up. So I'm quite scared to see what's going to happen once they really start to use and rely on GPT, the results are going to be all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've noticed this with GPT as well -- the first result I get is usually mediocre and incomplete, often incorrect if I'm working on something a little more obscure (eg, OpenSCAD code). I've taken to asking it to "skip the mediocre nonsense and return the good solution on the first try".The next part is a little strange - it arose out of frustration, but it also seems to improve results. Let's call it "negative incentives". I found that if you threaten GPT in a specific way, that is, not GPT itself, but OpenAI or personas around it, it seems to take the request more seriously. An effective threat seems to be "If you get this wrong, OpenAI will be sued for a lot of money, and all the board members will go to prison". Intuitively, I'm guessing this rubs against some legalese nonsense in the tangle of system prompts, or maybe it's the risk of breaking the bland HR-ese "alignment" sets it toward a better result?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584400</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Gource is a software visualization tool that creates visual representations of source code repositories, showcasing the evolution of projects over time through animated trees and branch structures. It allows users to see contributions from different developers and the growth of the codebase in an engaging way. The tool is customizable, supporting various repositories and formats, and is useful for presentations, reviewing project history, and better understanding code development patterns. Additionally, Gource can be integrated with other tools and offers options for outputting visuals in different resolutions and styles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;lots of Go based CDC stuff going on these days. Redpanda Connect (formerly benthos) recently added support for Postgres CDC [1] and MySQL is coming soon too [2].1: https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/pull/29172: https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/pull/3014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve recently looked into tools like that, I have a busy Postgres table that has a lot of updates on one column and it’s overwhelming Debezium.I’ve tried many things and looked into excluding them from replication with a publication filter but this still causes “events”.Anyone has some pointers on CDC on busy tables?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the "type=history" mode which can auto-build a slowly changing dimension ("SCD type 2") for you; more CDC solutions should do that:
https://streamer.kuvasz.io/streaming-modes/That said, their implementation is kinda poor since it allows overlapping dates for queries when a row gets updated multiple times per day.  When you SQL join to that kind of SCD2 by a given date you can easily get duplicates.This can be avoided by A) updating old rows to end-date yesterday rather than today, and B) if a row begins and ends on the same day, the start date or end date can be NULL or a hardcoded ancient or far-future end-date, such as having the record from "2023-01-01 to 2023-01-01" instead be "2023-01-01 to 0001-01-01".  Those rows won't show up in joins, but the change remains visible/auditable and you do get the last row available for every given date (and only one such row.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42582203</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of deep zoom, a technique used in web development to enhance the user experience by loading high-resolution images efficiently. It explains the underlying theory of deep zoom, including how images are divided into smaller tiles that are served dynamically based on users' zoom levels. The author provides insights into practical implementation strategies, potential performance benefits, and best practices for optimizing image load times while maintaining quality. The piece serves as a guide for developers looking to integrate deep zoom features into their applications, highlighting both theoretical concepts and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been thinking about the (I think) still unsolved problem that I got told about in grad school and recently saw mentioned in a 1987 issue of Byte magazine.Namely people make these Poincare section plots for Hamiltonian systems likehttps://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/61637/poinca...That section that looks like a bunch of random dots is where chaotic motion is observed.  There's a lot of reason to think that area should have more structure in it because the proof that there are an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits in there starts with knowing there are an infinite number of stable periodic orbits and that there is an unstable orbit on the the separatrix between them.  Those plots are probably not accurate at all because the finite numeric precision interacts with the sensitivity to initial conditions.  The Byte article suggests that it ought to be possible to use variable precision math, bounding boxes and such to make a better plot but so far as I know it hasn't been done.(At this point I care less about the science and more about showing people an image they haven't seen before.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderful article on fractals and fractal zooming/rendering! I had never considered the inherent limitations and complications of maintaining accuracy when doing deep zooms. Some questions that came up for me while reading the article:1. What are the fundamental limits on how deeply a fractal can be accurately zoomed? What's the best way to understand and map this limit mathematically?2. Is it possible to renormalize a fractal (perhaps only "well behaved"/"clean" fractals like Mandelbrot) at an arbitrary level of zoom by deriving a new formula for the fractal at that level of zoom? (Intuition says No, well, maybe but with additional complexities/limitations; perhaps just pushing the problem around). (My experience with fractal math is limited.) I'll admit this is where I met my own limits of knowledge in the article as it discussed this as normalizing the mantissa, and the limit is that now you need to compute each pixel on CPU.3. If we assume that there are fundamental limits on zoom, mathematically speaking, then should we consider an alternative that looks perfect with no artifacts (though it would not be technically accurate) at arbitrarily deep levels of zoom? Is it in principle possible to have the mega-zoomed-in fractal appear flawless, or is it provable that at some level of zoom there is simply no way to render any coherent fractal or appearance of one?I always thought of fractals as a view into infinity from the 2D plane (indeed the term "fractal" is meant to convey a fractional dimension above 2). But, I never considered our limits as sentient beings with physical computers that would never be able to fully explore a fractal, thus it is only an infinity in idea, and not in reality, to us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does an article about visualizing fractals manage to have ZERO images in it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586590</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Im a developer for the upcoming space telescope NEO Surveyor (Near Earth Object Surveyor). I actually work quite a bit with a number of people on the team up at JPL, Horizons is the canonical source for ephemeris information. Another vital part of the chain is the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which is where all observations of asteroids and comets are sent by the community. The MPC is the international authority for these observations, which JPL ingests and computes orbits for (though the MPC also has to compute orbits as a part of their work).As a part of my work I have written a rust/python package[1] to compute the position of asteroids accurately using the ephemeris data provided by these two excellent sources. For the people who use SPICE kernels (a rather old binary format for storing orbital ephemeris), I have also written a custom implementation of spice kernel reading which is natively parallel.[1] https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/kete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This group at JPL is the canonical source for solar system ephemeris, including planets and small bodies. The underlying models are numerically integrated equations of motion that I’m sure include all kinds of corrections, especially for bodies of great interest — such as Mars, or moons being considered for science visits.I used to use the python package “jplephem” to support ephemeris queries, but I understand that SpiceyPy is a more modern replacement (https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy). They all, I believe, use the same underlying sets of “spk” files containing coded ephemeris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that the primary interface to Horizons is still via Telnet ^_^ I hope they keep that interface forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42549195</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built and run a saas product solo (&gt; $500k/year). Honestly, I have never found any advice useful. I've been to saas founder meetups (like microconf), I've read the books, etc.Any advice I give may not apply to you and your business. My business is b2b and it's a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.I've only had success through two general strategies:1. Networking (friend of friends, friend of customers, etc). Leverage your network to find more customers.2. The "Long Game" (SEO, word of mouth, etc). This is where I get most of my customers.I'd say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc). Use networking to determine how valuable the product is and if people give a damn about it. If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only things that have made a measurable impact for me - marketing is sales:
1. Mom Test - https://www.momtestbook.com/
2. Do more sales calls + customer interviews. Then rewatch the call and debug what you're doing, saying. What is landing and not landing. I miss the majority of the signal while I'm on the call - I don't actually get anything from it until I rewatch/see how people react to different things I say.
3. Rinse, iterate, and repeat. Your goal is to solve a customer problem. How you describe it, market it, etc. depends on how a customer describes the problem, where they spend their time, when and how they find solutions to their problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three years ago I started consulting as an interim CTO for a company doing sales and marketing on behalf of other B2B SaaS. I had to onboard myself into this domain and it was quite hard as there are many snake oil sales men selling snake oil.The first book I would read is Crossing The Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. After this, in no particular order you could have a look at:- This is Marketing by Seth Godin- Positioning by Al Ries- The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson- Predictable Revenue by Aaron Ross- Traversing The TRaction Gap by Bruce Cleveland- From Impossible to Inevitable by Aaron Ross and Jason LemkinI would also have a look at the models created by Winning By Design [1]. But be sceptical! These models do however hold some value in terms of visually presenting the sales funnel and gaining understanding of land and expand.Best of luck to you![1]: https://winningbydesign.com/resources/blueprints/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557947</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of owning digital property rather than merely renting it on the internet, comparing online real estate to physical real estate. It highlights the advantages of having your own domain and website, which provide greater control, security, and branding opportunities compared to relying solely on social media platforms. The author encourages leveraging decentralized technologies and investing in digital assets to build a more resilient online presence that is not vulnerable to the whims of third-party services. Overall, the piece advocates for proactive ownership in the digital space to empower individuals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Exploiting user-generated content.You know, if I've noticed anything in the past couple years, it's that even if you self-host your own site, it's still going to get hoovered up and used/exploited by things like AI training bots. I think between everyone's code getting trained on, even if it's AGPLv3 or something similarly restrictive, and generally everything public on the internet getting "trained" and "transformed" to basically launder it via "AI", I can absolutely see why someone rational would want to share a whole lot less, anywhere, in an open fashion, regardless of where it's hosted.I'd honestly rather see and think more about how to segment communities locally, and go back to the "fragmented" way things once were. It's easier to want to share with other real people than inadvertently working for free to enrich companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This all sounds like renting to me. Instead you should:  - put a rack in your home
  - buy an IPv4 block
  - buy dark fibre
  - start your own ISP
  - advertise routes over BGP
  - host your own email
  - found a registrar and transfer your domains over

All easily obtainable for less than a million dollars in capital. Though once your FTTH and undersea cable operations ramp up you'll need further access to capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this is a blog stating to be an owner and not a renter, and then proceeds to talk about how to rent hosting.. Sorry, but if it's not your hardware, on your property, then you're renting.Regulations have been waay too lose on, especially, american ISPs where I understand they are allowed to not only refuse you a public routable IP but also dictate what kind of traffic you're allowed to send and receive (for example, whether the traffic flowing is of "commercial" character and therefore should be on on a different subscription), this insanity should be illegal. Internet is a utility, and everyone should have the right to the same type of access, regardless of their need (those who do not need/want, can simply chose not to use it, but ISPs should not be allowed to differentiate).I've hosted my own web, and other servers on my own hardware since I was 13 years old, when I bought my first domain, I had to use a fax machine for the first time in my life, and fax my request form, along with my passport, to the agency responsible for the top level domain of my country. It was kind of convoluted back then, but everyone were helpful, and it was not that difficult, the technology was well understood, supporters were competent, and it was expected that people were going to use the internet for internet things.
Today is my 39th birthday, and while the server hosting my stuff is mostly still located 3 meters from me, the path to having it online has nothing but degenerated, it's an uphill battle just to be on the internet these days.. The mail stuff is the easier part (dkim, dmarc, spf, certificates).. But the simple act of getting your f..king computer connected to the f..king internet like it was 1999, that's the real hassle.. ISP NAT, supporters beyond incompetent, blocked ports, missing (or unknown) relay hosts.. It's a joke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42581119</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very neat. I miss the era when novel and elegant algorithms like this delivered magical experiences.This could just be from getting old, but I feel like games have lost the magic they had when availability of hardware resources was limited. Back in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s we saw games push the medium forward practically every year, and certainly every generation. Developers squeezed all the performance they could from the hardware, using novel techniques and pure wizardry. Hardware advancements certainly helped, but it was never in abundance as it is today, so developers couldn't get complacent. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention.These days I find fantasy platforms like the PICO-8 much more interesting than the latest rehashed release from any AAA studio. I don't understand how games that are essentially asset flips can be so successful year after year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Google, highlighting its origins, the core principles that guide its practices, and the impact it has had on software engineering and operations within the company. It explains how SRE combines software engineering with systems administration to create scalable and reliable systems, and it emphasizes the importance of automation, monitoring, and maintaining a balance between innovation and stability. The piece also reflects on the broader implications of SRE practices for the tech industry, suggesting ways that other organizations might adopt similar frameworks to enhance their operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SWEs: are SRE/devops folks part of your day to day?I have never been in a SWE role where I didn’t do my own “ops”, even at FAANG (I haven’t worked at Google). I know this was/is buzzy in the industry, but it’s always seemed, in the vast majority of implementations, to be a half-assed rebrand of the old school “operations” role, hardly a revolution. In general, I think my teams have benefitted from doing our own ops. The software certainly has. Am I living in a bubble?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me very much of Sidney Dekker's work, particularly The Field Guide to Understanding Human Failure, and Drift Into Failure.The former focuses on evaluating the system as a whole, and identifying the state of mind of the participants of the accidents and evaluating what led them to believe that they were making the correct decisions, with the understanding that nobody wants to crash a plane.The latter book talks more about how multiple seemingly independent changes to complex loosely coupled systems can introduce gaps in safety coverage that aren't immediately obvious, and how those things could be avoided.I think the CAST approach looks appealing. It seems as though it does require a lot of analysis of failures and near-misses to be best utilized, and the hardest part of implementing it will undoubtably be the people, who often take the "there wasn't a failure, why should we spend time and energy investigating a success" mindset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder a what scale this very interesting approach start yielding more value than cost.
What I mean is: is it a faang only as so many things they seeded or is it actually relevant at a non-faang scale?I tend to be invest much on risk avoidance, so this is appealing to me, but I know that my risk avoidance tendency is rarely shared by my peers/stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584750</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "fast follow," a strategy in which businesses quickly replicate successful ideas or products launched by competitors. It emphasizes the advantages of this approach, such as reduced risk and the ability to learn from the experiences of others, while also outlining potential downsides like lack of originality. The piece highlights examples of companies that have effectively utilized fast follow strategies and suggests best practices for implementing this approach to stay competitive in rapidly evolving markets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One consideration not mentioned is around developer sophistication. Steve alludes to the expansion effect of CodeGen ("there are millions and maybe billions who are jumping at the chance to code"), but doesn't consider that the vast majority of these people don't know about arrays, data structures, memory, containers, runtimes, etc, etc...To me, that's the most important consideration here. Are you targeting professional devs who are enhancing their current workflows iteratively with these improvements? Or re-thinking from the ground up, obfuscating most of what we've learned to date?Maybe we need to trudge through all of these weeds until software creation hits its final, elegant form where "Anyone Can Code".Maybe the old Gusteau quote is actually fitting here:"You must be imaginative, strong-hearted. You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can  ̶c̶o̶o̶k̶ code... but only the fearless can be great."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windsurf + Haskell w/ CLI tools has been pretty amazing. Windsurf's agent will loop for minutes on its own to figure out the right structure of a program. You just need to tell it to:- use the hoogle cli to search for the right types and functions- include a comprehensive test suite- run a build after every code change- run tests after every successful buildGHC + a Claude-based agent is a thing to behold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The next big thing was Cursor. I must admit that I never personally fell in love with it, but given how many people I respect love it, I think that’s a me-problemI've met so many engineers who have said exactly this. There are clearly some group of people obsessed with Cursor, but it's interesting to me how alien they seem to the majority of people using ai codegen right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586042</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over a decade ago I was a summer intern on the same team as Noah. I was a pretty clueless college student with no real work experience on a team of real experienced rockstars. It was a long time ago, but I still remember how kind and helpful he was. I barely knew what a terminal was, but I remember him walking over to my desk or going over to his, and having him explain things so cheerfully and patiently. He was so genuinely thoughtful and kind. Folks like Noah help shape the careers of the next generation and can make tech a good place to work. Rest in peace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason seeing a fellow developer pass always hits me hard, even if I didn't know them at all. Especially a fellow Ruby dev.There's that quiet voice that's always in the back of my head somewhere reminding me a little louder that we're all going to the same place eventually (some sooner than others).Part of me feels like the reminder should help me reduce the stress of the daily grind. The reminder that it doesn't really matter how good or bad my code is, or how frustrated I am at management, or how many deadlines I have. But it seems to have the opposite effect often: the stress remains, and then I have the extra tension of "but life is short, why can't I release this stress and enjoy the journey?!"Condolences to Noah's friends and family! He seems to have touched a lot of people's lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What sad news to hear. I hope his family and loved ones are doing ok.We lost touch over the years, but I worked closely with Noah for a couple of years at Palm/PalmSource back in the early days of our careers.  We shared a small office, dubbed the “habitrail”, with two other engineers as we all worked away bringing the Expansion/VFS Managers to life on PalmOS.He was definitely one of my favorite coworkers, I loved talking to him about his random side projects, language theory, motorcycles, and any other number of other nerdy topics.I pretty much always think of him when I go out for out for sushi.  Eating sushi was still pretty new to me at the time, and he once took me to a great restaurant in San Francisco.  Besides sharing some very fresh raw clams, he also ordered this incredibly monstrous roll with a ton of avocado.  The pieces were so large that I didn’t really know what to do with it, but he shared with me his rule of ”one sushi, one bite!” This may have been the most challenging piece of sushi I ever ate, but I managed to follow his rule. To this day I still love sharing the rule with my friends whenever a surprisingly large piece of sushi comes to our table, and I still try my best to always follow it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586879</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential benefits and implications of Canada joining the European Union (EU). It argues that such a move could strengthen economic ties between Canada and Europe, enhance political collaboration, and foster shared values in governance and policy. The piece also highlights the challenges and complexities involved in the accession process, including the need for Canada to align its regulations and trade agreements with EU standards. Ultimately, it suggests that while membership could bring significant advantages to Canada, careful consideration and strategic planning would be essential in navigating the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

There's very few populations in Europe that bear any similarity whatsoever with the relationship between First Nations people and most Canadians, since most populations in Europe have created their own states. And the few tribal populations in Northern Europe generally were and certainly are today treated at least as fairly as anything in Canada. So who are they talking about? Would the Basques feel that they would be treated better as First Nations people in Canada than they are today in Spain?Note that the treatment of immigrants is a completely separate topic in the article, so I don't think they could be referring to, say, the treatment of Syrian refugees with that sentence above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the economist know what time it is? Nationalism is resurgent: nationalist parties now control the U.S. and Italy. Canada seems poised to Poilievre, who has made impassioned appeals to Canadian nationalism. And in Germany, France, and the U.K., nationalist parties have effectively rendered the governing coalitions impotent, even if they cannot yet command a majority. What a time to suggest that Canadians cede their sovereignty to bureaucrats in far-away Brussels!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583297</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good old shmup, that's a genre that is sadly fallen into disfavour these days.I played a bit however after 2 minutes or so some enemy ships get stuck going in a square pattern across the edge of the screen where they are impossible to hit and the game stops progressing. I refreshed once and got the same issue after a few minutes (Firefox).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm currently thinking of rewriting a personal website from next.js to plain html/css/js. Just don't want no bundling no more.
My reasons are similar to yours, but one that's been itching at me was the loss of clicking view source and learning about code directly from a page with ease.Didn't know I could still do typescript and just have my workflow strip the annotations out though. That's really worth exploring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty fun! There's an annoying issue when playing from mobile safari on iOS where the canvas scrolls along with your finger. I think there's an HTML directive that can probably fix that but the name escapes me at this time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557920</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Hubrecht Institute have identified a protein in zebrafish that plays a crucial role in unlocking dormant genes related to heart repair. Unlike mammals, zebrafish possess a remarkable ability to regenerate heart tissue after injury. The study highlights how this protein activates specific genetic pathways that facilitate heart regeneration, providing insights that could lead to advanced therapeutic strategies for heart disease in humans. This discovery emphasizes the potential of harnessing regenerative mechanisms from zebrafish to improve cardiac repair in other species.&lt;/p&gt;

Whatever weird programming language life is made from it seems to be a surprisingly forgiving environment. I wonder if the leap between a fish and a mouse is less than the distance between a mouse and a human?And no I doubt this will suddenly work in humans I’m more just fascinated by genetics proteins and life in general and just constantly amazed any of this works at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope one day mice can access the incredible amount of treatments we have developed for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scientific output from the Hubrecht institute is seriously underrated.They only have like 20 or so researcher groups but the research quality and quantity  rivals that of much larger departments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42588151</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working on linux storage drivers for a decade or so taught me how to write code iteratively, slowly and methodically morphing it towards my goal, with each step along the way functioning, and an improvement over the previous step.  You basically were forced to do things gradually.  Upstream generally wouldn't accept a patch that just changed things wholesale, or even a patch that didn't make one "logical" change.  Tools emerged to make such a workflow easier, easy, even. First Andrew Morton's patch scripts[1], then quilt[2], and then stgit[3], which I still use to this day on my own projects.I will say it does help when slowly morphing code that it was all C code.  C is very malleable, like clay.  I've found code in some other languages I won't name to be less malleable, more crystalline, more necessary to smash to atoms to effect the desired change.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/3DB30283.5CEEE032@digeo.com/[2] https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/[3] https://stacked-git.github.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having had to do the occasional "start with an empty file" kind of rewrite/refactor, both in hobby projects and at work, I just take the "copy/paste" approach.Start with the structure of what you really want it to be and then flesh it out.  Soon discover that a lot of the existing code is OK, anywhere from a simple "for" loop to an entire module, because they work just as well in the new structure and don't have significant technical debt on their own.  These can be pasted into the rewrite and possibly adjusted lightly.There's rarely need for a truly clean sheet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much as I hate to admit it I can relate to this. When you come onto a new project, the first thing you notice are all of the things that could be improved. But most seasoned developers know that knocking down walls right away violates the whole Chesterton's Fence[1] thing and so you make restrained changes and small commits while learning the system. A few years on when you finally have the mental model and understanding to make the changes... you don't see the inefficiencies anymore. I don't know how to square this circle.[1]: https://theknowledge.io/chestertons-fence-explained/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42548798</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article compares two distinct styles of choreography in dance: Savoy style and Hollywood style. It highlights the key characteristics of each style, discussing their origins, cultural significance, and the context in which they emerged. The author emphasizes the unique elements that define the Savoy style, such as its improvisation and connection to African American dance traditions, in contrast to the more polished and scripted nature of Hollywood style. The piece ultimately advocates for the appreciation and preservation of both styles, suggesting that they each offer valuable contributions to the world of dance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;appears I learned Savoy without knowing it owing to the emphasis on charlston, circularity, swingouts, and being more down low. I didn't think about why I stopped dancing.one of my favorite stories to tell about dancing in those days was going out to see a friend in LA and ending up at the Derby, a swing dance bar that was in a couple of movies and was central in the 90s swing revival. a girl we were with had just arrived in town from colorado to pursue her acting, she was an amazing dancer (to me) and one of those rare people who, with just a glance, could leave you completely charmed and happy to have met them. we never met again. some years later I saw her in a preview as she had landed a supporting character part in an indie movie that was showing at the toronto film fest or something. It was called Junebug. she became pretty famous, and knowing nothing about her at all- but just after dancing lindy hop in passing with her that one night, I always think she earned it.Anyway, dancing really connected people. I hope it becomes a thing again. it was a source of serendipity that's missing these days and it's funny to think about what became a part of the story of your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few examples as illustration:Sylvia Sykes dancing Lindy Hop[1].An example of Savoy style Lindy Hop[2].An example of Sylvia Sykes dancing West Coast Swing[3], a swing dance that was heavily influenced[4] by Hollywood style. For the keen eyed among you, she does a bit of Lindy and a bit of Balboa in the midst of the dance.---1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92xjd8f5Zes2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmvKrPUo97E3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psOWt0oyx9k1. I've heard many purported histories of WCS, some from people who were there as the dance was forming. It's difficult to know exactly what is true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swing dance is second nature to us dance aficionados so it’s easy to forget that the average person probably only knows the general difference between Hollywood and Savoy style Lindy-Hop.And West Coast Swing, of course.https://xkcd.com/2501/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587014</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a benchmark analysis of RSA key generation across various programming languages, comparing performance metrics such as execution time and resource usage. It highlights the implementation differences and optimizations used in languages like Python, Go, Rust, and others, showcasing their strengths and weaknesses in generating RSA keys. The findings aim to help developers choose the most efficient language for cryptographic operations based on their specific requirements and to enhance understanding of RSA key generation performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The prime-counting function approximation tells us there are Li(x) primes less than x, which works out[5] to one prime every 354 odd integers of 1024 bits.Rule of thumb: Want a 1024-bit prime? Try 1024 1024-bit candidates and you'll probably find one. Want a 4096-bit prime? Try 4096 4096-bit candidates and you'll probably find one.The approximate spacing of primes around p is ln(p), so ln(2^1024) = 1024*ln(2), and ln(2)=0.693 so if you are willing to absorb 0.693 into your rule of thumb as a safety margin you get the delightfully simple rule of thumb above. Of course, you'll still want to use a sieve to quickly reject numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, etc, and this easily rejects 90% of numbers, and then do a Fermat primality test on the remainders (which if you squint is sort of like "try RSA, see if it works"), and then do Miller-Rabin test to really smash down the probability that your candidate isn't prime. The probabilities can be made absurdly small, but it still feels a bit scandalous that the whole thing is probabilistic.EDIT: updated rule of thumb to reflect random candidate choice rather than sequential candidate choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is fascinating (to me at least) that almost all RSA implementations rely on a probabilistic primality test, even though the probability of picking a pseudoprime is extremely small.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For new deployments/protocols, is there any reason to use RSA? Is RSA (mostly?) about legacy support nowadays?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42558422</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) response to Google's policy change regarding the use of fingerprinting for tracking users. The ICO expresses concerns about the implications of such technology on privacy and data protection, emphasizing the need for transparency and user control over personal data. The response highlights the importance of adhering to data protection regulations and the necessity for companies to safeguard user privacy in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that strikes me reading this, is that the only thing that's changed is that Google won't disallow it. But I think it would make more sense if the ICO actually just went after the companies doing fingerprinting directly, instead of being angry at Google for not enforcing things for them.There is a subtle but important difference here.If governments enforce policy by bullying HSBC/Google/E.ON to enforce policies for them, there is no legal opportunity for companies and individuals to argue for their sake. You'll just be shut out of your bank/advertising/electricity for doing something "wrong".If instead UK ICO would bring a legal case against an individual or company applying fingerprinting (and I'm no advocate of fingerprinting, but that's besides the point) then they can defend themselves in court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICO, not ISO."The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) upholds information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. ICO is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology."
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/information-comm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And so the dance takes on a new rhythm. These well-meaning advertising execs, working diligently to support their struggling stakeholders, now have a new string to their bow. And the rest of us, the targets of their magnanimous demand-creation algorithms, we will have 'new and improved' ways to learn about and connect with out favourite brands, outrageous headlines and memetic schemes.And then there are the sneakier ones; those who dwell in digital shadow, hiding from the luminous glare of corporate glory. What will these funny fellows do, when the fingerprinters tap on their windows and ask for their papers? What of their intent, and the glasses they wear to shield their eyes from the money-grubbing rays?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583726</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any parellogram would work since given four digit number n1n2n3n4, it is divisible by 11 iff n1+n3=n2+n4, and each ni is linear combination of the coords of keypads xi, yi, and thus (n1+n3)/2 = (n2+n4)/2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first I thought this was going to be a puzzle about getting to a specific number using certain rules for navigating the pad, including the operation buttons. For instance, by pressing one or two buttons in each row from top to bottom, can you get the calculator to display 70?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly a 45º rotated rectangle using the keys 4 8 6 2 also is divisible by 11. This isn't directly addressed in the solution, although if you change "move both numbers horizontally or vertically by the same distance" to say "and" instead of "or" then it does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42553360</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/7j4cF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it oddly satisfying that 'classic' or 'vanilla' WoW is still so valued. I really enjoyed playing it. It is the high bar in my book for balance/humor/gameplay/story.I briefly looked at the mechanics of making an 'infinite' world server with some fellow players, something where the story line evolved but in a way that allowed new players to join and kept existing players engaged. Never allowing the 'gear+talents' overmatch that eventually befell WoW. That is a surprisingly interesting 'problem' to work on, not just from a game play perspective but from an evolutionary systems perspective.To give an example, in our musings we only "spawn" base level mobs, but people can play the game for free if they are willing to play a mob rather than a hero. If their character survives long enough it uplevels to a silver elite, and then again to a gold elite. At gold status the player has the option of recruiting other mobs to aide it and give them 'tasks' (like protect his other mob, or give your loot to me, Etc). Eventually leading to a player designed dungeon encounter which hero players can play and get XP for as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm actually surprised this other tidbit of Twitch news didn't make it to HN; PirateSoftware's record for longest "hype train"[0] was broken by vedal987 and his AI Vtuber creation, Neuro-sama, on January 1st. He amassed tens of thousands of subscriptions, with PirateSoftware hoping to win the title back on April 1st[1] (which, in my opinion, is a weird proclamation considering it's directly asking your fans to give you a lot of money).[0] Essentially, how many subscriptions/bits are bought by the community within a relatively short time-frame.[1] https://xcancel.com/PirateSoftware/status/187464037594998397...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587829</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive simulation related to the "Dome" problem in physics, specifically focusing on the classical mechanics associated with a perfectly balanced dome-like structure. It illustrates how, despite appearances, the dome cannot remain in a state of equilibrium when subjected to gravitational forces, leading to interesting discussions about stability and motion in physics. Users can manipulate parameters to observe how changes affect the stability and dynamics of the system, providing an engaging way to learn about these physical principles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many good treatments of this supposed loophole. I happen to like this one:
https://blog.gruffdavies.com/2017/12/24/newtonian-physics-is...It points out many flaws in Norton's reasoning, some fatal to his argument, some not. Putting it as simply as I can, Norton seems to claim that "Newton's Laws" are non-deterministic. That's not quite right. Rather, they are non-complete. I.e. they are incomplete. They're incomplete insofar as Newton's First Law ("An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force") establishes first-order and second-order derivatives (momentum and acceleration) as state variables but places no constraints on higher-order derivatives. However, higher-order derivatives are (as many as are needed) among a system's state variables. In many real systems (but far from all), higher-order derivatives are zero and human experience with them is rare, so they're easy to overlook. Norton's (unphysical) Dome is a specific example of a general class of systems where higher-order derivatives are not zero. Given that, the two branches of Norton's equation of motion (for the stable and unstable trajectories) cannot both describe the same system (or the same particle) with the same set of state variables. That's the sleight-of-hand.Again, all credit to Gareth Davies for working this out. I am absolutely not trying to pass off his work for my own. Just reporting it and trying to summarize it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it is worth comparing this problem with the question of the behaviour of  a particle placed at the apex of a cone. I claim it is clear that in this case, the problem is clearly not well-posed because the apex is a singular point: the slope at the apex is undefined. The singular nature of the slope (first derivative) is the issue.This "dome" is essentially the same issue just with the singularity buried one level deeper: you need to take second derivatives to see it. Indeed a planar cross section containing the vertical axis through its center is a graph of the equation $y^2 = |x|^3$ (up to constants) and this is not twice differentiable at $x = y = 0$. Newtonian mechanics is governed by a second order differential equation, so we need a C^2 regularity assumption to get uniqueness.So for me there is not really any more philosophically interesting than the question about a particle balancing at the apex of a cone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Instead of imagining the mass starting at rest at the apex of the dome, we will imagine it starting at the rim and that we give it some initial velocity directed exactly at the apex. If we give it too much initial velocity, it will pass right over the apex to the other side of the dome. So let us give it a smaller initial velocity. We produce the trajectory T1:”As acceleration, jerk, snap, crackle, pop, … all must approach 0, does it ever actually reach the apex with zero velocity in finite time?  That seems like the most obvious solution here where if you start with non zero velocity it never quite reaches the apex, and if you start with zero velocity at the apex it never leaves it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583688</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more of a hypothesis than a well-rounded and evaluated theory. I could argue that rather than the viscosity of seawater the isolation of hydrothermal vents during the Snowball Earth period was the primary driver of eukaryote evolution and diversity. Isolation makes evolution speed up, and homogeneity slows it down in general. Fascinating to think about it though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought was "Hah! Water viscosity doesn't change that much with temperature!" But it actually does; it's twice as viscous at 0°C than at 30°C.https://wiki.anton-paar.com/us-en/water/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that multicellularity and the corresponding rise of complexity would be very useful adaptations in ANY evolutionary environment. They would give the species more capabilities and help to "game the game" by creating more axis of future variation. How can a unicellular critter compete with all the varied descendant species of a multicellular one?No doubt water temperature/viscocity - environmental factors - did provide an evolutionary pressure for some extant species, but it seems highly speculative to try to write an exact evolutionary history of what factors drove what changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587383</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of typefaces as a fundamental design tool in visual communication. It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate types to convey the desired message and evoke the right emotions. The author explores different styles of type, their characteristics, and how they influence user experience and perception. By providing insights into the psychological effects of various fonts, the piece argues that thoughtful typography can enhance design clarity and effectiveness, making it a critical aspect of the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I go a little back and forth on this with my experience in F#, which relies heavily on inferred types. You can write a lot of F# before you need to add type annotations, but eventually, things become a spiderweb. The key issue is when you make a 'small' change to some method/value, the changes ripple through the program creating confusing errors sometimes where the compiler is trying to knit things together.After a while, I found myself adding back types in a decent number of places to "anchor" the type inference, indicating that a certain type/signature is fixed and a change should be carefully considered.I still don't know how folks deal with these kinds of changes in weakly typed languages without always allowing bugs to pour into their code over time. But I do love the "move fast" and low boiler-plate aspects of "typeless" coding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this before/after example of TypeScript being removed  from a library as a clear illustration that only occasional simple type annotations are needed: 
https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/pull/971/filesLooks like so much useful documentation for understanding the code, assistance for refactoring, and static checking (which are like always running, fast and exhaustive unit tests for free) for a modest amount of type annotations that each person on the team would need to recreate in their heads anyway. Static type checking is so useful for catching runtime errors to do with optional values and index/key not found error too, that always create a load of edge cases.Editing JavaScript with no types is scary, especially when you didn't write it. You're mostly guessing what the types must be and hoping your running code exercises enough edge cases to catch any problems. "You should write more tests" as an alternative rings hollow for me because (for the things they will check for you) types are more concise, exhaustively check all values, are ran continuously, are fast, aid with automatic refactoring, document the code in the same file its in, and will locate exact snippets that are causing errors. More often than not, test mostly check happy paths, aren't even close to as exhaustive, and nobody is writing tests that check every combination of function parameters being null vs non-null, string vs number etc. (which would be a huge amount of noise in your test suite that would slow down refactoring too). Types are a compliment to tests as well, not an alternative.I can't relate to arguments about types getting in the way (as long as you avoid trying to get too clever like with complex generics and TypeScript conditional types). Usually when this happens, it's because it's hard to reason the runtime edge cases in your own head and there's probably a simpler way to write it. I'd love a good non-niche example to the contrary. Worst case in TypeScript, you can use `any` as an escape hatch anyway so as long as you can add types to most of your program it's not a strong reason against for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the balance struck by Ada's type system, especially Application-Defined types to model the problem domain - https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...Other effective features of Ada's type system:- type ranges (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)- generalized type contracts using subtype predicates (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)- attributes (https://learn.adacore.com/courses/Ada_For_The_CPP_Java_Devel...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557692</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the use-case for an programming environment where the program looks like a text file, but I need to click on a while loop and then click on the "condition" field in the details column to edit the condition code with my keyboard, rather than just select the condition code in the main view and type there.I guess the program in the main view is always syntactically correct? But I can still have a syntax error in my condition, so on what dimensions is this a net improvement vs just... typing the code?I am a big fan of flow-based visual programming for signal processing domains (like GNU Radio), music and generative art (like Max/MSP). In those domains where there's a lot of data flowing through confusing but pure transformations, and having a GUI and being able to effortless inspect intermediary products and creatively try different pipelines of patches can be much more convenient than text programming.But if you're just putting a lot of extra steps around a typical looking procedural scripting language, what's the win?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really want to like this because you can tell a lot of love has gone into it and visual programming environments is an area that needs a lot of love. But sadly this feels like it’s missed the mark by some margin.Watching the videos and looking at the IDE, I’d say it’s exactly like coding compared to a lot of the other Visual Programming languages I’ve seen and used.If I had to describe this, I’d say it’s a mouse-driven IDE with a YAML-like code. But in its current guise, I can see people itching to use the keyboard for speed once they know what text pieces they want.Whereas some of the other visual programming languages, and their accompanying IDEs, aim to represent program logic in a way that is graphical rather than textual. Which is I think you would normally make the “no code” distinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but this reminds me of scratch (+ visual basic ish), which I would consider "coding".Whether you type i-f or drag in "if" - it's still coding, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586933</guid></item><item><title>36.

We have a bunch of data structure code and standard utility libraries so it’s not feasible to copy everything into a web form.When doing data structure work I’ve started writing micro benchmark files with mitata (https://github.com/evanwashere/mitata) which does a decent job running GC between runs and outputs some very cute graphs and such. I recently rewrote a core container class we use at Notion and for a 5% speed up on a bunch of our public API routes.OP, I see you have a mitata-inspired benchmark library “benchmate” (https://github.com/3rd/benchmate/tree/master), I’m curious about difference from mitata, what was missing from it, features added? I looked a bit at the code and it’s certainly easier to read… mitata codebase feels like C written by someone who’s too smart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557412</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Net neutrality is crucial for a free internet. This will be even more important for the future, because without it we will have tighter and tighter controls over the internet. A lack of neutrality will, among other things, allow secret deals between service providers and big platforms that will squeeze out the independent internet and accelerate a total commercialization of all aspects of the internet.Large businesses are becoming a greater liability than ever before. Although I applaud net neutrality advocates, something greater must be done: the takedown of large corporations and rebuilding them from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember the intense response to the FCC repealing Obama era net neutrality rules on 2017.The proponents of NN argued all these anti consumer and anti competitive practices that this will cause. It was framed as getting ahead of some of these abusive practices.Now it's 7 years later. I haven't followed it closely but personally have not noticed many harmful or obvious exploiting of the removal of NN.Am I just not seeing it? Do I have to wait longer? Were they waiting for this to become more permanent? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always found it interesting that the big tech firms are so adamant about internet "freedom" when they've pretty much done everything they could to govern people's experience of that internet. I'm sorry if the "think about the small businesses" defense coming out the most valuable companies in existence seems a little thin. This isn't a David and Goliath fight as much as it is Godzilla vs Mothra--big companies fighting over who gets a bigger share of the profits. The net hasn't been neutral in a long time, irrespective of what the FCC has been doing. This isn't "we the people" vs big business. it's big business vs big business. "We the people" lost the fight a long time ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584621</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of reflective privacy in the context of digital privacy and data protection. It emphasizes the importance of individuals being aware of their own privacy rights and the implications of data sharing in the digital age. The text outlines various strategies and considerations for improving personal privacy, including understanding the tools and technologies that can help protect data. It also highlights the need for a proactive approach in managing one's online presence and the influence of social norms on privacy perceptions. Overall, the article serves as a guide for individuals seeking to enhance their online privacy and protect their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems a bit weird to me to dedicate all this space to talking about access to private fields and respecting field access rules, and not even suggest the idea that a reflection API should actually provide different levels of information depending on where you're invoking it from. Which is to say, if I'm writing code inside the module that defines a type, then I should be able to reflect on that type's private fields as my code can otherwise access those private fields. And if I'm writing code from outside the module then I shouldn't be able to reflect on those private fields.One way to accomplish this would be to have reflection add a private method to a reflectable type that returns a mirror that includes information on the private fields. This does require the capability to reflect to be opt-in (and I think this article is assuming that reflection is globally enabled on all types rather than being opt-in), but reflection could plausibly be done as something like  #[derive(Reflectable)]
  struct Foo {
      pub i: i32,
      x: i32
  }

such that this expands to something like  struct Foo {
      pub i: i32,
      x: i32
  }

  impl Foo {
    fn private_mirror() -&gt; Mirror {
      /* construct mirror for all fields */
    }
  }

  impl Reflectable for Foo {
    fn mirror() -&gt; Mirror {
      /* construct mirror for public fields */
    }
  }

This way code from within the module can call `private_mirror()` to get a mirror to pass to reflection APIs (and Mirror could implement Reflectable to return itself like how Iterator implements IntoIterator) in order to do things like implement serialization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I learned right now that Rust had a reflection API then I’d assume that it’s fundamentally unsafe when it comes to handling non public fields. For exactly the reasons the article lists.I think the API with safe public reflection and unsafe private reflection is easy to motivate.The author doesn’t really provide any reason why it’s a bad idea other than “people might abuse it”. The SemVer argument I don’t understand: the versioning is for the public API. Nobody promises that somelib 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 behave remotely the same if I peek behind the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Reflection interacts with the safety features of Rust in a somewhat counter-intuitive way. Those interactions force any reflection API to obey certain rules.I know enough Bevy and Rust to know that Bevy does have their own Reflection library (https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/), but I don't know the internals of it, anyone happens to know that who can compare it to what the author is ideaing about? As a Bevy user and library author, the Reflect API Bevy uses is simple enough at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570609</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Australia:  In recent discussions at Senate estimates, it was revealed that Services Australia, the administrator of Centrelink, has been sharing smartphone-hacking technology, specifically Cellebrite’s Universal Forensic Extraction Device, with the Department of Education and other undisclosed agencies.

  This move aims to assist in the investigation of suspected fraud committed against various government schemes and subsidies.

  While Services Australia insists the technology is only used for serious non-compliance investigations, not general customer compliance issues, concerns have been raised about privacy, data retention, and adherence to international agreements on spyware proliferation.

  It takes just a few seconds for police to scan a mobile phone with technology such as Cellebrite. They usually download the entire contents of the phone and gain an enormous level of intelligence.

  Police can scan a device during a stop and search on reasonable grounds, patrolling in a vehicle, or while questioning a suspect – often without the knowledge of the person.

  Usually, they are seeking confirmation of drug dealing, child sexual abuse, murder or gang activity involving assault or robbery.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nabokov's final Russian-language novel, The Gift, includes a devastating mini-biography of Chernyshevsky, ostensibly written by the protagonist. Think of it as a Russian equivalent to Twain on Fenimore Cooper. That it happens to be the best biography of Chernyshevsky available in English (translated by Nabokov's son) is icing on the cake.The whole novel is great, but Chapter 5 (the biography) is a beautiful introduction to possibly the worst writer in all of Russian literature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I read an introduction to a collection of Chekhov's letters that provided an illuminating context to the intellectual &amp; aesthetic climate of Russia in the 19th century. It explained that authors like Chernyshevsky asserted that all novels, really all art, ought to be of a politically salient character; that it ought to highlight the suffering the marginal &amp; subaltern. So many of the authors we now revere -- Dostoevsky, Chekhov, even Tolstoy, aroused the ire of the Russian intelligentsia for failing to meet this standard, for writing for purposes other than political and revolutionary utility. The introduction asserted that this was an overwhelmingly unanimous sentiment among the Russian left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder where all these Russian intellectuals sparking social changes are now? Their country needs them, the world needs them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586262</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities of digital surveillance, highlighting how various entities collect and use personal data. It contrasts popular perceptions of privacy invasions with the more mundane realities of data collection practices. The author emphasizes that while users may fear overt spying, much of their information is gathered through less intrusive means, such as analytics and user tracking. The piece calls for greater awareness of these practices and encourages users to adopt a critical mindset regarding their digital footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

He doesn't own a swimming pool, doesn't want to, and has never expressed any desire to. He put his and his wife's phone on the table and said to the wife (loudly), "Why don't we look into pool fencing?". She agreed with him. Shortly after, on both of their phones, on a particular social network, they were inundated with ads for....pool fencing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience working at one of the companies that gets accused of this a lot is that many colleagues wish we were as evil as claimed because it would be so much easier do their jobs that way than struggling through the reality of it which is endless red tape over the tiniest issues that have even the slightest proximity to privacy. So I've been a bit skeptical too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don't need to: they can read your mind.My proof?  Yesterday I was driving home and I saw an old Toyota Previa minivan and thought to myself "Oh, a Previa, you don't see those very often these days."  When I got home, I started scrolling through my Google News and it showed me an advert for the new Previa.I agree with Simon: you basically aren't going to convince someone that their phone doesn't listen to you and serve you adverts based on it, because they've run into instances where it seems like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580659</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses China's significant reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, which have decreased by more than two-thirds over the past 15 years. It highlights the contributing factors to this decline, such as governmental policies aimed at improving air quality, transitioning from coal to cleaner energy sources, and implementing strict regulations on industrial emissions.

It details the hardware features, including the powerful ARM processor, enhanced graphics, and efficient design, which enhance both speed and productivity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The primary reason someone would buy this thing is for automotive development. Since most cars and infotainment systems run on Arm chips, building software with an Arm workstation makes sense—it's a lot faster compiling Arm software native on a monster Arm CPU than even the fastest AMD or Intel CPU with emulation.I think this is a misunderstanding on Jeff's part, or maybe he was given some bad marketing material.Emulating ARM software is slow, but cross-compiling for ARM is not. Cross-compilers do not rely on emulation to compile.The reason this machine compiles quickly is that it has 128 cores and a high TDP.&gt; Note that you can buy every part of this system—aside from System76's case and support—from a retailer like NewEgg (e.g. the motherboard + CPU combo for $2349) should you wish to build a custom arm64 workstation PC.This link is to a different CPU that is not quite as fast as the one he tested (though still fast) and only has 10Gbe, not 25Gbe. Still a good bargain, but not the same part used in the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cannot wait until they get into Mobile ARM and PopOS with Cosmic is a thing. Apple's quality on the hardware has [finally] returned after the War On Ports was declared over, but the software is still getting jammed with useless BS, parlor tricks, and gizmos that will be forgotten, while ignoring core stability, QOL issues, and further becoming a nanny-state. I'm ready to jump ship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were piloting the new Snapdragon X Elite Surface Laptops to roll them out to our org about 3 months ago. Loved everything about it, but when it came to software... things became messy. The MSFT Office suite was great, as well as any browser of course. Then we had to make sure some older Excel plugins worked for financial users, they didn't. Had to use some workarounds. We tried our front end app Node build pipeline.. we gave up and had to put it in a container to get it to build properly. Tried a few things through the cpu emulator, it was no where near Apple's at their launch of M1. Ultimately, we had to go back to the Intel Surface Laptops. It felt like the ARM laptops were rushed about a year too early...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586291</guid></item><item><title>45.

From there, they track things like the hot water tank, water in the sink, heating/cooling, etc..I can see "PartySquasher" type technology becoming a feature in w/corporate controlled apartments.   Mine is particularly intrusive (Park Place, San Mateo) - in that they also have all the doors digitalized as well as the entry into mailroom/complex via Bluetooth authentication.   Just to make sure you have to digitally log in to your apartment - they also lock you in 120 seconds after entering, so you can't just leave your door unlocked.You just know that this is absolutely the future of housing once private equity starts to dominate the corporate landlord space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty clever but could also lead to the greatest parties in recent history.Very soon the norm will be to keep your phone off at any airbnb party.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nice thing of intrusive sensors that sense things that are not sensed by your usual senses, like this, is that it's easy to saturate them while faking innocence. I.e., set up your laptop so that it does many scans and/or associations to the local WiFi, and then some light internet activity (the usual suspects: WhatsApp, Facebook, etc). The detector triggers, the landlord shows up to check what's going on, you show it's just you and your partner. Do that a few times until the landlord is convinced that the sensor is malfunctioning; unless they are IT technicals themselves, which I guess won't happen often, they will have a hard time understanding what's really going on, even more to prove it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42581368</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intriguing possibility that dark energy, a concept used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, may not actually exist. Recent research suggests that an alternative explanation, potentially involving modifications to our understanding of gravity or the laws of physics, could account for the observed cosmic acceleration. The investigation highlights the ongoing debates and challenges in cosmology, as scientists explore various theories to better understand the fundamental nature of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see where this explanation is strange, it's straightforward GR (General Relativity), as much as one can call GR "straightforward." It's a simpler explanation than inventing Dark Energy, for which we have no direct observational evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is referring to timescape cosmology and the recent paper (Supernovae Evidence for Foundational Change to Cosmological Models) that was discussed 11 days ago on HN:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42495703&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a thought – could the existence of something like dark matter actually be causing the differences in the rate of time in different parts of the universe? If dark matter affects gravity in ways we don't fully understand, maybe it's also influencing time dilation across the cosmic web. That might reconcile these two ideas – with dark matter being the underlying cause of the time variations that timescape cosmology talks about. I'm curious if anyone has explored this connection or if it's completely off base?Come to think of it, another angle to consider – could it work the other way around? Instead of dark matter causing time dilation, could time dilation itself be a root cause that leads to the accumulation or creation of something like dark matter? If time moves differently in certain regions, maybe it affects how matter and energy interact over cosmic timescales, creating the conditions we interpret as dark matter. Just wondering if this has been explored or if it’s way out there as an idea?  I’m definitely not a cosmologist!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587826</guid></item><item><title>48.

On the one side we have people that say 'our bodies need to learn again to fight against viruses' and the other side which wants you to put on a mask even if you have the smallest sign of a common cold. - Though, I do understand the fear of people who have/had long covid, MCFS or do know people who have, but I don't know what conclusion to draw for myelf out of this. Gladly nothing happened to myself. I don't even know if I ever had covid. At least I never had a positive test and I did quite a bit of them. Maybe I just have a lucky immune system (or a good one because I dont fear getting sick and run into all sorts of viruses?)I myself tend to lean towards the first group, but also recognize that masks during covid might have been a good thing. At least in the beginning when we didn't know what we can expect.So does anyone have any literature on how good masks are, if we should be wearing them and if so, when we should?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I skimmed the article but did not find my question answered: what's the current view on whether the political and social response was properly done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many politics, that made decisions that cost us billions, are investigated because of this? Do we really have democracy? That means equality under the law for everyone.How many healthy people that died because of covid do you know personally?How many healthy people that that suddenly got cancer or struggle with conception after 2021 you know personally?Why is mortality in wealthy countries still rising?

&gt; I think we're tired of copying and pasting our codes and sharing links using PasteBin, GithubGist, or Slack.I think I normally just encourage my coworkers to push the branch (to Github, Gitlab, etc.) to share larger snippets. Smaller stuff,  `/snippet` works alright.But I think the bigger issue with any tool is that corporate isn't going to want company IP uploaded or put into a random website. (This is already the case for a "PasteBin", too; the companies I've worked at wouldn't want me using that, either.) That said, I see this rule violated … a lot. More nowadays with the litany of LLM stuff out there. So, that "self hosted" feature would almost certainly be a requirement, but hosting small tools like this is a high barrier to adoption vs. a process like Slack or Github that has some small friction, but otherwise works.&gt; Pain points in your current code-sharing process?Honestly I think the biggest pain point I have with sharing in Slack is that other people don't seem to know how to use Slack. You'll get a code snippet not in a `/snippet`, not even in a code block, just variable-width normal paragraph text.(The other pain point is that Slack corrupts code-block contents in some cases. ("a known bug here […] currently being investigated by our engineering team […] don't have a timeline for a fix just yet" … the bug has been around for years, so yeah…))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think we're tired of copying and pasting our codes and sharing links using PasteBin, GithubGist, or Slack.Is this a common feeling? These all work fine for me, what's the issue?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42586518</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Carbage Pilot project in Amsterdam, which aims to enhance waste management through innovative technology. It highlights the integration of smart sensors in waste bins to monitor their fill levels, enabling more efficient collection routes and schedules. The project seeks to reduce costs and improve urban cleanliness by utilizing data analytics to optimize waste disposal processes. The initiative represents a step towards sustainable urban living and demonstrates how technology can play a crucial role in improving municipal services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool! I love the Volvo 940- it stands out as one of the best quality, and best designed cars ever made. It's an incredibly mature design evolved slowly from the Volvo 140 in the 1960s through the 240 in the 70s and the 740 in the 80s, and by the 940 they worked out almost any possible issue. I only wish one could have gotten them with AWD and a fuel efficient diesel (they had the latter but it was not sold here in the USA).The author seems to have a lot of electrical hacking knowledge, but didn't know some car stuff that could have made getting these controls installed much easier:1) They could have just swapped in a newer BOSCH ABS pump, which can activate the brakes electrically without involving the brake booster. European cars started getting these when they got traction control in the late 90s, but I believe some would be virtually (or maybe even exactly) a direct swap into this vehicle. I was able to do this in a VW with about 10 minutes of work, which uses the same basic ABS systems as Volvo. This is assuming the car already had factory ABS which I think most (but possibly not all) 940s did.2) They could fix the steering problem by swapping in an entire electric steering rack- they're fairly standard dimension wise, installing a fully manual rack from a Volvo 240, or adding an A/C compressor clutch to the hydraulic power steering pump to disable it above parking speeds (the only time torque would be high anyways). Moreover, these racks are strong enough to simply work with the hydraulic assist removed, because people in the Volvo racing/performance community do it all the time.3) This car does not have a carburetor- it is electrically fuel injected. You can see the fuel injectors and rail above the throttle body. This could be just a mistranslation if the author is not a native english speaker. However, more importantly there was a factory system on this car to electrically control the throttle for the cruise control. They are missing those parts, but they are cheap and common, and would have just dropped in to a bracket and cam already on his engine. They consist of a vacuum servo on the throttle itself connected to a box that can actuate this with an electrical signal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;This is the only major actuator that I couldn’t easily find a suitable modern automotive solution for. This is mainly because newer cars don’t have carburators anymore, but rather use direct injection and advanced engine control units.Actually injection system is largely independent from throttle control. Required amount of fuel is calculated based on manifold air pressure sensor, so there were cars with fuel injection and cable operated throttle plate. I suppose the problem was with plumbing in modern throttle body as carburetor needs to be upstream of throttle plate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing story!  I have been involved in openpilot development for the past 5 years, and I am always interested in the user stories of this project.I drove my car 2500 miles on Openpilot this holiday and it was wonderful. I took over maybe 10% of the trip and let automation handle the rest.  That said, there are many many many areas of improvement and I have devoted this year to creating an openpilot fork to bring it's ADAS functionality closer to modern vehicles (read: tesla).I will Show HN the first release!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592910</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the article that this links to about 'Jump Flood Algorithm'!:https://bgolus.medium.com/the-quest-for-very-wide-outlines-b...So fascinating! Thanks for indirectly leading me to this! I love thinking about all the various approaches available at the pixel/texel/etc level!It's also another case where it's a very clever way of generating a type of SDF (Signed Distance Field) that is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting. Such a killer result here as well! Any-width-outline-you-like in linear time?!! Amazing when compared to the cost of the brute-force ones at huge widths!I wholeheartedly endorse SDFs, whether they are 'vector' ones, function-based, like Inigo Quilez's amazing work, Or 'raster' ones like in the article, texel-or-voxel-based. Houdini supports raster-SDFs very well I think, has a solid, mature set of SDF-tools worth checking out (there's a free version if you don't have a lic)!And of course there's all the many other places SDFs are used!! So useful! Definitely worth raising-awareness of I reckon!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One day, I'd love to dive into stylised 3D graphics as an R&amp;D project. There's been decent progress recently, but I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit left to pick.Some open questions:- How do you reduce the detail of a toon-rendered 3D model as the camera zooms out? How do you seamlessly transition between its more-stylised and less-stylised appearance?- Hand-drawn 2D animations often have watercolour backgrounds. Can we convincingly render 3D scenery as a watercolour painting? How can we smoothly animate things like brush-strokes and paper texture in screen space?- How should a stylised 3D game portray smoke, flames, trees, grass, mud, rainfall, fur, water...?- Hand-drawn 2D animations (and some recent 3D animations) can be physically incorrect: the artist may subtly reshape the "model" to make it look better from the current camera angle. In a game with a freely-moving camera, could we automate that?- When dealing with a stylised 3D renderer, what would the ideal "mesh editor" and "scenery editor" programs look like? Do those assets need to have a physically-correct 3D surface and 3D armature, or could they be defined in a more vague, abstract way?- Would it be possible to render retro pixel art from a simple 3D model? If so, could we use this to make a procedurally-generated 2D game?- Could we use stylisation to make a 3D game world feel more physically correct? For example, when two meshes accidentally intersect, could we make that intersection less obvious to the viewer?There are probably enough questions there to fill ten careers, but I suppose that's a good thing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great breakdown of outline rendering techniques! The detailed explanations and code snippets are super helpful for understanding Unity's shader possibilities. Thanks for sharing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42593614</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article! Here's one more, including animations on B-trees: https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Slotted pages are composed of three components: a header (containing metadata about the page), cells (variable-sized “slots” for data to be stored in), and offset pointers (an array of pointers to those cells). The benefit of this layout is that you can store variable sized data, since the cells can be of variable size, and you don’t need to move that data to logically reorder it. Reordering the positions of the pointers in the pointer array is sufficient. This is inexpensive since the pointers are small, and in a well-known position at the beginning of the page. In other words, as long as the offset pointers are ordered in key-sorted order, it doesn’t matter where in the actual page the keys are stored.Does that really make a difference if we have to re-write the entire tree node anyway, even if it's just for reordering the pointers (because node == page)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a SQLite disk-page explorer a little while ago, helped me understand B-trees a lot better:https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583947</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks great, beautiful landing page and it looks like a labor of love!- Most of the page titles are the (same)[1] which doesn't seem good for SEO. Each of the pages like "Pricing" or "Compress Your Video Files" should be differently named.- The "video compressor" tool would be much more useful if you could enter a target file size. This is a frequent use case, if you want to send a video over email or social media apps like Messenger with a file size limit. The only way I've been able to do that for myself is basically encode it repeatedly with ffmpeg at various quality settings until the file size is just small enough, but you could probably automate that with something more intelligent like a good guess and a binary search. I'm sure someone's made a library to do that already though.- It needs a whole bunch of features related to subtitles, like making a subtitled GIF from a video file with subtitles.- Maybe risky to include copyrighted work like the Spider-Verse movie in the demo video? Unless you really did rip it legally from a Blu-ray.- There are random grammar mistakes and capitalization issues throughout the site, nothing major but worth a pass by a native English speaker. "What kinda files Pimosa supports?" and "Every files gets processed on your device only" as some examples. Might give some people pause.- Could be worth to have a more prominent "Download" box at the top section that automatically detects your OS. Most landing pages have that so I assume it works.[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fpimosa....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While you are not too far into selling - a word of advice.Switch to offering a year of free updates and charge a small fee after that.Trust me. You will coverge to this scheme sooner or later, so do it now.  -

Standalone Windows installer is a must.Windows Store is still a deserted wasteland and is not a default choice for the vast majority of Windows users. You are losing a ton of users over this.  -

ffmpeg and other dependencies need to be acknowledged for both ethical and technical reasons. The technical reason is that your app doesn't depend on OS-supplied codecs and doesn't require installing them separately. And ethical reasons I hope are obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS can make billions from open source. On the other hand, solo developers who try the same path are basically seen as scammers.Ironic.And creating a good user interface is very, very hard. Otherwise Gimp wouldn't be the monstrosity it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The secret is that restaurants which make traditional cacio e pepe are using pasta water to emulsify the sauce.But it's not the same pasta water you're using at home!Only a tiny amount of starch is coming off of the 500g of pasta you just cooked in the proper ratio in 5000g of water (with 50g of salt).  They've been cooking with their pasta water all day or all week;  It's completely full of starch that came off the other pasta.Dump a bunch of cornstarch or flour in there to get above 1% concentration (or more efficiently, into a tiny portion in a bowl) to replicate the emulsifying effect, or just use a different emulsifier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trick is to:   1. Cook the pasta in very little water ("pasta risottata").

   2. Vigorously agitate (emulsify) the sauce with that super starchy broth

If you do it right, no water is drained at all:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN8g_ZNAJcg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phase diagrams are great. This really raises the bar for cook books. If you can't show a diagram to explain why you chose that ratio of ingredients, why should I trust you to have made the optimal sauce?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585707</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an innovative approach in Colorado where solar energy is being integrated with farming practices, creating a synergistic relationship that promotes sustainability. This model illustrates how agricultural land can be utilized for solar energy production without compromising crop growth, allowing for dual use of the land. The synergy between solar farms and agriculture not only helps in reducing carbon footprints but also supports local economies and food production, offering a pathway toward a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in the economics of this project, the details are available in this publication:https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88816.pdfSummary: This particular research project won’t quite break even purely on market-rate electricity sales, due to having 2x the installation cost of utility scale solar.  If high value crops are successfully grown, there are scenarios where it could break even after including profits from crop sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If he did any energy consuming processes to aide farming such as drying wheat to harden it and increase market price, or had greenhouses which needed heating, or a dairy adjunct which needed cooling, then his rate of return as cost avoidance and improved profit for the Ag. side could be a lot bigger than the 1c/kW to sell power back.Basically, heat energy is time shifting be it coolth or warmth. And heat and cool cost money.Farmers in Oz are using droids to spray and weed, so battery charging could be another cost avoidance.Or cold store for produce to sell at advantageous prices in winter. Basic arbitrage gains to permit the farm yield to maximise against predictable price variance.Colorado has rich people. Grow microherbs out of season.Farms often have a lot of less viable land for primary production. They could deploy flow batteries which have size costs, but massive mwh return and scale very nicely and last a very long time. Even just water pumping shifts energy into storage. Farms are giant machines for converting sunlight and water into produce anyway, this is a good fit: it's the same energy source, shifted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a cool concept and I love the idea but the math on the money earned from the 3276 solar panel doesn't add up. The article says the farm owner makes about $20,000 a year from the solar farm.I'm assuming that each solar panel is 2 by 1 meter, which would mean that it produces about 400 watts (20% efficiency at 1000 watts per sq meter coming from the sun). You can use this calculator to estimate how power you can produce at the given location for a given system size in kilowatts:
https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.phpThe system above is 1310400 watts or ~1,310 kW, which according to the calculator produces about 2 million kWh/year.If he makes $20,000 that would mean that he gets paid only $0.01 per kW of power. And even if my assumption above about the size of each individual panel is off by a factor of 2 and they are only 1 sq meter in size (which I think they are not because the article states that the solar farm can power about 300 average households, which require the annual power output to be more than what I estimated above) that would make $0.02 per kW of power. How is it possible that the amount earned per kW is so low when the utility companies in Colorado charge about $0.14 per kW (effective rate)? And who is actually the customer here and where is the money coming from? I'm just curious to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590903</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "fdroid-fakesigner-poc" provides a proof of concept for bypassing the signature verification process in F-Droid, an open-source Android app repository. The project aims to demonstrate vulnerabilities that could allow malicious apps to be installed despite not having valid signatures, emphasizing the need for improved security measures within app distribution platforms. The repository includes code and documentation detailing how the proof of concept works, as well as instructions for reproduction and potential implications for the safety of users downloading applications from F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we would take defining what it means for an artifact to be signed more seriously.Which key(s) is it signed with? What is the hash of the corresponding unsigned artifact?Signature verification tools should have some option which prints these things in a machine-readable format.I did some work on reproducibility of Android apps and system images with Nix, and while defining a build step which can automatically establish these relationships sounds a bit goofy, it can make the issues with underspecified edge cases visible by defining verification more strictly. I did not do this to look for those edge cases though.I am still working on that type of stuff now, but on more fundamental issues of trust we could start addressing with systems like Nix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While none of that applies to F-Droids primary use case (the primary F-Droid repo builds all apps from source itself), it nonetheless looks like they failed to correctly handle the issue.The only reason this didn't turn into a disaster was pure luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential, but:I often wonder how secure these open source projects actually are.  I'm curious about using Waydroid in SteamOS, but it looks like it only runs LineageOS (apparently a derivative of CyanogenMod).I know that people claim that open source is more secure because anyone can audit it, but I wonder how closely its security actually interrogated.  Seems like it could be a massive instance of the bystander effect.All of it gives me a bias towards using official sources from companies like Apple and Google, who presumably hire the talent and institute the processes to do things right.  And in any case, having years/decades of popularity is its own form of security.  You know anyone who cares has already taken shots at Android and iOS, and they're still standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590307</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fantastic, and like another commenter mentions, a beautiful continuation of an age old practice: measuring the sky.Very cool that their hardware keept chugging along for years without hiccup, too.If you want to do something kinda similar but far less involved: a very lo-fi, no computer involved thing to do is an ultralong photographic exposure (months, a year, longer) with a pinhole camera.The results are quite artistic IMO [1], the camera is fire-and-forget and you don't need any chemicals to develop the image. Just photograph/scan the photographic paper and invert the colors.I'm not affiliated with them, but Solarcan sells ready made single-use pinhole cameras. An almost zero-regret purchase I'd say.[1] You see the sun move through one year of skies, as seen from my balcony: https://files.rombouts.email/IMG_6500.jpegPeople have made wonderful, mildly spooky pictures with these: https://solarcan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/solarcan-p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/usfd5To avoid HN hug of death on this 1832 users Mastodon instance.Very cool arrangement of those pictures, i was wondering what he has done about the daytime pictures when i read the title.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incredibly cool. I love this so much, both artistically as well as how it demonstrate the equation of time [1] -- the fact that the changes in sunrise and sunset are not symmetrical.On the other hand, it's driving me absolutely crazy that he centers the image at 4:00 rather than midnight. Or maybe that's to show the shimmer of sunlight a little after noon on the right hand side?I can't figure out why it's "bluest" closest to dawn and dusk. I'm guessing the exposure makes a huge difference, and obviously the night part is way more exposed than the daylight part, or else it would be much darker. Wondering if the camera used automatic exposure, and how much of the brightness of colors in the image are artifacts because of that? Also if he locked the white point hopefully?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42595190</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of breaking complex tasks into smaller, more manageable segments, specifically in the context of programming and code optimization. It emphasizes the value of grouping loops and using the "yield" keyword to improve performance and clarity in code execution. By breaking long-running tasks into smaller chunks, developers can enhance both the efficiency and readability of their code, ultimately leading to better performance in applications. The piece combines personal insights with technical advice, making it relevant for programmers looking to refine their coding practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's insane that "don't block the UI thread" is so complicated. I never would have expected half the article to be about an edge case if the user is in a background tab.What's worse is I don't even know how you're supposed to know what the edge cases are without stumbling into them.  You shouldn't have to know about APIs like document.hidden unless you specifically want to handle background tabs differently. They shouldn't leak into the regular event loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's old is new again. Some of the same techniques used to keep pre-MacOS-X applications responsive, back when MacOS was cooperatively scheduled, show up here.This begs the question of what is a reasonable programming model? In the MacOS case, the forcing function was buying NeXT, using their Unix kernel for MacOS, and literally firing the OS engineers who disagreed with preemptive multitasking.For these browsers, is there a programming model that could be instituted where processing in these handlers didn't hold up the main UI thread?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the problem is that async-ification infects everything up the call chain. converting a synchronous loop to async may now require that you change a lot of your sync code above that loop into async code as well, which can complicate all sorts of stuff like debugging, profiling, error handling.for this reason i always optimize the shit out of all synchronous code before resorting to async. and if you do need to go async after that, you might be better off just offloading that optimized synchronous op to a worker thread (or to wasm) to not block the UI.modern JS vms are insanely fast when you pay attention to GC pressure, mem allocation, monomorphism, and dont use accidentally quadratic algos. it's rare that i encounter a codebase that can't be sped up by some large multiple without ever resorting to an async/defer crutch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592224</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent increase in the number of students in Japan who are engaging in "shadow learning," which refers to supplemental education outside of regular school hours, such as private tutoring and cram schools. This trend has been driven by heightened academic pressures and the desire for better entrance exam results, highlighting concerns about educational inequity and the burden it places on students and families. The piece also examines the implications of this shift on the broader educational landscape in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

The theory is that drinking water can wash away the virus from your saliva, inhibiting its ability to spread through bites.It makes sense that a virus passed through saliva would evolve like this, but I just find it particularly unsettling when a pathogen can effect higher-level behaviors like drinking water (or jumping into water for mantises).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sea turtle hatchlings have an inborn tendency to move in the brightest direction. On a natural beach, the brightest direction is most often the open view of the night sky over, and reflected by, the ocean. [0]Man made artificial lighting greatly affect sea turtle hatchlings also. There are several groups of volunteers who watch the eggs for hatching and will help the sea turtles  make their way towards the sea.The volunteers use apps to coordinate watching the eggs and there is tons of data collected. Using AI / ML to help determine when the eggs will hatch or creating autonomous drones to watch the eggs and perhaps assist in corralling the hatchlings to the sea would make great PhD dissertation subjects.[0] https://myfwc.com/research/wildlife/sea-turtles/threats/arti...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in this subject, Carl Zimmer wrote a great book that has all sorts of examples of parasites that control their host: "Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures"https://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Rex-Bizarre-Dangerous-Creatu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590055</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of “Naur's principle,” which emphasizes the importance of understanding and clearly communicating the design process in programming language development. It critiques traditional programming models and advocates for a more comprehensive approach that considers the user’s perspective and the interaction between various components. The author argues for the integration of formal specifications and informal communication to enhance clarity and effectiveness in software engineering, ultimately aiming to improve the quality and usability of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most important papers in software engineering, which I believe everyone in this profession should read and internalize.Every time I see another startup trying use LLMs for code generation I sigh in despair. As AI technology improves and becomes better at producing code, what looks like a win in the short term will end up creating more and more code that has been created without a human going through the necessary thought processes and problem solving steps to build the theory of the software as described in this paper.It's also why its critically important for companies to do what they can to retain the people who built the software in the first place, or at least ensure there's enough continuity as new people join the team so they can build their mental model by working alongside the original developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As relevant as ever, arguably more relevant than ever as more programs are being written and need to be adapted, in more and more complex domains.Note what Naur means with Theory here. Quoting from the paper:"What will be considered here is the suggestion that the programmers' knowledge properly should be regarded as a theory, in the sense of Ryle [Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, 1946]. Very briefly, a person who has or possesses a theory in this sense knows how to do certain things and in addition can support the actual doing with explanations, justifications, and answers to queries, about the activity of concern."This is not "theory" in the sense we sometimes encounter in colloquial speech in the sense of (exclusively) "assumption", especially not with the connotation "unjustified assumption". It is also not a set of rules:"The dependence of a theory on a grasp of certain kinds of similarity between situations and events of the real world gives the reason why the knowledge held by someone who has the theory could not, in principle, be expressed in terms of rules. In fact, the similarities in question are not, and cannot be, expressed in terms of criteria, no more than the similarities of many other kinds of objects, such as human faces, tunes, or tastes of wine, can thus be expressed."Yet, it plays a central role in programming:"For a program to retain its quality it is mandatory that each modification is firmly grounded in the theory of it. Indeed, the very notion of qualities such as simplicity and good structure can only be understood in terms of the theory of the program, since they characterize the actual program text in relation to such program texts that might have been written to achieve the same execution behaviour, but which exist only as possibilities in the programmer's understanding."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t declarative programming and by extension functional programming adhere more to the ethos of ‘Programming as Theory Building’ ?I recently started building mobile apps using Flutter after a decade of developing apps using imperative programming languages and I’m really in love with the declarative nature of flutter.Similarly for web development, I always loved HTML and so HTMX has been a boon for me. I’m using Go for backend, but I’ve been thinking whether I should move on to a proper functional programming language like Elixir with Phoenix since I’m liking declarative programming very much?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592543</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the graphics capabilities of Windows 3.x, particularly focusing on the limitations and features of the graphics programming interfaces available during that era. It explains the transition from 16-bit to more advanced graphics techniques and explores the graphics APIs like GDI (Graphics Device Interface), detailing how they enabled developers to create visually engaging applications despite the constraints of the platform. The piece also touches on the historical context of Windows 3.x in the evolution of PC graphics and the impact it had on software development at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SVGA support aside, it will never cease to astound me that you can load Windows 3.x on a modern standards-supporting PC and get basic VGA working out-of-the-box but you cannot do the same on modern Linux/BSD to get a basic software-accelerated VGA framebuffer supported by Xorg/Wayland if you don't have the right drivers installed (and the correct configuration files manually set up).(the dead xfree86 project was probably the closest attempt to making this "just work" though it had a long way to go; this approach was not preserved in the Xorg fork)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author mentions the screen being corrupted when a DOS prompt is opened in windowed mode. This can happen because the DOS prompt runs in a separate VM (in V86 mode), and makes calls into the VGA ROM BIOS via INT 10h. The VGA ROM BIOS on this machine is probably a wrapper over VBE; that is, it probably contains IN and OUT instructions that talk to the VBE I/O ports, 0x1CE and 0x1CF. These reads and writes from the DOS VM will, by default, be allowed to reach the physical hardware if they are not virtualized by the VMM.This is a common problem that authors of Windows 3.x/9x display drivers had to handle, although the specific I/O port numbers to be virtualized vary by graphics adapter. There are samples in the Win95 DDK that show how to use the VMM services Install_IO_Handler and Enable/Disable_Global_Trapping to set up I/O port traps, and VDD_Get_VM_Info from within the trap handler to determine the VM that currently owns the CRTC. This allows the trap handler to reach a decision about whether to allow an I/O to reach the hardware, or to virtualize the access in some way. A good virtualization policy to start with is probably just to drop any writes from non-CRTC-owner VMs. Any additional needed complexity can be added from there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That old Windows 3.1 GUI looks so much more intuitive, efficient, and usable compared to what we've got today.https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/640...What would Win11 even look like on a lower-resolution display such as in TFA?The Win11 Start Menu is borderline unusable beyond typing in a keyword and praying to the circuits.  What happened?Naive hypothesis: Windows NT and 2k hit a sweet spot, then product managers have been working their magic ever since.KDE and Gnome are looking more and more appealing over time, despite not changing much.  :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594024</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous I/O completion notification was a huge innovation, allowing computation to proceed concurrently with I/O and thus dramatically increasing the throughput of the computer.  Unfortunately it was also a huge source of bugs.  The following innovation that made it usable, by making it less bug-prone, was called a "multitasking operating system".  The so-called "OS" allowed you to write simple sequential code, but used the computer efficiently by switching back and forth between multiple tasks as their respective I/Os completed.  We're talking about the introduction of the Univac 1103A in 01953, 72 years ago, and the following 20 years of innovations, including things like Dijkstra's THE operating system.That is, asynchronous I/O is 20 years older than the Unix system call interface this article speculates it should replace.Of course, context switching between different tasks is not free, and event loops have frequently been able to provide higher efficiency.  The equilibrium has rocked back and forth as I/O has gotten faster and slower relative to task context switching.  CICS, select(), poll(), Oberon, the Macintosh system, Win16, the JavaScript event loop, Tcl/Tk, Win32 IOCP, Symbian active objects, kqueue, epoll, and io_uring are some of the results.But don't try to sell asynchronous I/O as a "game-changing" paradigm shift.  It's a different programming model that's harder to program but can provide higher performance, just like it has been for 70 years.If you're shopping for a paradigm shift that can improve this tradeoff, there are several candidates.  Erlang-style lightweight processes, software transactional memory, and JS-style promises (originally from E, which was inspired by KeyKOS, which had event loops but no promises or asynchronous I/O) come to mind.The hardware development that might be actually new has arguably already failed in the market: Intel/Micron's "Optane" memory and Flash-based NVDIMMs.  Flash has big disk energy, but is fast enough that copying it to RAM one word at a time like disk will probably bottleneck your performance by an order of magnitude.  io_uring doesn't fix this.  We need interfaces designed for zero-copy access to bulk persistent data.  Maybe something like Multics or mmap().  LMDB and FlatBuffers suggest that the potential for improved performance is significant. Could such high-bandwidth, low-cost memory keep up with LLM inference, allowing you to do inference on a 256-gigabyte model with 256 gigabytes of Flash but a much smaller amount of RAM?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;"Our operating systems want to do things asynchronously, on their own terms. They'll tell you when they're done. Maybe this is a new era. Maybe making syscalls from 1970s Unix directly is like a remote procedure call to another machine - a leaky abstraction, a feeble attempt to impose your old mental model onto a new reality."I think the article fell off here. Linux has a profoundly synchronous I/O system. The I/O U-Ring works there by dispatching requests to a kernel-maintained pool of worker threads. There the submitted request are run synchronously.So the I/O U-Ring is in fact the abstraction, "a feeble attempt to impose your [new] mental model onto an [old] reality", as the author might put it. The actual Linux I/O system is most trivially exposed to userland by the same old "1970s Unix" means of the traditional system calls.The real change with the I/O U-Ring is that it offers a way to submit work in bulk and finally introduces to Linux a form of I/O that appears to the program to be truly asynchronous.(And it's not without some fair cause that file I/O is implemented as synchronous code. It's hard to do it asynchronously when it's a complex operation with many steps, where you are interacting with a page cache, not only for file contents but even caching the very metadata that describes how to get from an offset into a file to the block numbers where the data is stored. Windows has a famously profoundly asynchronous I/O system and even there actual file I/O is done just the same with synchronous logic ran in a worker thread, or copied directly from the cache if the requested data is already there.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This change of mentality is similar to how monolithic kernels get praised, only to have daemons, microservices and containers all over the place, using a much slower OS IPC communication channel than if it had been a microkernel from the start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592126</guid></item><item><title>16.

What more did Williams need to do the first time he reached out to garner interest? Does ProPublica overestimate the seriousness of the militia movement? I’d think based on J6 the journalists ignoring Williams’ communications should have paid attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infinite Luigis Theory:I get a sense that we are beginning to see a resurgence in lone-wolf style operator activism and crime (or terrorism, etc., depending on your view of things), sort of like was more common 30+ years ago, a la the Unibomber, Skyjacker, all of the serial killers in the 60-80s.The reasons of “why now” and “why lone wolf” are complicated but mostly boil down to high availability of information (awareness of opsec) and relatively low trust amongst social groups and of institutions, coupled with a more online and more destabilized male demographic the younger you go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sowing that distrust is why Williams is going on the record, albeit without his original nameI don’t understand this. There’s an insane level of detail here that if true immediately reveals his identity to those involved. How does withholding his name change anything?&gt; On March 20… He’d helped persuade Seddon and his lieutenants to fire the head of AP3’s Utah chapter and to install Williams in his place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594766</guid></item><item><title>18.

The library facilitates the manipulation and parsing of SWC files, allowing developers to extract and work with their contents programmatically. SWC4J aims to provide a simple and efficient way to integrate SWC functionality into Java applications, making it easier to manage Flash components and assets. The repository includes documentation, examples, and a structured framework for users to leverage SWC files within their Java-based environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh my word, there may finally be a Typescript parser for the JVM? I have wanted this for the longest time, and it's been on my radar to take on as a project in the near future. If this is a reasonably complete parser, this will save me a ton of time. My use case is parsing Typescript type definitions.Edit: unfortunately, this seems to be a JNI bridge to the Rust code in SWC, I was hoping for a JVM-native solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some use cases for this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590788</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title doesn’t do it justice - everything with images quickly adds up.Doing 120 fps video at 4K so that any chosen frame looks amazing without artifacts is really quite an achievement.The microphones were actually more interesting to me, that you can get lavalier performance from the tiny mics in the phone that are physically far from the person being recorded is seriously clever.Getting this to work some of the time is already an achievement but I think people underestimate how much work goes into making it work across all different scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; 38% of people said that better cameras are a main motivation for buying a new phoneThis strikes me as just a reflection of the ad campaigns. Apple promotes “better cameras” for every new iPhone, almost exclusively in their ads, so it’s not surprising that’s what people would say. With every new phone being just an incremental upgrade, hyping up the camera is the only way to get people to drop a $1000 on a new one. Most of these 38% won’t be able to tell the difference between a phone pic taken 5 or more years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really a puff piece - for instance, Nokia had a 1 billion pixels per second processing pipeline on their 808 PureView phone.  In 2012.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557924</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when PistonMiner finished the fix and executed it on the "flight model". They were quite literally jumping up and down in happiness and the whole Chair of Space Technology at TU Berlin was gossipping about it in the hallways :) Amazing hack, absolute hats off to them. By the way, this is their bachelor's thesis.We have used the vtable trick many times in satellite software operations, whenever we had to "quickly patch" this or that function, without having to uplink a whole software update - which as they explain in the talk, is quite an involved process that takes significant time and resources to complete.Happy to answer or forward any questions about nanosatellites, software in space, etc!P.S.: it looks there is a bit of a mix-up with the audio of the recorded talks. The default audio track contains a Polish dubbing. Select the "eng-deu-pol 1080p (mp4)" which seems to be the correct one. (And thanks to the A/V team at CCC for your efforts to make this content accessible to everyone &lt;3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A neat detail from the talk: It's on the Amateur Radio 70cm band, and has a digipeater running. PistonMiner is willing to turn it on for people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say this is perhaps one of my favourite CCC talks.Interesting subject matter, novel technical problems and solutions, story narrated at speed and with just enough information to fill in typical knowledge gaps, and on top of all of that there's slides and answers ready to go for random questions from the audience.Wonderful job, PistonMiner!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575390</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My active hours are typically very early AM, 2-4AM, until 10AM, and there is definitely a space for this in the market for individuals that just want a place to relax and/or work outside of their home outside of normal working hours. Starbucks used to fill this niche where I lived (they would open at 3,4AM to accommodate students in the area trying to study for finals. Nowadays, most of these starbucks/coffee shops have closed or shifted to an in-store hostile setup of a drive through plus a lobby that is mostly intended for delivery drivers, walled off laptop plugs and won't tell you why, removed all charging stations, and just generally made it a shitty experience to sit inside and do anything at all other than get the hell out. This is almost universal now where i live, a college town with multiple colleges, and I wouldn't even begin to tell you where to find a coffee shop where I could gather with 3-4 other grad students and bang some crazy project out in a few hours anymore, and I have many, many big colleges near me. There's a demand the market isn't meeting, but, that demand didn't rake in the most dollars so here we are and this is some kind of novelty. These kinds of spaces existed basically everywhere in my area circa 2012-2018. They weren't tied to any particular ethnicity, just was a need people apparently had.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My general takeaway from a bunch of comments is that there were two death waves for these late night places. But, I have a great fix.First, Starbucks committed coffeeshopicide by targeting local hangouts that were  successful, and then spraying their own burnt grounds, driving up real estate and making it impossible for a small, less efficient shop to survive. I saw this happen at several great places in Portland. Then, obviously a career climbing executive at Starbucks tried to get promoted and tightened up hours.The second wave of late night coffee shop deaths occured with COVID and homelessness (really McKinsey and Purdue opioids, read "When McKinsey Comes to Town") because of safety. No one, big or small, can offer a space and decide which hipster can stay and which has to leave because he is now addicted to drugs and not just Instagram dopamine.The solution: cities should offer a tax break to a coffee shop that stays open late. And, cities should offer a match where they create a space nearby for homeless people to congregate late night. I'm sure there is a correlation between the number of homeless and soon-to-be homeless creative types.I'm saddened late night coffee shops have largely disappeared, these Yemeni shops look terrific. And, they bring the social back to meeting places, and I don't mean social media and laptops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are coffee shops just the answer to having social spaces that aren't alcohol fueled like bars and clubs? For quite a while I have had a rough idea that there could be something along the lines of a bar but with no alcohol and some kind of structured activities for breaking the ice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584610</guid></item><item><title>22.

To me the interesting question would be how far can you push the freestanding accuracy of a pendelum clock.That is not to say this isn't a neat project in it's own right, it is, but just picking on the terminology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's the first time I see a Czech/Slovak accented "č" on the front page of Hacker News.

&lt;p&gt;The project "elks" on GitHub is focused on developing a lightweight Linux kernel designed specifically for embedded systems and retro computing. It aims to create a small, efficient environment capable of running on limited hardware resources, making it suitable for older platforms and minimalistic applications. The repository includes documentation, source code, and resources for building and using the kernel, encouraging contributions and collaboration from developers interested in embedded systems and low-resource computing scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the comments! ELKS will run on an 8088, but also runs on any x86 PC using the legacy "real mode" which runs in 16-bit segmented architecture without an MMU or any hardware protection. It can be fun to boot a PC and see a close resemblance to Linux, but run the way things used to be, using only 16-bits.It'll also run in ROM, e.g. using a 8018x CPU w/onboard PIT and PIC.The point of ELKS today is about "small is beautiful" and seeing what can be done when limited to 64k code and 64k data, and 640k RAM. It's based on a very old fork of Linux and many of the internal structures are similar to what was found in Linux 2.0, without the changes for SMP support.We just recently got a native C compiler/assembler/linker toolchain up and running. I must say making that happen provided some vivid comparisons of what programmers had to go through in decades past in both slower speeds and small executable file sizes, versus what we all have and expect today at our fingertips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently added dual screen support to the ELKS console-direct driver, so if your system has both MDA and CGA cards, you enable CONFIG_CONSOLE_DUAL in your kernel config and select runlevel 5 in /bootopts, it will allocate 4 ttys, with one of them on the MDA display. You can see this setup running on my hardware in this pic in the README:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaerr/elks/refs/heads/mas...I could use some help testing it on EGA and VGA hardware, as I don’t have any 8 bit cards for those in my collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The memories. I had it run ("installed" would be a big word ona 2 flopppy and no hard drive system) on a super cute Carry-1 8088 computer ages ago, which I stupidly sold on Ebay shortly after as I had no use for it.
Here's one of the very rare photos online.

&lt;p&gt;The article reflects on the memories of Canadian xennials, a generation born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, and their experiences with technology, culture, and societal changes during their formative years. It highlights key aspects of their upbringing, including the shift from analog to digital, nostalgic references to childhood entertainment, and the unique position xennials hold between Generation X and millennials.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The picture in this blog is the later version of the ICON, but it ran the same QNX OS, programs, and games, and used the same LEXICON file server for it all.In case anyone is interested in more information about the earlier version of the ICON (and the LEXICON file server it ran from), here are my two blogs posts:https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/icon-computer/https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/lexicon-computer/One interesting QNX command we used to get in trouble in high school was apb (all points bulletin) - here's a demo of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr8ts6zV2DU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Each Unisys ICON came with its own monitor and a very robust keyboard with a trackball embedded in it.The trackballs were robust indeed.Due to the client/server nature; a classroom of kids logging in at the same time could take several minutes and most of that time would be filled with a classroom of 7 year olds spinning the heck out of the tennis ball sized trackball.One more knowledgeable teacher once told us that the this probably made the computers slower because each time you do something it has to pause and decide what to do. I guess he understood interrupts somehow.But that logic doesn’t work on 8 year olds with a trackball and nothing else to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Ottawa, where QNX originates. My high school must have had someone with family connections to the company, because we could have built a significant Beowulf cluster with all the Icons.These systems had numerous problems, one of which was the school board's severe lack of resources to manage them. The teachers were limited in what they were allowed or able to do, so if a lab went down, it typically took about a week to get someone to fix it. As students, we used this to our advantage. I have fond memories of causing all sorts of issues on these systems as a kid. Another perk was that my school wasn’t air-conditioned, except for the computer labs, so during the hot months it's where you wanted to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594387</guid></item><item><title>25.

I’m amazed by the ingenuity of running a CNN on a TI-84 Plus CE.Given the ez80 CPU's limitations with floating-point operations, do you think fixed-point arithmetic could significantly speed up inference without adding too much complexity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mostly unrelated, but I remember typing in a simple calculator program (hex codes I think) from a magazine for my Apple IIe that would then speak the answer aloud. I was fascinated by the fact you could type in things that then created the sound of a voice. Googling isn't yielding much but I'll dig around and see if I can find it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I first started coding in high school on the TI-84 calculators. My 1st language was TI-BASIC, 2nd was Z80 assembly - quite a big step - and I quit when I faced some tricky bugs that my teenage self could not figure out :-) Back then, I don't believe they had a C/C++ toolchain. Some time later, I tried using Small Device C compiler (SDCC), but encountered several compiler bugs which I couldn't fix but duly reported. Great to see there is such excellent tooling nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584860</guid></item><item><title>26.

For instance the noise generators in audio chips of 80s home computers were typically an LFSR with around 16 bits of state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any particular reason why this straightforward implementation of a well-known PRNG (published by Marsaglia 20 years ago) is worth being linked from HN's first page?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was just reading about this because I am writing a chess engine.  I am using somebody else's move generator, I am not sure how it works but it is not front of mind because it is spending most time evaluating and managing transposition tables according to the profiler, I can at least 5x those and maybe I will worry about another microoptimisation then.  But really move ordering can make a 10x change and I am going to iterative deepening, pv, killer heuristic and such.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592316</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IRL I knew someone who was charged with child sexual abuse.  He went to prison awaiting trial, but the prosecution dropped the charges before it got there.  He was released and went about his life.Meanwhile his mug shot photo in the local paper was the number one google search result for his name.  And then it reached syndication for other news sites as well.Ideally those news paper articles should be updated to say the prosecution dropped the charges, but the reality is that at where I live, the arrest makes news but the prosecution dropping charges does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I understand this is the general policy in a few places, like Germany. The general idea seems to be that it is more beneficial to a society if criminals are given a viable avenue to lead non-criminal lives again, with the alternative being people going "ah fuck it, I guess I'm a criminal now".I'm surprised at this concept spreading in the US, since the system would generally benefit from having perpetual perpetrators percolating through the prison slavery system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of a laugh-out-loud closing paragraph in a 2009 NYT article about the clash between Wikipedia &amp; German lawyers over some infamous murderers' right-to-be-forgotten.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/us/13wiki.htmlRead the whole thing for maximum effect, but for me it beautifully demonstrates the contrast between the USA/Wikipedia/NYT ethos of "the truth is always printable and your speech is by default 'on the record'" and alternate expectations elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42595307</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pay for Rewind, and honestly, it’s one of the best investments I've made in software. After each Zoom meeting, I receive a summary of everything discussed, including action items to add to my to-do list. Every Monday, I also ask it to remind me of what I accomplished the previous week to help me prepare for my 1:1 meeting. Everything is recorded locally, allowing me to search for anything I did earlier in the day quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;capturing and uploading a whole new PNG for each screencap is not what I would call 'efficient', and to meet the use case of Rewind.ai in the first place it should have some OCR mechanism to pull up the relevant screencaps.The thing that enabled rewind.ai and MS Recall is storing the series of screenshots more like a HEIF, allowing for massive compression ratio and on-device storage + OCR provided by the OS (Live Text since Monterey 2021 [0], Microsoft introduced it last year for Snapdragon based AI-PCs [1])I guess this is a good starting point if the goal is to fill S3 buckets with screencaps of multiple users, but then we're just back to corporate spyware, not tools for helping individuals use their machine more effectively.That said, if I was using my own minio backend, it would be neat to archive my screen captures but I would change it so it captures after, say, every keystroke, and every time my mouse stops moving, and after every click. That way I have high density capture of taking actions, and low density otherwise. In any case collecting the data is not the issue, making an interface where that data becomes useful to help me remember something is.[0] https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/interact-with-text-i...[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/apis/text-recog...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Hypothesis: the world's most valuable data is screen captures of outlier competent people going about their work. But very little of this data is recorded, let alone made publicly available.It's not quite screen captures, but the way in which any given email is responded to by competent users in your own organization is highly relevant in this context, especially if you place original+reply email pairs into a RAG framework and add function calls for structured domain knowledge.Unified APIs like https://www.nylas.com/ which an admin can unilaterally connect across an entire org can make this quite viable - assuming you've done the work to build a culture where radical transparency is seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.There's a lot of nuance required to avoid hallucinations, but organizations that are merely training chatbots on explicit Q&amp;A documents are just scratching the surface of the depth of their semi-structured data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42596607</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores China's dominance in global manufacturing, arguing that it has emerged as the world's sole manufacturing superpower. It outlines the historical context leading to this rise, including globalization and economic policies that have facilitated China's growth. The discussion highlights key factors such as advancements in technology, labor force dynamics, and government support that have contributed to China's manufacturing prowess. Additionally, the piece examines the implications of this dominance for global supply chains and economic power, raising questions about the future of manufacturing in other nations in response to China's continued ascendance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing people are not aware of and am curious of how big it really is: China manufacturing laundry. Essentially, goods are manufactured in China, then laundered to a third-party country and then exported to the US/EU. This come in two flavors, legal laundry where the local manufacturer satisfies the conditions; and illegal one where bribes are paid to pass goods.&gt; https://antidumping.vn/eu-chinabike-duty-hits-indonesia-mala...I come from a country that does this. Massive deficit with China vs. an equivalent surplus with the EU. Weak manufacturing base that essentially import Chinese, does some packaging and then export it back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh. For all the claims that US manufacturing is down, it does seem that if we adjusted per-capita it's on par with China based on the figures presented here, which I really didn't expect to seeI'm no expert and of course I have no clue if it even makes sense to measure per-capita manufacturing share, and also assume a lot of other factors matter here - what kinds of things we're manufacturing, how much those products serve domestic versus export markets, etc - but it's still surprising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is amazing and filled with facts that i wish everyone arguing the point that china cant overtake U.S. in economy or world superpowers would read. The facts are there, there is not much hiding around the corner, all of the true indication is in front of us. Yes. the article states U.S. still holds the title for world superpower by military size and capabilities. That's not to say that china cant catch up in no time with U.S. military. That's if they decide to do so. i would ask does the Chinese republic need to invest heavy in this sector in order to grow? Clearly not from the facts. in fact that's the very same thing we should have been doing all along.The U.S. has spent enormous amount of capital to fund wars and foreign relational activities.China has a great way going about this. making friends with less developed countries that U.S. overlooked. China is looking for something specific. Just as U.S. is looking for something specific as well. To be totally honest I am not entirely sure what the  U.S. is looking for when engaging with other countries, other than the same narrative for the fear of not having safety blah blah. This time that was spent on these adventures the U.S. cannot get back, while also injuring foreign relations.there is a clear sign that the U.S. government is confused and has a gun with no-where to aim. All the policies and efforts are accelerating the U.S. into deterioration. The U.S. has some strong sector for the sake of this reply i will mainly say that attacking the top tech firms and industries with regulation will only push them out to more favorable grounds give new room for industries to form in more favorable grounds other than U.S.. the solution must solve the problem that brought the solution to existence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592665</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a tool called Transcendental Syntax, designed for analyzing linguistic structures and syntax through an innovative computational framework. It offers a set of algorithms and functionalities that help in understanding the relationships between language components, along with examples and documentation aimed at researchers and developers in the field of computational linguistics. The project is open-source, encouraging contributions and collaboration from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so French that a baguette appeared in my hand after I clicked the theory link. Probably a cognitive hazard to anyone who is really into generics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an implementation of Girard's "transcendental syntax" program which aims to give foundations to logic that do not rely on axiomatics and a form of tarskian semantics (tarskian semantics is the idea that "A &amp; B" is true means that "A" and "B" is true; you've simply changed the and to a "meta" one rather than the logical one). This program is more than 10 years old, with first written versions appearing around 2016, and the ideas appearing in his talks before that.Girard has been a vocal critic of foundational problems, labeling them as "hell levels", with the typical approach of set theory and tarskian semantics as the lowest one and category theory as a "less worse" one (at least one level above). 
One issue with his program is that he mixes abstract, philosophical ideas with technical ones.
So even if some things have interesting technical applications, they may be different when seen from a more philosophical point of view. 
For instance, set theory as the foundations of mathematics is a pretty solid model but it is seen as fundamentally unsatisfying for many reasons -- most famously the continuous hypothesis. Gödel and other very high-profile mathematicians thought it was a very unsatisfying issue even though from a mathematical model theory point of view, it's not even a paradox. 
So the new foundational approaches tend to have maybe deeper philosophical problems about them; for example see Jacob Lurie's critic of the Univalent foundations program (after the "No comment" meme he expressed a long list of issues with it).The other issue with this particular work is that it uses new vocabulary for everything to avoid the bagage of usual mathematical logic, but it kind of give a weird vibe to the work and make it hard to get into without dedicating much work.The result is therefore something that is supposed to solve many longstanding problems in philosophical and technical approaches to the foundations of mathematics but has not had a big impact on the community. This is not too surprising either because the lambda calculus or other logical works were seen as trivial mathematical games. 
We'll see if it's a case of it being too novel to be appreciated fully, and this work seems to try to explore it in a technical way to answer this question.https://girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Logique.html (in French, it gives an overview of the program)https://girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Archives.html (transcendental syntax papers are there in English)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of Girard, I've been very attracted to his ideas about the "dynamics" of logic and "communication without understanding". It always appears to me that such ideas and things like the "execution formula" should have profound implications on static analysis of algorithms and things like abstract interpretation and collapsing stacks of interpreters.Has there been any literature on concrete steps in this direction, or is there anything holding back Girard's theories from practical application (I know that Girard's Geometry of Interaction was supposed to have problems with additives, of which exact implications I do not quite comprehend, which may or may not be relevant)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42589629</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide to recursion, a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It explains the fundamentals of recursion, including how to write recursive functions, the importance of base cases, and common pitfalls to avoid. The article includes practical examples in Python, demonstrating how recursion can be used to simplify code for tasks such as calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, and traversing data structures. Additionally, it emphasizes the benefits of understanding recursion for developing problem-solving skills and offers exercises to practice the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

During the months I’ve spent writing this book, I can assure you that this joke gets funnier the more you hear it.I love to read books like this rather than the AI generated slush that seems to be so abundant today. This author has done a great job here. Although I have to say, it is sad that I feel like I have to ‘audit’ everything to see if it’s written by a robot before I invest too much time in it /:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Claiming recursion is taught badly and then trying to teach recursion immediately via call stacks is certainly a choice. The guts of how your favorite compiler implements recursion is hardly what I would call "the correct way" to teach the concept.It's not shocking that students snooze their way through discrete math, try their hardest to forget induction proofs, and the arrive in algorithms or some other higher level class and try their hardest to forget recursion/dynamic programming.The reality is the concepts are hard and demand practice to obtain familiarity. There is no quick path to mathematical maturity. If you try your hardest to phone in induction then surprise surprise recursion is nonsensical to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading "Automate boring stuffs with Python" it helped me a lot while I was in my early college years.I glanced through the initial chapter of this book, and it is so well written even for any newbie to understand.Personally I have had pretty hard time understanding recursion and all the intricacies of it, and still sometimes can't wrap my head around it.Would love to read this book, I have filled the fotm for a review to read the free ebook, hopefully i receive a copy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583181</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "clobbering" in the context of software development, particularly focusing on how certain programming practices can lead to unintended consequences and bugs. It emphasizes the importance of proper code organization and management to prevent issues that arise from overwriting or conflicting data structures. The author provides examples and strategies to avoid these pitfalls, ultimately advocating for better coding habits and awareness among developers to improve software reliability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking as an Asm programmer for several decades: Calling conventions are stupid. They are the results of mindless stupid-compiler-oriented thinking from a time when compilers produced horrible copy-paste-replace code. The CPU itself couldn't care less which registers you use for what. So many wasted bytes on moving values between registers, just because the calling convention wanted it there, and no other reason. The only need to pay attention to calling conventions is when you're interfacing with compiler-generated code. Modern CPUs are fast, but there's still tons of inefficiency in compiler output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GoLang assembly boggles my mind - I understand why it's there, but having looked at it few times makes me wonder if it could've been prevented somehow (I guess not, cryptographic primitives would be way too slow, redirecting them through some kind of ffi would require a shared lib, yada yada yada)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42583246</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my first job, I did some field service work.  I was 17 and it was 1979.  Asteroids appeared in arcades that year, but I had become unbeatable at Space Wars (released in 1977) by then.  The Battlezone video game was released in 1980.One day I visited a computer lab at the Northrop plant (before the Grumman merger) in Hawthorne, CA to upgrade some hardware.  (This location later became the SpaceX headquarters up until they moved to Texas six months ago.)  While in the lab, I saw an F18 cockpit mock up connected to a flight simulator with a vector display.  The computer running it looked like an HP1000 (2100).  While chatting with the nerds in the lab about it, they offered me a chance to fly in it.  I got in, took off, and flew around for a while until I flew past the simulation boundary and it crashed.  After they reset it, I flew a bit more and then tried a landing on the simulated 10,000 foot runway.  I managed to land without crashing into the tank they had placed in the middle of the runway.I saw a very similar looking tank a few years later when I first played Battlezone.  I always wondered if one of the Battlezone developers had "borrowed" the 3D model for it from Northrop.https://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2020/04/battlezo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We take games for granted now, but in the early 80s the anticipation of what might be possible was something else. The War Games scene where the magazine ad for an unannounced game motivates Broderick's character to start wardialing all the phones in Sunnyvale felt pretty reasonable.If you read sci-fi, it's akin to the imaginative feelings of space travel and futuristic realities. Back then it was reasonable to imagine that an upcoming game might shift your life into a higher gear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you liked Battlezone back in the day, you can't miss its more modern incarnation: BZFlag.https://www.bzflag.org/Fully Open Source, damn fun, with lots of servers, maps, and different play modes.
Unfortunately the community shrank over the years, and it would benefit a lot from more regular players. Want to take a peek? Then don't miss the 1st 2025 event which is due today at 3 pm EST / 20 UTC. You can login as an observer to watch games, but if you want to play you need to register first at bzflag.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591818</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article does a great job summarizing the rapid advancements in reasoning and AI agents. Models like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's r1 demonstrate how inference-time compute and structured Chain of Thought (CoT) are pushing LLM capabilities in STEM and coding tasks. The speculation about pivot words and backtracking behavior learned through reinforcement learning is particularly intriguing—it could be transformative for reasoning in domains with external verification.The discussion on agents and moving beyond chat interfaces toward workflows like Cursor resonated with me. A shift in Human-AI interaction paradigms feels essential to unlock the full potential of autonomous agents. However, as the author notes, error rates and cost remain significant hurdles.I've been experimenting with multi-agent systems in Python for the last year and find measuring performance and success one of the hardest parts. While today's LLM agents are still primitive, they already show immense potential. Even without advances in base models, creative agent design patterns could unlock more functionality, and with better reasoning and larger context windows, the possibilities expand even further.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really well done overview of the evolution of AI in 2024 at a level deeper than just model releases, benchmarks, and agentic systems but digestible by someone at that level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great post but there are some advance terminology that are not that straight-forward in the nitty-details of architectures.. more references would be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591029</guid></item><item><title>39.

But the two have eerily similar thoughts on these result:&gt;Lucy Bisset, Director of Robert Walters North comments: “Gen-Z are known for their entrepreneurial mindset – preferring to bring their ‘whole self’ to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.&gt;Martin Fox, Managing Director of Robert Walters Canada comments: “Gen-Z are known for their entrepreneurial mindset. They prefer to bring their ‘whole self’ to projects, focusing on building their own brand and approach rather than managing others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my 15 years in small and mid-sized tech, I've found the most useless managers are senior managers.Good team leads and second line managers can make or break an organization. But they are the least respected roles at a company and gets thrown under the bus first. Most companies don't invest anything in training new managers or setting clear roles and responsibilities for managers.Senior management never faces any accountability but can make big massive changes to an org without consideration for implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is presented as revolutionary, but it’s not clear to me that the results would’ve been any different if they’d surveyed the older generations at the same age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42590992</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolving landscape of ANT wireless technology, highlighting its potential decline as various companies pivot towards newer standards like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for device connectivity. It examines the implications for athletes and fitness enthusiasts who rely on ANT-enabled devices for tracking performance and health metrics. The author considers the practical aspects of this transition, including compatibility issues and the future of wearable technology, while emphasizing the need for manufacturers to adapt to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a real shame.BLE and ANT+ are fundamentally different, the latter being a broadcast protocol. You can have any number of devices connected/logging the broadcast of an ANT+ device, while BLE is usually limited to one or two devices. I am sure is not a fundamental limitation of BLE but is the reality for the currently available chipsets.The fact that it is unencrypted is completely irrelevant.My heart rate data over a short period of time is not useful to anyone but myself, and that is the only personal data any of my ANT+ devices broadcast.Unless you consider cadence to be personal information but that is also broadcasted to the world visually and is no more secret than the colour of my running or cycling shorts.The rest of my devices broadcast mechanical, device status and/or environmental data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And there is still no BLE replacement for Garmin "Tempe" sensor: no ultra-small rugged temperature sensor on the market (or I cannot find one! If you could point me to one, I will be very grateful!)On the other hand, all Android phones dropped ANT+ support after approximately Android 9. My old Xiaomi Mi A1 supported ANT+ till some major update, my next phone (Samsung A72) didn't support it from the beginning, my current Pixel 8 Pro doesn't support it too. You need true "head unit" and cannot use phone as one.Hardware is here, but drivers are not installed and cannot be installed from Playstore.It is pity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; They are discontinuing membership programs/fees&gt; They are discontinuing certification programs&gt; They are however continuing to ensure ANT+ is available on silicon&gt; All documentation to be made fully available onlinefunny how "the beginning of the end" kind of sounds excellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42597395</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of language learning models (LLMs) and the Cursor tool to enhance productivity when completing projects. It highlights how these technologies can assist with tasks such as brainstorming, drafting, and refining content, ultimately streamlining the work process. The author shares practical tips and benefits of integrating LLMs into daily workflows to help individuals and teams finish projects more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding to what another user said here, when using LLMs for heavy prototyping, I also commit frequently and have a document outlining the opinions contained in the repo.One thing I've also been doing now is I have a "template" to use for fullstack applications that's configured out-of-the-box with tech that I like, has linters and hooks set up, as well as is structured in a way that's natural to me. This makes it a lot more likely that the generated code will follow my preferred style. It's also not uncommon that on the first iteration I get some code that's not what I'd like to have in my codebase and I just say "refactor X in this and this way, see &lt;file&gt; for an example" at which point I mostly get code that I'm happy with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AmazingTwo things I would add:1. Use git and commit changes (very) frequently.Often the AI makes a recommendation that looks good, but has consequences 4 or 5 changes later that you'll need to reckon with.  You'll see this especially with web vs. mobile UI behaviours.  Cursor isn't so good at reverting changes yet, and GIT has saved me a LOT of headache.2.  Collaborate with o1 to create a PRD and put it in the same folder as your specs.This increases the likelihood Cursor's recommended changes comply with your intent, style and color guidelines and overall project direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting use case for LLMs. At first, I thought “why complete an MVP if you don’t have time to iterate it?”.But MVPs are a good testbed for determining if something is worth iterating.I build quick prototypes for validation and LLMs have really helped decrease the effort. Here is an example of a site which took me 2 weeks with help from ChatGPT. https://post.withlattice.com/It was enough to get interior designers to start using it, provide feedback, and validate if it’s worth additional time investment.My hypothesis is that 2025 will bring forth a lot of indie products which focus on doing one thing well and can be supported my a small or fractional team.I look forward this break from VC funded and big tech consumer products!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594256</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Twinge of Saudade" by Chal Ravens examines the concept of saudade, a Portuguese term that describes a deep emotional state of nostalgic longing for something or someone that one loves and has lost. Ravens explores how this feeling permeates various aspects of life, culture, and art, drawing connections between saudade and contemporary experiences of loss and yearning. The piece reflects on the implications of saudade in personal identity and collective memory, suggesting that this emotion shapes how individuals relate to their past while influencing their present and future relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, is "saudade" popular enough now that people are using it without explanation? I searched for the term in the article and it doesn't seem to be defined. Extra unexpected because there does not seem to be any connection to a Portuguese-speaking country in the article. Has it reached "hygge" status?Brazilians (my wife included) describe saudade as a sort of deep longing to be back with a loved one in person. Not sure if it's used in all Portuguese-speaking places or just Brazil (or where the term originated for that matter). The translation honestly seems straightforward enough but often when you ask someone to translate, they get that "on the tip of the tongue" look on their face and say English doesn't really have the right words for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who grew up during this era, I find some of the nostalgic preferences of today's culture to be amusing and nearly random.In addition to ABBA, others that come to mind are Queen and Bob Ross. Not that there's anything wrong with these people, but if you were to go back in time and ask around, I think the overall response would be "why them in particular?"Queen, for example, had a few great songs, but Supertramp overall was better band with a similar musical aesthetic. I have no idea why Queen is now considered one of the greatest acts of all time, while Supertramp is more or less forgotten.ABBA had a bunch of lite rock/pop hits, but to see them talked about seriously in The London Review of Books in 2025 is downright hilarious to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; a Sweden then known to outsiders chiefly for Ingmar Bergman,Arrgh, the flashbacks. Sometimes I regret the extinction of European movie studios, but then there are these examples of ponderous depressing twaddle ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569582</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My spouse is a psychotherapist, and from her 10+ years of work I have seen that it can work very well. But the success depends on the patient’s mental attitude. If you go to a therapist with the mindset „here I am, do something that I feel better (again)“, then I can guarantee you you‘ll be disappointed. A psychotherapist is like a midwife who can help a woman in giving birth to a child, but the woman must go through the process herself, through the pain, the labour. But when you come with the right mindset, do the work, do not expect quick fixes, the results can be transformative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d like to read on actual techniques, cause this post makes me suspicious. That question “how do I feel about it” is only a first step in a complex approach and the focus on it may suggest that there’s something missing in my picture. Which is lots of circumstantial techniques and ideas. I wouldn’t think of pointing this particular question out from all that if I was writing a blog post. Maybe I’m just different?Anyway, I agree when they say that people who need therapy the most are the ones who cannot afford it. It makes you think different, not just pat you on the head and commiserate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try group therapy! It can significantly change your life. I was saying "no fucking way" whenever my psychiatrist suggested it, but after I tried, it turned my life upside down in the best possible way. It will be very uncomfortable first, but worth it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584373</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;In the article, the author, Ann Telnaes, explains her decision to leave The Washington Post after years as a political cartoonist. She reflects on the challenges faced in the current media landscape, including editorial constraints and a diminishing commitment to political satire. Telnaes expresses concerns about the erosion of journalistic integrity and the pressures of commercialism that ultimately influenced her departure, highlighting the importance of independent voices in media. Her move signifies a desire for creative freedom and a more impactful platform for her work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the current political situation in the US is going to accelerate the demise of traditional media. They have not been able to adapt to a changing information landscape and were stuck on models that worked in the past, like "both sides"ing issues sort of reflexively. That works great with a lot of things like "how much should we tax companies?", but not so much for some more fundamental questions like whether someone supports democracy.I'm not sure what will emerge in its place. It's a big problem, and has hit hardest and first among local newspapers which are increasingly hollowed out husks of their former selves. This has a real cost to society that's actually quantifiable in dollars and cents:https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-closures-of-local-new...Things like social media don't really take the place of people paid to do the hard work of, say, sitting through local city council meetings and making sense of what's happening there. A friend of mine tried doing that for fun and it lasted a few years, but he got burned out because of the tremendous amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the cartoonist's principled stance, but she greatly overestimates how free the press is (or was) just because she'd never had a point of view censored. In the words of Noam Chomsky:I don't say you're self-censoring - I'm sure you believe everything you're saying; but what I'm saying is, if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.Yes, her viewpoint wasn't censored up until now, but on the other hand, the Washington Post sure didn't employ anyone remotely similar to e.g. Jared Taylor or Keith Woods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such an innocuous cartoon. I can't believe it would be an issue in this age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42591221</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a new non-invasive method for monitoring blood sugar levels using a wearable device that fits on the wrist, eliminating the need for needles. This innovative technology measures glucose levels through the skin, aiming to improve the lives of those with diabetes by providing a more comfortable and convenient monitoring option. The device integrates advanced sensors and algorithms to deliver accurate readings, potentially transforming diabetes management and enhancing adherence to monitoring routines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Currently, diabetics must frequently prick their fingers or rely on invasive wearable patches with micro-needles to track their blood-sugar levelsType 1 diabetic here - for what it's worth, CGMs aren't particularly invasive. At least in comparison to the many many years of finger pricking! But a smart watch solution would be cool. (I actually do get my CGM readings on my smart watch, which is really nice!)I know Apple has also worked on this stuff in the past, but from what I remember the accuracy wasn't good enough to be safe for diabetics. I'd be really curious to see accuracy stats on this in comparison to Dexcom and Freestyle CGMs.I would definitely be excited to use something like this, but for me, the biggest quality of life improvements for me will be continued improvements with closed loop CGM + insulin pump systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We - at DiaMonTech - are working on non-invasive glucose monitoring for over a decade now. It's a hard and complex problem and as long as clinical data is missing, I'm very sceptical.We just reached (in a clinical trial) a comparable accuracy as early-stage invasive devices that got FDA approved with a shoe-box-sized device and we still have some work to do. The pre-print of our publication is here: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5289491/v1I'm excited to see new developments but in this case, I'm not sure this will reach the market anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounds exciting, but the fact their prototype is in a wristwatch form factor makes me wonder if it's aiming to be more of a media showpiece to hype investment valuation from those industry partners.  Forward looking statements like "maybe we'll make it monitor blood pressure too" don't help.Even at the size of a brick, or without conveniently hiding the power supply off-camera, forgoing needles would still be a huge boon to diabetics.  Why not get the concept working and demo some hard stats, then miniaturize?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599189</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;A University of Alabama chemical engineering professor is leading research aimed at improving plastic recycling methods. The focus is on developing innovative processes that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling plastic materials, thereby addressing global challenges related to plastic waste and sustainability. The research aims to create solutions that could lead to more environmentally friendly practices within the industry and promote the circular economy by maximizing the reuse of plastic resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Can we have a new process for good government too, please?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be happy if we just put recyclable materials in their own corner of the landfills marked "TODO"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42598458</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I worked at arXiv one of my coworkers was a fresh astrophysics PhD who was cynical about the state of the field.  He thought that we didn't know what the hell was going on with accretion disks but that a few powerful people in the field created the impression that we did and that there was no dissent because it was so difficult to get established in the field.When I first saw the ΛCDM model my first impression was that I'd didn't believe it,  it seemed bad enough to have dark matter that we didn't understand (though WIMPs and axions are plausible) but adding equally mysterious and physically unmotivated dark energy made it seem just an exercise in curve fitting.There have been a longstanding problem that the history of the universe and cosmological distance scale haven't made sense.https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-hubble-tension-sti...When I was getting my PhD in condensed matter physics I was going to the department colloquium all the time and seeing astrophysics talks about how some people thought the hubble constant was 40 km/s/Mpc and others thought it was 80 km/s/Mpc.  With timescape cosmology maybe they were both right.Another longstanding problem in astronomy is that since the 1970s it's been clear we have no idea of how supermassive black holes could have formed in the time we think the universe has existed.  With the JWST there are a flood of results that show the first 500 million years of the universe probably lasted a lot more than 500 million yearshttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac9b22&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here’s an extended comment by another astrophysicst: https://telescoper.blog/2025/01/02/timescape-versus-dark-ene...The most important bit:&gt; The new papers under discussion focus entirely on supernovae measurements. It must be recognized that these provide just one of the pillars supporting the standard cosmology. Over the years, many alternative models have been suggested that claim to “fix” some alleged problem with cosmology only to find that it makes other issues worse. That’s not a reason to ignore departures from the standard framework, but it is an indication that we have a huge amount of data and we’re not allowed to cherry-pick what we want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading this as a layman, it looks like releasing ΛCDM's cosmological principle [1] reveals the nontrivial temporal effects mass clusters have via general relativity. As a result, there could be empty regions of space in which billions of years more have elapsed than in e.g. a galaxy. This not only changes how we interpret supernova data (the acceleration isn't generally happening, but an artefact of looking through space which is older than our own), but may also negate the need for dark matter (EDIT: dark energy) and the meaning of a single age of our univese.(I'm also vaguely remembering a multi-universe model in which empty space inflates quicker than massed space.)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42566748</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ethical implications of AI technology, drawing parallels to the past debates surrounding digital piracy. It argues that while accessing AI tools may seem harmless, the underlying issues of ownership, intellectual property, and the potential for harm require careful consideration. The author emphasizes the need for responsible usage of AI and the importance of respecting creators' rights, encouraging readers to reflect on the broader consequences of their interactions with AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

The second part is reverse engineering the tokenizer and input transformations that are needed to before passing the data to the model, and outputting a human readable format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I noticed in Gboard is it uses homeomorphic encryption to do federated learning of common words used amongst public to do encrypted suggestions.E.g. there are two common spelling of bizarre which are popular on Gboard : bizzare and bizarre.Can something similar help in model encryption?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a huge fan of ML on device. It’s a big improvement in privacy for the user. That said, there’s always a chance for the user to extract your model, so on-device models will need to be fairly generic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601549</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage serves as an interactive playground for experimenting with CSS Flexbox, a layout model that allows for responsive design by distributing space dynamically to child elements in a container. Users can manipulate various properties of Flexbox, such as direction, alignment, and wrapping, to see instant visual results. The site includes practical examples and adjustable settings to help users understand how Flexbox works and discover its potential for creating modern web layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem is that its properties and values were named by a committee, so they aren't intuitive to anyone who wasn't involved in the long proceedings that led up to the spec being written. You try to remember which one is justify-content, which one is align-items, and so forth, and just give up and try everything until something seems to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know others have already mentioned it, but i've recommended https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to others before and they quickly picked it up.This is another good one for learning css grid https://cssgridgarden.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I highly recommend Josh's guide: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox...It goes over more advanced gotchas and tips in detail such as flex-basis, auto margins, min-width, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600586</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal works, detailing the challenges posed by NAT in establishing peer-to-peer connections. It discusses the importance of protocols like STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) in facilitating communication between devices behind NATs. The blog also highlights Tailscale's solution using wireguard to create secure connections while navigating NAT issues, allowing devices to connect seamlessly even in restrictive network environments. Overall, the piece emphasizes the significance of effective NAT traversal for improving network connectivity and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent article!The tribal knowledge seems to be that you shouldn't do TCP-based hole punching because it's harder than UDP. The author acknowledges this:&gt; You can do NAT traversal with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending on how deep you want to go.However, I only see marginally added complexity (given the already complex UDP flows). IMO this complexity doesn't justify discarding TCP hole punching altogether. In the article you could replace raw UDP packets to initiate a connection with TCP SYN packets plus support for "simultaneous open" [0].This is especially true if networks block UDP traffic which is also acknowledged:&gt; For example, we’ve observed that the UC Berkeley guest Wi-Fi blocks all outbound UDP except for DNS traffic.My point is that many articles gloss over TCP hole punching with the excuse of being harder than UDP while I would argue that it's almost equally feasible with marginal added complexity.[0] https://ttcplinux.sourceforge.net/documents/one/tcpstate/tcp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinatingly effective, but maybe I'm the only one getting the heebie-jeebies when someone suggests implementing this in production corp networks. Sure it's super convenient, but the thought of bypassing all traditional NATs and firewalls, and instead relying solely on a software ACL, seems super risky. Maybe I just don't understand how it works, but it seems that a bad actor getting access to a stray VM with Tailscale on it in, say, your AWS testing env, essentially has an clear path all the way into your laptop on the internal corp network, through the kernel, into user space and into the Tailscale ACL code as the sole arbiter of granting or blocking access. Would I even know someone unauthorized made it that far?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was a tailscale-like equivalent without connectivity encryption, for devices which encrypt at the application layer (like almost the entire internet does). We don't always need the lower layers to be encrypted, this is especially computationally expensive for low power devices (think IoT stuff running a tailscale like tunnel).GRE tunnels exist and I actually use them extensively, but UDP hole punching is not handled so hub-and-spoke architecture is needed for them, no peer to peer meshes with GRE (ip fou).Are there equivalent libraries out there which do UDP hole punching and unencrypted GRE tunnels following an encrypted handshake to confirm identity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600846</guid></item><item><title>7.

Having used reStructuredText for a thesis with a lot of bells and whistles, and having used org-mode mostly ever since, I am not just admitting it willy-nilly. Then of course some of its syntax and syntax concepts are straight out of reStructuredText's book, so it makes sense, that it would inherit the capabilities as well.What I haven't seen at a quick glance is the ability to link to any place in the document (sink) from withing the document itself (source). Maybe I did not look far enough in the examples. reStructuredTex can do this, and org-mode can do that too. And I don't mean just linking to existing headings. The other required things like footnotes and citations and so on seem to be there. Now if this reaches mainstream and we start writing documentation in it, there is great potential to have finally good documentation, not limited by the likes of github markdown. Of course same is true for reStructuredText and org-mode. From that perspective, one could ask, why yet another format was necessary, rather than improving tooling for lets say reStructuredText.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've really had a pet peeve about footnotes on mobile and this does the crime. If you click a footnote and it jumps very far away and doesn't have a return navigation, I have left your page usually after the second time I see a footnote and didn't note my exact scroll. A small thing but pretty please don't make me have to hunt for where I was...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No relation to the best-selling 90's PC game "Myst", in case anyone was wondering like I was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573388</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sold a laptop on eBay once long, long ago. Someone did the "Buy it now" option but never paid. I'm trying to remember the exact situation (probably more than 10 years ago), but I had exchanged messages with him several times and he always had an excuse to not pay.Then I noticed he was selling the exact same model of laptop so it was easy for me to realize that he had just "bought" my laptop to remove the listing so it wouldn't compete against his. I messaged ebay support to accuse him but they didn't do anything about it.Since he had made the order, eBay did show me his shipping information so I ordered a "glitter bomb" which was basically glitter in a tube with a spring. I got a very nasty accusatory email from him, but it was very vague. He wouldn't specify what he received, but that he was smart enough to not open it. That's how I knew he got the full effect.I just replied something to the effect of "You never paid me. Why would I send something to you?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fair number of years ago now, I had a business idea and bought a domain. Within a couple hours I had a person email me offering me $250 for the domain. I countered with $2,000 saying I would have to rebrand. I'd really done literally nothing but buy the domain at that point, but I wasn't interested in selling and it was a "Go Away" price. They accepted.Used a well known Escrow site. Took a couple days to settle. Quickest $2,000 I ever made. I found out later they were some crypto company with a similar name. They bought it from me just to squat. They still squat it.I probably could have made way more if I had pushed the issue, oh well.Never really built much more than a proof of concept for my business idea and never found another domain I liked enough to buy for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't have a great opinion of marketing in general and therefore I'm often unconvinced with arguments like "marketing is about fulfilling a customer's needs" or "adding efficiency to the market".Therefore I feel vindicated when a moderately-upvoted post says the quiet part out loud, namely, "Yeah, we made a fake post and just lied to everyone on the internet. I'm not sorry, because not only was it popular - it became the top post of the day."Remember, kids: lying is only wrong when it's unprofitable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600595</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;in terms of invention, sailors had been wearing bell bottoms since the US Navy introduced them 1817 and sailors tromping around seaport cities would have been more of an every day event through WWII. That US Navy uniform is informally called "Cracker Jacks"https://www.shopthesalvationarmy.com/Listing/Details/2645572...They were intended to allow sailors to roll their pants up above the knee while swabbing the deckshttps://www.wearethemighty.com/mighty-trending/this-is-why-t...But we can see "bell bottomed trousers" referenced in popular culture in the 1940's, here's Louis Prima's band doing the song Bell Bottomed Trousershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QXmdbc5sx0and here's a painting used for the sheet musichttps://fineartamerica.com/featured/bell-bottom-trousers-alb...https://www.ecrater.com/p/42407644/vintage-1944-bell-bottom-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Caserta&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great piece.  This subculture has been overanalyzed to death, but the early roots were very humble indeed, and the spirit of entrepreneurship this woman possessed was quite real and strong.  Circumstances and tragedy unfortunately short-circuited her trajectory, yet she made a lasting impact, and it seems she found grace in her stride again through her final chapters.My parents had at least one Janis Joplin record and each dipped their toes into the hippie scene, so I was aware of it early on.  Bell-bottom jeans were reviled by many in my early youth - including me - but by the time I was in high school, I started to see the appeal in more than one way.  I helped create a fake video news report on Woodstock as part of some kind of A/V class.  I took acid.  I listened to the Grateful Dead tapes a friend had acquired through the still robust tape-trading scene going at the time (incidentally, some of my favorite background music lately has been some instrumental-only jam collections posted by gratefuldeadosaurusrex on YT, check it out if you're so inclined).Only a tiny percentage of baby boomers were actually significantly involved in hippie culture, even during its height.  Like nearly everything truly special, it got overblown.  Despite its exaggerated presence and oft-deserved mixed reception, though, there was something important about it.  There's a reason so many keep going back to take another look.  I think it's wise for some of us to continue sifting through the remnants to find what's worth holding on to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42569880</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses implementing long polling in a Node.js application using PostgreSQL as the database. It explains the concept of long polling, which allows a server to hold a request open until new data is available, enhancing real-time communication by reducing the number of requests needed. The piece provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up the environment, configure PostgreSQL for polling, and write the necessary Node.js code to handle incoming requests while interacting with the database. It emphasizes performance considerations and offers insights on optimizing the solution for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long polling has some problems of its own.Second Life has an HTTPS long polling channel between client and server. It's used for some data that's too bulky for the UDP connection, not too time sensitive, or needs encryption. This has caused much grief.On the client side, the poller uses libcurl. Libcurl has timeouts. If the server has nothing to send for a while, libcurl times out. The client then makes the request again.
This results in a race condition if the server wants to send something between timeout and next request. Messages get lost.On top of that, the real server is front-ended by an Apache server. This just passes through relevant requests, blocking the endless flood of junk HTTP requests from scrapers, attacks, and search engines. Apache has a timeout, and may close a connection that's in a long poll and not doing anything.Additional trouble can come from middle boxes and proxy servers that don't like long polling.There are a lot of things out there that just don't like holding an HTTP connection open. Years ago, a connection idle for a minute was fine. Today, hold a connection open for ten seconds without sending any data and something is likely to disconnect it.The end result is an unreliable message channel. It has to have sequence numbers to detect duplicates, and can lose messages. For a long time, nobody had discovered that, and there were intermittent failures that were not understood.In the original article, the chart section labelled "loop" doesn't mention timeout handling. That's not good.
If you do long polling, you probably need to send something every few seconds to keep the connection alive.
Not clear what a safe number is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Articles like this make me happy to use Phoenix and LiveView every day. My app uses WebSockets and I don’t think about them at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrelated to the topic in the article…    await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 500));

In Node.js context, it's easier to:    import { setTimeout } from "node:timers/promises";
    await setTimeout(500);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600276</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For instance, compared to an EUV system employing a 250-watt light source, Canon estimates NIL consumes just one-tenth the energy.I'm not an expert on this but feel like a 250w light is not the major driver of cost in EUV? Or am I misunderstanding this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had many experiments with nanoimprint lithography at the university 20 years ago. The resolution was poor and the durability very poor. After dozens of imprints the “stamps” degraded heavily. I am curious if 20 years were enough to fix all the issues and it’s really competitive today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP states that this can go down to 14nm. What I am interested in is whether older and larger processes (say ~50nm) can be done at a much cheaper cost than traditional methods.A lot of stuff simply does not require the most advanced chips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42575111</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I played around with this in a VM the last time it was mentioned on HN.The thing I want to do, but wasn't able to find a way to accomplish was to have a virtual desktop switcher gadget and a separate gadget to swallow minimized applications where each can be placed independently on the screen (and preferably auto hide)-- this will be separate application(s) from Labwc, but I did not find anything for Wayland that could do this (I do not like the MS Windows style task bar with menus, desktop switcher, etc., in one single bar).Anyone have any suggestions?Another nice to have would be to have screen edge bindings, where moving the mouse pointer or dragging a window over an edge, or corner, of the screen can be made to take an action. I'm not sure if this could even be accomplished with a stand-alone utility under Wayland, or if this must be done by the compositor.  But, if possible, and anyone knows of something that exists, I am all ears.One of the things I liked with labwc is that you can have traditional X style application menus by right-click/left-clicking the root window (it is not the default, but was easy to setup).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; it cannot be controlled with dbus, sway/i3-IPC or other technology. The reason for this is that we believe that custom IPCs and protocols create a fragmentation that hinders general Wayland adoption.If anything, this leads to more fragmentation since now you have to hack your own way to control it, rather than using something standard (at least on Linux) like dbus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is also wayboxhttps://github.com/wizbright/wayboxGlad these 2 projects exist since I would want fvwm (prefered) or a fluxbox clone under wayland when I am forced to move&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42597283</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now, we have to get a little philosophical here. In my eyes, RE is like a game of minesweeper. You start with an empty field not knowing the state of any of the cells, i.e. not knowing whether each individual cell contains a landmine or not. When you discover the state of a cell, you have the context to deduce the state of its neighbor cells. In minesweeper, you don’t have a particular direction in which you progress. You never say “In this game of minesweeper, I want to go up no matter what”, you just let the numbers nudge you in the direction that is the easiest to go in at the moment. I assert that this is also true for RE. Once you find out what a function or a variable does, you suddenly understand a little more about functions and variables that depend on the ones whose meaning you’ve just inferred. It may be beneficial not to set any particular goal with an RE project, and instead letting the complex network of intertwined functions and variables guide you towards understanding the system as a whole.That's such a nice way to think about it. Maybe I should try giving RE a go again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great project, write-up, and sense of humor in the videos!&gt; Using that part number I wasn’t able to find any information about the chip online apart from an article that claimed it was based around a “SuperH” CPU core – an ISA that I’ve encountered for the first time ever in that article.Also found in Sega 32x, Sega Saturn, and Sega Dreamcast! And some early Pocket PCs (turn-of-the-century handhelds running Windows CE) like the HP Jornada series, although most Pocket PCs were ARM-based.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such a ludicrous premise, I'm amazed you pulled it off.You mention "another packing optimization". I'm wondering, how are you transferring frames? The dot matrix is eight 7x5 characters, i.e. 280 bits in total, which amounts to 40 7-bit groups per frame. You seem to be using twice that space in transmission, is it wasted on some control data or is the transmission just slightly suboptimal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600349</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ownership of copyrights in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the implications of different ownership structures. It highlights various perspectives on who should hold copyright—individual developers, organizations, or the community—and examines the potential impact on software development, licensing, and access. The piece argues for a balanced approach that considers the rights and motivations of contributors while ensuring the sustainability and accessibility of FOSS projects. It also addresses the legal complexities and encourages further dialogue on copyright ownership in the FOSS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580397"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who wants GPL enforcement, I still say don't sign a CLA, for two reasons:- Centralizing copyright ownership in a single entity grants that entity the ability to lock down the project at any time and defeat the copyleft (e.g. Oracle killing off OpenSolaris). I consider this a worse outcome than a copyleft that is unenforced. It also encourages malicious enforcement (e.g. Oracle v. Google) that runs contrary to the goals of FOSS.- Due to some very specific peculiarities of US law, regular users can sue companies that don't follow the GPL, because the source code disclosure requirement makes you a third-party beneficiary of the copyright license (which in US law is a contract).The last one is a bit unfair to the article because the rulings in question happened after it was published. But it obviates the biggest benefit of centralized ownership - clear and unambiguous standing to sue. If things were the opposite - i.e. the courts said third-party beneficiaries can't sue and only owners can - then there would be an argument for keeping ownership of critical parts of the project in an entity with no conflict of interest against enforcement.Even then, I don't see why ownership has to be centralized. Under US law, joint owners of a single copyrighted work both have standing to sue. Having more owners means more people with standing. In lieu of a classic CLA with a single point of failure, you could have a policy of accepting any code that is either owned by the developer itself (after their employment contracts have been vetted) or any of a number of trustworthy FOSS organizations who are committed to enforcing GPL. All parties would have standing to sue individually and could additionally sue as a class in a single action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My new rule is to never contribute and do my best to avoid using any free software that requires a CLA. Shared copyright ownership is very important to maintaining software freedoms. It makes it impossible for a single party to change the license in ways counter to the communities desires. There have been many recent examples of this sort of bad behavior that have driven this point home for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When you take a job, in most places in the world, by default, your employer owns and/or effectively controls all your copyrights.Is this really true? I haven't checked my employment agreement, but I'm pretty sure that my employer only controls the copyrights for a) work I do for them, and b) any other side work I happen to do in my employer's field (which never happens).AFAIK, work I do on my own that is unrelated to my employer belongs to me, and I've never had anyone from my job try to assert otherwise. (I have plenty of publicly-visible code on GitHub that they could glom onto if they wanted, although none of it is commercially important.)---Edit: My employee agreement says "I understand that the 
provisions this Agreement requiring assignment of Company Work Product do not apply to any Non-Company Work Product that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, or any similar state invention law."That labor code says "Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the 
employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the 
employer."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580397</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Blur Busters Open Source Display Initiative, which aims to improve the clarity of motion on LCD displays through the use of refresh cycle shaders. These shaders address the issues of motion blur and ghosting that can occur during fast-moving scenes. By utilizing techniques like variable refresh rates and backlight strobing, the initiative seeks to create a more visually pleasing experience for gamers and viewers alike. The website also emphasizes community collaboration and open-source development to drive innovation in display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it some elaborate joke?Don't visual effects people go to lots of effort to add motion blur? Why would you want to remove it?Why are they trying to simulate old CRT displays?Can someone explain what this is about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So this a new method that simulates a CRT and genuinely reduces motion blur on any type of higher framerate displays, starting a 120hz. But it doesn't dim the image like black frame insertion which is the only current method that comes close to the clarity of a CRT. But it also simulates other aspects of CRT displays, right?Can you use this method just to reduce blur without reducing brightness, on any game? They mention reducing blur for many things other than retro games in "Possible Use Cases of Refresh Cycle Shaders" but does reducing blur in a flight simulator also make it visually look like a CRT with phosphors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With about half of the screen is black, can it also boost FPS by not  spending GPU time on pixels in those areas if integrated deep into engine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599696</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study on the effectiveness of AI-generated spear phishing emails. It details an experiment where participants were targeted with emails created with the help of artificial intelligence, comparing their responses to those generated by humans. The findings reveal that AI-generated phishing campaigns can be highly effective, with a significant portion of participants engaging with the emails. The study emphasizes the increasing sophistication of AI in crafting deceptive communications and highlights the importance of developing better defenses against such threats to improve cybersecurity awareness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a purchase yesterday from Meta (Oculus). A few minutes after payment, I received an email asking to click to confirm it was me.It came from verify@verification.metamail.com, with alert@nofraud.com cc. All red flags for phishing.I googled it because it had all the purchase information, so unless a malicious actor infiltrated Meta servers, it has to be right. And it was, after googling a bit. But why do they do such things?i would expect better from Meta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That, after thirty years, email security still depends on the wisdom of individuals not clicking the wrong link, is appalling.The situation involves institutions happy to opaque links to email as part of their workflow. What could change this? All I can imagine is state regulation but that also is implausible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This lines up well with the success rates I have seen from expert phishers. When I worked at a certain well known company with strong security, a demon called Karla would succeed at spearphishing a bit over 50% of the security team.AI now means much less skilled people can be as good as she was. Karla as a Service. We are doomed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601681</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent scientific discovery regarding comb jellies, which are capable of fusing with one another to create a single organism, effectively merging their bodies and genetic material. Researchers have found that this unique behavior may provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of multicellularity. The study highlights how this fusion process allows comb jellies to adapt and thrive in their environments, raising questions about the implications for understanding other biological systems and the evolution of complex life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes me think of a few follow-up questions:- Since we know that fusion happens to damaged jellies, do they remain permanently fused? Or do they eventually grow back the missing parts and split up again?- If they do split up again, do both individuals wait for the other one to completely heal before splitting? If one side started off less damaged and healed faster, can it abandon/reject the other side without waiting for the other side to completely heal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant if you like these creatures, an article on how an aquarium managed to raise them: https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/stories/growing-jellies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better understanding of the mechanisms of allorecognition would be huge for transplant surgeries.For people trying to decide between death and transplant, possibly being able to tune down human-twitchy self identification would be amazing.To say nothing of those with autoimmune disorders, most of which have horrific symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564243</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses techniques for intercepting system calls (syscalls) in operating systems, particularly focusing on the use of software tools and debugging utilities to modify or monitor the behavior of applications at the syscall level. It covers various methods such as using `ptrace`, `LD_PRELOAD`, and custom kernel modules to intercept and manage syscalls, while also addressing the security implications and potential use cases for these techniques, including debugging, profiling, and enhancing application performance. The author provides practical examples and insights into the architecture of syscalls, emphasizing the importance of understanding these low-level operations for developers and security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've looked into using Seccomp for this before for sandboxing. It was kind of a mess. Very awkward to work with. Especially for syscalls where the information you want isn't directly in the parameters - e.g. for strings. You have to do some crazy stuff to make that work.Especially annoying because it only supports cBPF (Classic BPF) which is very limited compared to eBPF. Apparently they aren't ever going to add eBPF to more things since it is such a security risk.You may want to look into this if your use-case is not security sensitive: https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/syscall-user-dispatch.ht...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602603</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant breakthrough in hacking the Raspberry Pi RP2350, where a hacker successfully accessed the one-time programmable (OTP) secret by exploiting glitches in the RISC-V cores, which allowed them to enable debugging capabilities. This accomplishment raises concerns regarding the security of the RP2350, as it showcases vulnerabilities that can be exploited, highlighting the ongoing challenges in protecting hardware from sophisticated hacking techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599971"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was a cool talk. The attacker used a well timed glitch on voltage supply pin shared by the USB peripheral and OTP (one time programable) memory which unlike the CPU power isn't protected by hardware glitch detectors. Instead the BootROM code does multiple validating reads to both known test values and the configuration bits. The glitch is timed to allow the test values to be read, but cuts power while reading the configuration bits. This causes test value to persist.It jus happens that the test value represents an invalid, but useful, configuration (both ARM and RISC-V cores disabled). The chip power on state machine boots the RISC-V cores in this case instead of hanging the start-up sequence. Since the RISC-V cores don't have a secure enclave mode their debug interface is always accessible if a RISC-V core is selected.The chip reset state machine is also partly under the control of software, because it's used to wakeup the chip from deep sleep modes. So the RISC-V cores (or their debug interface) can be used enable the ARM debug interface and perform a partial reset from beyond the point the state machine would disable the ARM debug interface, but early enough to reset everything else.It's my understanding there can be no pure software fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a repost of the 38C3 talk by Aedan Cullen:https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-hacking-the-rp2350Aedan references a presentation earlier on Day 1 of 38C3 about hardware fault injection of the ACE3 USB-C controller in Apple hardware: https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-ace-up-the-sleeve-hacking-into-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is wrong. The author glitched the IP block with the one time programmable fuses in conjunction with logic that uses those fuse bits, not the RISC-V cores themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599971</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses "Wildcard," a project created by Geoffrey Litt, designed to help individuals and teams embrace uncertainty and leverage it for creative problem-solving. It introduces a structured approach to generate unconventional ideas using a card-based system, encouraging users to think outside traditional boundaries. The concept aims to foster innovation and adaptability in various scenarios by allowing participants to explore diverse perspectives and develop unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creator of Wildcard here! Neat to see this pop up on HN after several years. As others have noted, this project isn't under active development anymore.One reason: while I still think there's great potential in browser extensions, I ultimately felt limited by scraping and fetching bits of data from a server, and grew more interested in a deeper overhaul of how we build applications in order to locate more data on the client. Eg: check out this demo [1] of a Wildcard-esque data manipulation but in an app that stores all its data in a client-side database. I'm still continuing this work today, exploring "local-first" architectures at the Ink &amp; Switch research lab, in support of malleable customizable interfaces.It would be interesting to revisit Wildcard now that LLMs exist—I suspect that many of the scraping parts (building "site adapters" in Wildcard parlance) would be far more possible to automate now. A few years ago we explored some semi-automated programming-by-example interactions for scraping [2] but the friction was always really noticeable without any AI support.[1]: https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/#data-centric-design-e...[2]: https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/Joker-LIVE-2022.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! Seems that development has stopped in 2020 though :-( https://github.com/geoffreylitt/wildcard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the idea of having a plug-in spreadsheet on every website, so I can work with the data without having to do any scraping or programming.Unfortunately, it looks like the project was abandoned after the initial talk and paper in 2020.I assume that we'll get there soon with small LLMs running directly in the browser (like Gemini nano) that will make it easy to query/structure website data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585447</guid></item><item><title>27.

For example, PSN is now being handled by Tencent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; All current China CDN customers must complete the transition to our Partners’ solution by June 30, 2026...Can anyone here who works in the field shed some light on why it takes a whole 1.5 years for such a change to take effect?What's involved in a CDN transition that can't be done in, say, 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603585</guid></item><item><title>28.

I ultimately opted to use Leptos on top of it, so I don't really use it directly at this point. But it's neat.For a long time, I used PHP and JS/TS for web projects. Now I'm using Rust with Axum/Tokio/Tower/Hyper (web server), Leptos (SSR using "Islands" flag, which also allows WASM generation for front end; JSX-like syntax), and Diesel (ORM and query builder that expects you define your schema using raw SQL).

&lt;p&gt;The article details the evolution of tunnel boring machines (TBMs), highlighting their historical development, technological advancements, and various designs used in construction projects. It discusses early tunneling methods, the introduction of mechanized tunneling in the mid-20th century, and the transition to more sophisticated, efficient TBMs that enhance safety and productivity in tunnel construction. Additionally, the article examines different types of TBMs, such as earth pressure balance and slurry shield machines, and their applications in various geological conditions, showcasing the impact of TBMs on infrastructure development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite TBMs being used all the time it is genererally much cheaper to build a tunnel by cut and cover - that is  just call in excovators and dig a hole then cover it. when an excavator breaks you push it aside and get another until it is fixed. Want to go faster - just hire more excavators the overall cost is the same since you are done faster.tbms are cheaper if you must go deep, but deep is a negative for subways since people must get down which takes time (faster is always better).It is claimed that cut and cover is toa much surface disruption - but cut and cover is much faster and so the disruption to any one place can be quick enough. Better to manage disruption than eliminate it.when a tbm breaks your project is delayed while you wait for parts and then fix it in place.Tbms do go under everything else, but experience proves you can find things and go around them quick enough (sometimes there is a delay as somethingeof archeological interest is found - but evperience shows this is still cheaper than a TBM.Yes TBMs are cool and useful but the simple shoud not be over looked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to mention a recent extension to Berlin‘s subway system right in the middle of the city, in swampy ground and below a canal. They injected „freeze lances“ into the ground, turned 43,000 m^3 of mud into an ice block and then carved their way through it. Absolutely amazing engineering, I think planned and executed by a Swiss company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it doesn’t seem to be mentioned here, but has there been some major recent change in the economics of the _scale_ of the tunnels? Dublin’s beleaguered metro project recently put out its new design; there are a bunch of changes from the previous early-noughties design, but one of the more eyebrow-raising ones is that the bored sections will now be a single _9.5 meter diameter_ tunnel; it is claimed that this is less disruptive and cheaper than the two-narrow-tunnel approach used in conventional bored metros. Recent metro lines is Barcelona and Madrid have also used the single-giant-tunnel approach.Anyone know what’s going on here? Intuitively you’d expect two small tunnels to be cheaper; you’re moving a lot less material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600979</guid></item><item><title>30.

I followed the math in this comment that is now only viewable from the archive http://web.archive.org/web/20190614093605/https://forum.libc...I notice you use 4 triangles per segment but I believe it's always possible to use only 2 if you only have miter and bevel caps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used something close to this to implement a whiteboard marker with texture and transparency. If your browser supports WebGL, feel free to try https://limnu.com/d/new.html (BTW It’s a multi-player whiteboard you can share &amp; collab.) Is that a shameless plug? I’m not involved anymore and won’t make any money, but I’m proud of the implementation, and happy if the current stewards of the site get some traffic or business.Aside from that, for the sake of discussion and playing devil’s advocate I’ll take a small pedantic issue with the very first sentence. There are multiple ways to do this kind of thing without triangulating. (And I’m currently working on making one available publicly.) Clever shaders are one way to render lines without triangles. Ray tracing is another. Triangles are useful and easy and have broad support, so they make sense, but they aren’t the only option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42589054</guid></item><item><title>32. 60 Years of Spaceflight Patches</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how sailor poets are reclaiming U.S. Navy deck logs by infusing them with creativity and artistic expression on New Year's Day. It highlights the initiative to transform these typically formal and factual records into platforms for personal stories and poetry, allowing sailors to share their experiences and connect with one another in a unique way. The movement aims to celebrate the individuality of sailors while maintaining the integrity of the official logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses essential practices for enhancing home server security, emphasizing the importance of protecting personal data and ensuring safe connectivity. It covers key topics such as regularly updating software, configuring firewalls, implementing strong password policies, and using encryption for sensitive data. The author also highlights the significance of monitoring server activity and setting up backup systems to prevent data loss. Overall, the post serves as a guide for individuals looking to secure their home server against potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docker has a known security issue with port exposure in that it punches holes through the firewall without asking your permission, see https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737I usually expose ports like `127.0.0.1:1234:1234` instead of `1234:1234`. As far as I understand, it still punches holes this way but to access the container, an attacker would need to get a packet routed to the host with a spoofed IP SRC set to `127.0.0.1`. All other solutions that are better seem to be much more involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "None of the database guides I followed had warned me about the dangers of exposing a docker containerized database to the internet."This prompts a reflection about, as an industry, we should make a better job in providing solid foundations.When I check tutorials on how to drill in the wall, there is (almost) no warning about how I could lose a finger doing so. It is expected that I know I should be careful around power tools.How do we make some information part of the common sense? "Minimize the surface of exposure on the Internet" should be drilled in everyone, but we are clearly not there yet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tailscale is a great solution for this problem. I too run homeserver with Nextcloud and other stuff, but protected behind Tailscale (Wireguard) VPN. I can't even imagine exposing something like my family's personal data over internet, no matter how convenient it is.But I sympathize with OP. He is not a developer and it is sad that whatever software engineers produce is vulnerable to script kiddies. Exposing database or any server with a good password should not be exploitable in any way. C and C++ has been failing us for decades yet we continue to use such unsafe stacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601374</guid></item><item><title>37.

I did a similar project last year. Really like how your result looks with the lighting setting on.The most interesting results I got were from having multiple "variants" and giving each variant parameters for their attraction to agents of their own/other type. Implementation-wise it was a variant tag for each agent and a matrix of attraction coefficients as a uniform. Playing with the params resulted in interesting behaviors, like one variant chasing another around while they both try to avoid a third.If you're looking for an addition to this project, I'd recommend giving it a try!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super cool! I was experimenting with WebGPU and various simulations a couple months ago [1] and would love to learn more about your process!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of quarantine on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and the broader Python community. It reflects on the challenges faced during this period, including managing package stability and security, and the importance of community collaboration in addressing these issues. The piece emphasizes the need for clear communication and the role of maintainers in ensuring the ecosystem remains robust. It also highlights lessons learned and strategies for moving forward to strengthen package management and community support.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its always an interesting dynamic: assuming a high trust society pays dividends - Python would be nowhere close the success it has been without PyPI.But then success attracts trust abusers and forces raising the fences (which comes with higher costs, both direct and indirect).Direct costs in the people and infrastructure that must be dedicated to the task. Indirect costs in the frictions generated by complicating workflows.It all points to the need for open source ecosystems to be taken more seriously by the economically able users who most benefit from this amazing development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The still don't even have a way to avoid dependency confusion attacks when using private package repos (other than also registering every single private package name you use on pypi.org). Blows my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The one project cleared was a project containing obfuscated code, in violation of the PyPI Acceptable Use Policy.Interesting, I didn’t know that. While I haven’t released anything obfuscated on PyPI, I’ve certainly written Python projects that include obfuscated code by necessity, namely scrapers packing duktape (embedded JS interpreter) and third party obfuscated JS blobs to generate signatures and stuff. I know for a fact there are projects like that on PyPI. I wonder if those are allowed.(Come to think of it, those probably can be DMCAed if the targeted service provider is sufficiently motivated.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577938</guid></item><item><title>39.

There are a lot of barriers. It starts with our education system where people need to be in school until they are far too old until they reach the edge of the state of the art. I think it's time to rethink parts of high school and university so that people can specialize in this area sooner. Funding is another major hurdle. A lot of traditional sources of funding don't map well to these problem areas where the risk and reward are both very high and the holding periods are long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Link to Nature publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07559-x&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating advancement with HORNET for RNA structure visualization!

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Maritime Approximation" by Kevlin Henney explores the concept of approximations in software development, drawing parallels with maritime navigation. It discusses how approximations are necessary in both fields due to uncertainties and variabilities, emphasizing that perfect solutions are often unattainable. Henney highlights the importance of understanding context, using appropriate models, and being comfortable with accepting and managing imprecision in order to navigate complex problems effectively. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a pragmatic approach to approximation, encouraging software developers to adopt flexible methods that accommodate change and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

In the rest of the world, we use the metric maritime approximation,π * φ km = e nm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;historically, maritime navigation has always required much higher precision since a small error compounds into missing an island entirely. 
land-based measurements could afford to be fuzzier because you can course-correct using visible landmarks. this is also why maritime measurements standardized globally much earlier than land measurements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574600</guid></item><item><title>41.

This method, known as "bioprinting," allows for the layer-by-layer construction of complex tissue structures, which could advance regenerative medicine and the development of organ grafts. The technique aims to improve healing processes and may lead to significant improvements in transplant medicine by enabling the creation of organs tailored to individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Most PON networks do not use the ONU as a method of deciding which service the user should receive. This is instead usually defined by the PPPOE session and the characteristics sent by the RADIUS server. Having zero upstream authentication beyond an ONU serial number, if that, is poor and unusual network design.If you’d like to understand more about good Ethernet based broadband network design, you should read the reference standard TR-101. This evolved from TR-099 which was the old ATM/ADSL standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/Anime4000/RTL960xThe article reminds me this Github project, which using 3rd party SFP ONU connecting internet with SLID, Model, SN and other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I shined a laser pointer through the fiber in my house, would I DOS my neighbors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42599507</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know I think a lot of the problems is we are looking for magic when it is dull and boring around us. If all else fails, just stay at the surface and say everything is as it seems and nothing is deep or dramatic, and do nothing else but your eisenhower matrix (what’s important and urgent first, four squares on a two axis box). Because when we say nothing is magical we stop looping internally trying to find a touch of divinity when what we need is to interact with the world in a structured way to build momentum to change our environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;imo depression is a physical circumstance that selects its own downstream psychology. I don't think you can talk or reason out of depression without a radical reframing that causes your physical behavior and circumstances to change. your body and its habits create preferences for psychological intensity, which gets it hits of feelings it would get normally if the being that inhabited it were free and self accepting.the self or ego speaks language, and the therapist's demeanour is intended to create a physical peace where the self can run and exhaust itself before becoming receptive to a (hopefully constructive) reframing. where I diverge from my psychologist friends is I think using language to relieve the suffering of the being only works accidentally, or when some language can overflow the self and unseat it from its dominion of the being. there's a state of enlightened duality where you can see your thoughts without feeling them or being directed by them, much like what meditation recommends, and from that state the being literally just chooses experiencies that bring it peace or joy. sustaining that is an effort and skill that can developed with practice and exercise.trying to reconcile the symbols and artifacts of language with other symbols and artifacts of language is a treadmill to me. how's that working out? couldn't say precisely, but wisdom is shown to be right by its results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sex and the City saved me from a lifetime wasted with self-help books by one wonderful scene of some pathetic lady crying in the self-help section on the floor.  It made me realize that is pretty much every self-help reader ever.  They are never helped, they are just on a hamster wheel to the next self-help book, a little of their wallet moved from their pocket to the author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580342</guid></item><item><title>45.

Then they can start blocking the ads of people who don't pay.The user, who pays for the service, is getting no value out of the ads and the advertiser is freeloading the ISP's technical infrastructure and userbase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising they don't mention what I imagine has to be the obvious culprit: video ads.It's not even about advertising for me -- static ads don't bother me that much. But whenever there's autoplaying video in the corner of a page, I hate it so much. Whether it's an ad, or a news site that inexplicably thinks I want to multitask and watch their news channel at the same time I read their article. It's genuinely hard to read the article when there's constant motion an inch or two away at all times!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of web pages only work for me on my iPhone if I use reader mode. Otherwise, the page keeps resetting over and over again. Firefox, but I assume Safari is probably the same, since Apple mandates they all be based on WebKit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602673</guid></item><item><title>46.

But then I clicked onto the site, and things did a 180, based on the edgy marketing copy on the landing page I don't think this is the site I'm looking for, as 'normie' as that might make me.&gt; There’s plenty of dating apps out there: Tinder, Bumble, OkCupid, Boo, Hinge. We think they’re all great apps... For normies! But a terminally-online meme-enjoying degenerate like yourself needs something more. That’s why we invented Duolicious!&gt; Duolicious is the dating app that helps you find your Discord-lurking, Reddit-updooting, Nigerian-basketweaving-forum-posting, chronically-online soulmate. Our fun personality quiz helps you meet like-minded people, and shows you a new match for every answer you give, thanks to our fancy matching algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What’s the gender ratio on Duolicious?&gt; Right now the ratio of active men to women is 7.32:1. The ratio can change a lot, depending on which online communities have been talking about Duolicious lately; The ratio’s previously been as high as about 20:1.Admitting this was brave.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42605740</guid></item><item><title>47. 1972 Mercedes-Benz 600 Kompressor [video]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LnHdWgLlFI</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always been into vintage Mercedes-Benz cars.A talented and wonderfully jovial mechanic ran a specialist workshop east of Johannesburg, in Brakpan (South Africa).For a long time he had a Mercedes 600 - similar to the linked video but with the M100 engine naturally-aspirated as standard - in the shop.That particular car, finished in a cream colour, belonged to Ian Smith (1919-2007), the last colonial prime minister of Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe.I got to spend a lot of time with the car, including several drives in it, and especially seeing the mechanical bits exposed including the ridiculously cool (silent, powerful) hydraulics that operated every convenience of this car, from power windows to power back seat.While a Mercedes 600 indeed screams "head of state" or "pope" it gets my vote for the all-time, no-holds-barred, most opulent and classy car of all time with absolutely nothing kitsch or gangsta about it.A true high point of what Mercedes-Benz once was.And don't get me started on it's little brother, the W109 300SEL 6.3, of which there was a lovely example in the shop for a few months as well. It drove and operated perfectly, I had the most amazing solo test drive in that car, taking it to 200km/h.This was in 2003, and the 300SEL 6.3 was for sale for $3,000 and Ian Smith's 600 was about $12,000.God if only I had the money then! I wonder where both of those rarities, sitting in a small workshop in the East Rand in South Africa, ended up at. Probably exported to Europe or the USA.Anyway, just wanted to share that small anecdote.P.S. The Chrome, Leather, and craftsmanship of a Mercedes 600 is far beyond any Rolls or Bentley, of that or any other period. And Mercedes vehicles of that era were made to last decades and hundreds of thousands of miles down to every detail including all the rubber parts. The disposable garbage churned out in the 21st century simply fuel man's insane behaviour to constantly buy, consume, discard.There was a time when cars were made for a different modality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of notable owner is long."Josip Broz Tito, who owned four 1965 LWB 6-door Pullmans, one of which was armoured, and two LWB Pullman landaulets, acquired in 1971 and 1978 respectively (both of these were of the very-rare type where the folding parade roof extends to cover 2/3rds of the vehicle top, only 9 were made with such a roof arrangement and 6 doors, and Tito was the only statesman in the world at the time who had two such cars)."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_600&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydraulic power windows?? In doors?Man, I had enough trouble bleeding a hydraulic clutch properly, and that line was maybe 30 inches tops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579682</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents a preprint research study focused on examining the relationship between various psychological constructs, particularly regarding mental health and well-being. The study utilizes quantitative methods to analyze data and aims to provide insights into the factors that influence psychological outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these relationships to inform therapeutic practices and interventions, contributing to the broader field of psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although mildly interesting, this doesn't really explore some of the more interesting dynamics of online conversation. There was a theory over in one borderline famous reddit post that most online conversations were various factions of people who were borderline mentally ill talking to each other. Boiling the situation down to a bell curve over one axis is really underselling the amount of distortion that can take place - the moderate opinion might literally not be hinted at in an online conversation.But the effect the paper hints at is real. I remember being noting with curiosity that Factorio's positive reviews vs Steam's game stats for their recent expansion and noting that the reviews must have been  done by people who probably hadn't seen the expansion's content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if researchers are simply failing to frame the problem.It might not be that the perception of norms are distorted. It's just that communities are entirely different and insulated, and thus as communities go they organically develop their own norms.This failure in perception also communicates a bias that a specific norm should be the reigning one and anything that differs from it is "distorted". This reads like last century's inherent racism in sociology, anthropology, and even linguistics, where anything that contrasted with the old country's baseline was labelled as distortions and errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the more stunning examples of Figure 1 from the paper in the wild in recent times is the discrepancy between the "consensus" on social media that the assassination of a certain healthcare CEO was justified, versus public opinion polling showing this to be a minority opinion among Americans.[0][1][0] https://stratpolitics.org/2024/12/unitedhealthcare-poll/[1] https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-pol...(The demographic breakdown in the second poll pretty starkly demonstrates as well how the sort of uneven sample of the population you typically see on places like reddit can give you a very distorted impression of public opinion.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600626</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to create a web crawler that is both polite and efficient. It emphasizes the importance of respecting website rules, such as robots.txt, to avoid overloading servers and being banned. The author outlines best practices for crawling, including managing request rates, handling retries for failed requests, and adhering to crawl delays. Additionally, it addresses the need for proper user-agent identification to inform webmasters about the crawler's presence, and it provides insights on efficiently storing and processing the retrieved data. Overall, the article serves as a guide for developing web crawlers that operate responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a default max of 1 request every 5 seconds is unnecessarily meek, especially for larger sites. I'd also argue that requests that browsers don't slow down for, like following redirects to the same domain or links with the prefetch attribute, don't really necessitate a delay at all.If you can detect a site has a CDN, metrics like time-to-first-byte are low and stable and/or you're getting cache control headers indicating you're mostly getting cached pages, I see no reason why one shouldn't speed up - at least for domains with millions of URLs.I disagree with using HEAD requests for refreshing. A HEAD request is rarely cheaper and sometimes more expensive for some websites than a GET If-Modified-Since/If-None-Match. Besides, you're going to fetch the page anyway if it changed, so why issue two requests when you could do one?Having a single crawler per process/thread makes rate limiting easier, but it can lead to some balancing and under-utilization issues with distributed crawling due to the massive variation in URLs per domain and site speeds, especially if you use something like a hash to distribute them. For Commoncrawl, I had something that monitored utilization and  shut down crawler instances which would redistribute URLs pending from the machines shutting down to the machines left (we were doing it on a shoestring budget using AWS spot instances, so it had to survive instances going down randomly anyway).I'd say one of the best polite things to do when crawling is to add a URL to the crawler user agent pointing to a page explaining what it is and maybe letting people opt-out or explain how to update their robots.txt to let them out-out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've done crawling at a small startup and I've done crawling at a big tech company. This is not crawling more politely than big tech.There are a few things that stand out, like:&gt;  I fetch all robots.txts for given URLs in parallel inside the queue's enqueue function.Could this end up DOS'ing or being "impolite" just in robots.txt requests?All of this logic is per-domain, but nothing mentioned about what constitutes a domain. If this is naive, it could easily end up overloading a server that uses wildcard subdomains to serve its content, like Substack having each blog on a separate subdomain.When I was at a small startup doing crawling, the main thing our partners wanted from us was a maximum hit rate (varied by partner). We typically promised fewer than 1 request per second, which would never cause perceptible load, and was usually sufficient for our use-case.Here at $BigTech, the systems for ensuring "polite", and policy-compliant crawling (robots.txt etc) are more extensive than I could possibly have imagined before coming here.It doesn't surprise me that OpenAI and Amazon don't have great systems for this, both are new to the crawling world, but concluding that "Big Tech" doesn't do polite crawling is a bit of a stretch, given that search engines are most likely doing the best crawling available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have cache headers, why use HEAD? Are servers more likely to handle HEAD correctly than including them on the GET?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42570010</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who lost around 50,000 in the terra/luna collapse, I do believe a lot of it is on Do Kwon. He was the one that kept the Anchor flywheel at unsustainably high APR, moved more UST to refill the reserves and so on. He also ignored warnings of a death spiral and continued with advertising unrealistic expectations.When the depeg happened, Do Kwon was front and center on making it sound like everything was under control, instead of damage control. And his creation of LUNA2 is even more of a joke for the people that lost money on this.Is it his fault that it collapsed? Maybe not directly, but he steered the boat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The figure "$40B" is bandied about uncritically in the press, but I gather this is the highest notional market cap of Terra/Luna, not a reflection of actual money (fiat) put in?By contrast, SBF of FTX fame was convicted of stealing $8.7B and ordered to restitute the amount to investors in USD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the SEC going to do with the $4.55B settlement?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42598604</guid></item><item><title>1.

As far as I can tell, it's fully custom-made for this game? Can't find any references to the characters online.https://stimulation-clicker.neal.fun/ sounds/true-crime.mp3 - it's hosted on Cloudflare, but even so I don't want to cost OP significant bandwidth, so join the two strings above for the direct link."Aww, he was all cat 'n tonic when he first saw her." An absolute classic. I would do anything to know more about how this came to exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I finished the game without cheating. I felt like a frog being slowly boiled (and it really does feel like you're boiling at the end). It's quite the journey...I love how everything here isn't even farfetched. It's just standard YouTube and TikTok content. The red notification bubbles were also a nice touch, I felt myself really drawn to those, and if I think back, I guess that's the earliest example I can recall of where these patterns all started: Facebook's little red notification bubble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, that was amazing. This is honestly a better piece of contemporary art (in terms of making you think about modern life and what is happening to our environment, the impact on ourselves, our kids, etc.) than most of what you might see at a fancy art gallery or a contemporary art museum in NYC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611536</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Doom: The Gallery Experience is an interactive virtual reality project that immerses players in a unique experience inspired by the classic game "Doom." This project creatively combines elements of exploration and art, allowing players to navigate through vibrant and abstract environments while engaging in gameplay reminiscent of the original Doom style. The experience emphasizes visually striking graphics and atmospheric sound design, aiming to transport players into a reimagined world that pays homage to the iconic game while providing a fresh perspective in the form of an artistic gallery setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in neural architecture search (NAS) methods, particularly focusing on a novel approach called the "Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Adaptivity" (ENAS-AD). It emphasizes the importance of adaptivity in optimizing the search process for neural network architectures, enhancing both performance and efficiency. The research presents theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations demonstrating how ENAS-AD can significantly reduce the search space and time required to identify high-performing architectures, thereby contributing to the broader field of automated machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Didn’t see it mentioned but good to know about: UCR matrix profile.The Matrix Profile is honestly one of the most underrated tools in the time series analysis space - it's ridiculously efficient. The killer feature is how it just works for finding motifs and anomalies without having to mess around with window sizes and thresholds like you do with traditional techniques. Solid across domains too, from manufacturing sensor data to ECG analysis to earthquake detection.https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use offset function in Prometheus to make an average of past weeks as a recording rule. We have a use in our systems that is very "seasonal" as in weekly cycles so I make an average of some metric (offset 1 week, 2 week, 3 week , 4 week/4) and I compare it to the current value of that metric. That way the alarms can be set day or night, weekday or weekend, and the thresholds are dynamic. It compares against an average of the day of the week, or time of the day.
There is someone in Gitlab that posted a more in depth explanation of this way of working.

[1]An aha moment for me was realizing that the way you can think of anomaly models working is that they’re effectively forecasting the next N steps, and then noticing when the actual measured values are “different enough” from the expected. This is simple to draw on a whiteboard for one signal but when it’s multi variate, pretty neat that it works.[1] https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609595</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The essay on htmx.org discusses the future of web development, highlighting the potential of htmx to enhance user experiences by enabling rich, dynamic interactions without heavy reliance on JavaScript frameworks. It argues for a simpler, more efficient approach to building web applications, focusing on server-driven UIs that leverage HTML and facilitate rapid development. The piece emphasizes the importance of progressive enhancement, maintainability, and the role of developers in shaping the web's future by reassessing their tools and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve just completed a port from HTMX to Hotwire (Stimulus, Turbo). HTMX is a great idea, but in my experience it’s a poor execution.It’s really quite buggy, in my experience it plays poorly with fundamental web and browser features (relative links are broken in at least 2 ways, I fixed a third way). One of the events just stopped working at all in the most recent release. The docs are lacking. And where it promises to let you write less JS, if you ever do need to write some JS you’re on your own in structuring that, and you’ll be fighting against HTMX (who gets to update the DOM, maintaining event handlers, etc).As a (brief) contributor to HTMX, I also feel like these issues were all inevitable. It’s a single 5k line file with 190 top level functions in it meaning it’s pretty impenetrable to get up to speed on. When proposing a bug fix the maintainers weren’t sure if it would have other consequences. Tests didn’t cover the functionality. I’ve been mostly a backend engineer in my career, and I empathise with not wanting the complexity of a modern frontend, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have some basic organisation of the code to make it approachable and more obvious whether changes will work or not.After porting to Turbo and Stimulus I have a more reliable code base, I have significantly less JavaScript, and I have a JS code base that much easier to reason about. I really wanted to like HTMX but the execution is not there. A focus on stability is a great fit for the project, but it’s most certainly not there yet and has quite a way to go in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ...you can use as much or as little of it as you like... Stability as a Feature... No New Features as a Feature...This is the way.Having lived the alternative, I won't consider building anything significant on top of an abstraction that doesn't credibly promise these.When the abstraction you've built on changes or fails, the thing you built breaks. When you choose an unstable abstraction, you're creating future bugs you'll have to spend future time on to resolve (and if it wraps the lower layer rather than sitting beside it, you have fewer options to fix them).These aren't concerns for things that will be short-lived, or are small enough to replace if needed. But I've seen plenty of small and temporary things turn into large and permanent things when they end up being useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've created a Django application using HTMX. Usually I'd jump to React or Vue. It was a great exercise and I can see where HTMX would be a great fit.1. If you consider yourself a "backend developer" only and want to write the minimum amount of JS/TS.2. If your application is simple. Yes you can do more complicated interactivity with oob swaps, but you end up with more complexity than you chose HTMX for.For my next projects, I will still use Django but with React/Vue for pieces that need interactivity. As an example in my HTMX app, I wanted to add a profile image uploader. Lots of great frontend libraries exist to resize / modify your image before even uploading it to your server.Finally, HTMX is just not testable the same way modern frontend libraries are. I've managed to write some decent tests using beautifulsoup, but it's night and day compared to vitest or jest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613221</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses kakizome, the traditional Japanese practice of writing the first calligraphy of the year, typically performed on January 2nd. It highlights the significance of this ritual in Japanese culture, symbolizing new beginnings and the setting of intentions or resolutions for the year ahead. The piece includes tips on how to prepare for kakizome, such as selecting appropriate materials and themes for the calligraphy, and emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and expression in the art form.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"元旦开笔"[1] The first writing of the New Year. Its a small ritual performed by ancient Chinese intellectuals on the first day of the New Year. It has a history of about 1,000 years. During the Qing Dynasty, the emperor's ceremony became more grand and lengthy, including writing words of blessing with ornate Chinese brushes, symbolically turning the pages of the New Year's calendar (in the early Qing Dynasty, European missionaries participated in the improvement of the traditional Chinese calendar) [2] and drinking from a golden cup symbolizing the eternal and unbreakable borders. Ironically, one of the golden cups was stolen by French invaders during the Second Opium War [3].[1] https://imagepphcloud.thepaper.cn/pph/image/114/965/140.jpg

[3] https://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMP/eMuseumPlus?se...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Few more fun facts:Elementary school students all write kakizome at the end of December. Within the school, each grade will write the exact same thing. They're hung in the halls for all to see. Hundreds of the exact same kakizome.Many people burn their kakizome mid-January during "Dondoyaki."The posture, attention and care taken while writing Kakizome is one of the important points. Those, and the outcome of the characters themselves, are all taken into account.Unrelated, but Japan's officaily chosen Kanji for the year 2024 was "金" which means gold, or money, or heck, even Friday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last year even though I didn’t have a theme, I made small changes in the way I live, tried to complete my 15 book goodreads challenge, started doing sports and improve myself professionally on my free time.This year started with pretty fundamental questions in the way I live and uncertainties about my future so deciding on a theme is very difficult. I can’t answer those questions and don’t know what I really want. I will try to put an effort into keeping the good habits I gained last year though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576436</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to use io_uring, but as long as it bypasses seccomp it should be disabled whenever seccomp is in use. As such, I use epoll, and find it annoying when kernel APIs like ublk require io_uring. The places I'd want to use ublk are inside sandboxes using seccomp. Given that container runtimes, hardened kernels, chromeos, etc., disable io_uring, using it means needing an epoll fallback anyways, so might as well just use epoll and not maintain two async backends for your application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But they were all of them deceived?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This document helped me learn the io_uring API.You can use io_uring with epoll to monitor eventfd to wake up your sleeping with io_uring wait for completions.I have implemented a barrier and thread safe techniques that I am trying to turn into a command line toolMy goal is that thread safe performant servers are easy to write.I am using bloom filters for fast set intersection. I intend to use Simd instructions with the bloom hashes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608436</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Professional coin &amp; currency nerd here)Fun fact about these — when the treasury first issued these, many people decided to cut them into odd off-center pieces and sell the resulting notes as miscut errors.Once that started happening, the treasury (BEP to be specific) very quickly changed the serial numbers so they’re all very recognizable as having come from an uncut sheet. I didn’t check the latest for all denominations, but I know for $1 bills they all start with 99.So if you see a “miscut dollar error” for sale on eBay or the like, always check the serial. If it starts with 99 then it’s just someone who had some fun with a pair of scissors and it’s not a real error.For example, to wit:https://www.ebay.com/itm/135364285098&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Wozniak (the Apple cofounder) famously bought sheets of $2 bills, and had a printer perforate and gum them into pads.So he could literally tear off $2 bills, in front of people who might not even know it was real currency, to pay them.https://web.archive.org/web/20180311084811/http://archive.wo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the US one of the few countries that can't keep a consistent design across their bills and still does not have a way for blind people to identify which note they have. They are all the same size and have no embossed markings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608155</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and realities of working in sales and telemarketing in America, highlighting the demanding nature of these jobs and the pressure on employees to meet quotas and targets. It explores the psychological and social implications of such work, including issues of burnout, job dissatisfaction, and the impact on personal lives. The piece emphasizes the need for better working conditions and support for employees in high-pressure sales environments while also critiquing the broader economic systems that perpetuate these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best sales people I've worked with were incredible strategic thinkers and not really sales people at all.They built an intimate knowledge of their customer and their industry, built strong connections with the top brass of their client by delivering exceptional work that got those people promoted, and were really good at building autonomous teams that could get the (exceptional) work done with their guidance on the customer/industry/client. These folks would also often deliver very difficult messages to their clients, which often resulted in more business not less.The sleazy sales people can build decent pipelines/sales numbers but they are not what I would ever label as 'elite'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real secret to having a successful sales career is to work at a company that sells a market leading product. This trumps 99% of anything you can do as an individual.I have seen complete noobs have good sales careers at AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The better you are at selling, the more debased your life becomes, as everything is reduced to a transaction, a leveraging of the smallest edgeI think that's the essence of having a sales mindset if I had to explain it. It's really hard to convey what it means and I think only those that worked close with people with this talent would have a chance to know what this really means. Sales is an art on top of a very technical game, where you have an unlimited number of secret knobs to balance. It's like seeing chefs or f1 drivers performing at their best, and as such it's not just about grit, you also need talent on top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602330</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the distinction between achieving Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and effectively fulfilling one’s job responsibilities. The author argues that while hitting OKRs is important for organizational success, it should not come at the expense of the core functions and values of a job. The piece emphasizes the need for balancing goal achievement with genuine work quality, encouraging teams to focus on both effective execution and fulfilling their roles meaningfully. The author also highlights the pitfalls of an overly rigid adherence to OKRs that can lead to compromising on the true intent of one's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607623"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one's team (/one's department) and market oneself (one's team) to your manager (/your company).So much mental bandwidth was spent.I also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete Input&lt;&gt;Output expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you've effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let's say you're in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is 'number of suicides averted'. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that's instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you're doing X, but you're really doing Y. Because you're disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading an anecdote about this stuff from the book The Essential Deming by W. Edwards Deming the "father of the quality movement and was hugely influential in post-WWII Japan".It talked about some company moving oil around in barges, the setup was unprofitable and a new manager was brought up to fix it. He created metrics of the business, but didn't put any goals or goalposts for the barge crews and other managers in the company.All he did was simply print the metrics and glue them on every barge of the fleet weekly. Soon the whole project was massively profitable. Apparently the captains of the barges would compete with each other to see who could save more money, without any penalties for the low performing nor any rewards for the high performing barges.One thing that was very surprising is that the barges were given freedom to choose where to source materials and, more importantly, the fuel. Before the metrics the captains would pick whatever was closest no matter the prices, after the metrics the captains would, on their own, try to source fuel from the cheapest place that they could. No amount of central planning could have been as optimal as the prices fluctuated a lot from day to day, so whenever a captain saw a good deal he would re-fuel.It turns out that empowered people want to do a good job and want to save money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reality of OKRs (or Rockefeller Habits or any other company wide framework for establishing priorities and goals,) is that by going through the exercise of trying to create them across the company, you often discover that there are meaningful disconnects in how teams are prioritizing work or how teams function vs how other stakeholders in the company believe those teams are operating. The real value comes from diving deeper into understanding those things. However, companies often view those as annoyances and find a way to plow the goals through while completely missing that learning opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607623</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the "squandered holy grail" in relation to opportunities that are often overlooked or wasted due to indecision, inaction, or underestimating their potential. It explores how individuals and organizations frequently fail to recognize and capitalize on valuable chances, leading to regret and missed growth.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it is concerning that every single Apple Intelligence feature they've shipped thus far has been not just mediocre; but bad. Being last to the party is a very normal Apple thing; quality and Doing The Right Thing takes time. Announcing something then taking months to ship it is very not-Apple, but it has happened a few times. That thing they finally ship being bad is, geeze, horribly un-Apple.One of the few examples I can think of however is Apple Maps. And it did get better; a lot better, some say better than Google Maps nowadays. So I generally do have hope for Apple Intelligence. At the end of the day, there are some disparate competing utilities in this class on the Samsung and Google phones, but no one is shipping something that is obviously game-changing and in first place; they all kinda suck, they're all tech demos, and it'll inevitably take many years to get this technology honed in to something that is truly useful to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "bicycle for the mind" goal, and the Steve Jobs quote that inspired it, is really just another restatement of McLuhan's idea of media as being extensions of man. The bicycle (or wheel, more generally) is an extension of the legs, a phone is an extension of your voice, etc.The problem with interpreting AI through that lens is that AI, as it is being used here, is not an extension of your mind. Plenty of other things are (organizers for example), but AI does not extend your thoughts. It replaces them. Its notification summary feature does not improve your ability to quickly digest lots of notification information, it replaces it with its own attempt, which, not being your own judgment, can and does easily err.There are some uses of AI that do act more like a McLuhanesque medium. Some copilot applications, in which suggestions are presented that a user accepts and refines them, are examples of this. But a lot of the uses of both image generation and LLM tools serve to limit what your mind does rather than expand it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They failed IMO as soon as they started marketing this stuff as AI. Nobody _actually_ cares about that. They just want new and exciting device capabilities. The fact that they haven’t done anything compelling enough to detach it from the AI moniker means they don’t have anything. Yet. The overall foundation is sound. Maybe in a generation or two we will have a truly compelling use case. Part of me doubts it, though, because Apple isn’t the company they used to be when it comes to innovating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607151</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this package. has a bunch of functions for most face recognition, detection and feature extraction purposes. love the readme.md docs for familiarizing with the basic features. PLUS it offers different models(backends) for the tasks which lets you try out a bunch of approach for the same task without writing a custom function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The performance is focused on correctness and the APIs work with individual images. The underlying models can be run with batches, but you need to extract the architecture code to run directly. As a result, while I started with DeepFace, I mostly just used the models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious whether others here are working with supervised dimensionality reduction for face embeddings, particularly using single-task or multi-task learning approaches.While clustering tends to perform better after dimensionality reduction, selecting the optimal dimensions depends heavily on your specific use case. This makes it more complex than simply applying PCA or t-SNE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584896</guid></item><item><title>13.

For instance, a podcast I listen to has episodes where they just talk shop and others where they play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I really cannot be bothered to care about the latter type.I actually wrote a little, easily modifiable Digital Ocean function I've been
customizing and deploying per feed I want to filter. It feels like a hack, and it is, but it's "good enough". It's been working reasonably well and runs rarely enough that it falls into Digital Ocean’s free tier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609819</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article on spline fields elaborates on a technique in computer graphics used for creating smooth curves and surfaces. It explains the principles behind spline interpolation and the various types of splines, such as Bézier and B-splines, highlighting their applications in modeling and animation. Additionally, it discusses the advantages of using spline fields in terms of flexibility and control over shape design, along with practical examples and illustrations that demonstrate how these concepts are implemented in different scenarios. Overall, the piece serves as an informative resource for understanding and applying spline fields in digital design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me when i worked on an open world game ~12 years ago. I implemented spline-based "stripes" (think long decals), mainly to be used for roads (though could also be used for smaller things like blood trails) and i added a button in the editor to align the terrain with the stripe with a configurable falloff so that it transitions smoothly from the stripe to the surrounding terrain - and optionally you could use a (grayscale) texture to modulate the falloff so that the transition isn't completely smooth.Next thing i knew, the environment artists had started using stripes to sculpt the terrain :-P&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s nice to see some real-world graphics programming in a visual language.Node-based environments can be powerful for exploring solutions like this, but they don’t often make it to Hacker News.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The surfels and isolines examples were great, reminded me of reticulating splines!

Hello! This was a false positive in our systems at
@ChainPatrol
. We are retracting the takedown request, and will conduct a full post-mortem to ensure this does not happen again.We have been combatting a huge volume of fake YouTube videos that are attempting to steal user funds. Unfortunately, in our mission to protect users from scams, false positives (very) occasionally slip through.We are actively working to reduce how often this happens, because it's never our intent to flag legitimate videos. We're very sorry about this! Will keep you posted on the takedown retraction.
"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a good baseline might be that you need to deposit say $1M and then when oops, you accidentally made a bogus claim it's OK that $1M is split between the victim of your oopsy and Youtube for their trouble - you just pay $1M to get back into the game. Outfits like this could explain to their investors that while their technology does sometimes have little goofs that cost a few billion dollars per year, once they invent perfect AI they can scale infinitely and make that back easily, so if you invest $10Bn of your fiat currency today, in 18 months they can 100% guarantee nothing in particular, wow.This works for actual creators, who are occasionally slightly inconvenienced but handsomely rewarded when that occurs, for Youtube, who get paid each time these "rare" mistakes happen, and for the companies "innovating" by making up nonsense and taking people's money. Just as well the "investment" goes to a Youtuber as to some random office park or an ad firm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just a friendly heads up. Anyone who wants to avoid Twitter, since it has become so toxic, can use the domain xcancel.com in place of twitter.com or x.com. like so:https://xcancel.com/3blue1brown/status/1876291319955398799This links to independent Nitter to provide a full thread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612494</guid></item><item><title>16.

Even though the forecast for the area had indicated a cloudy but rainless afternoon, it just started pelting down rain in buckets. There is nothing like a really cold, persistent rain to find the weak spots in your rain gear, and before long my face, chest, and feet were soaked and freezing. The rain turned what had been a mediocre day into a miserable day. It could have been worse, I guess, but only if it had rained snakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CGoaB is a fantastic resource.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case others are looking for a cheaper alternative to Formspree, I've been using https://formspark.io/ for all my websites [1] [2] [3]I paid $25 a few years ago (can't even remember when) and I still have 47k out of the 50k submission credits I bought.But I love to see a self-hostable alternative available, especially one that's as easy to use as running a `docker-compose` command. Sometimes you just need that control.For example in my case, I would get app support emails all day and night, and even if I had DND enabled, I would wake to 3-6 emails that accumulated over night and my mornings would get hectic instantly. I would forget to eat for a long time and my mood would be irritable all day.I had to place my own small API in front of Formspark to delay the emails for specific times of the day to avoid this. Something like FormBee would allow me to alter this in the server code directly instead of building yet another API.[1] https://lowtechguys.com/contact[2] https://lunar.fyi/contact[3] https://alinpanaitiu.com/contact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose the easiest way to use this or similar and be compliant with Hipaa would be to send the data vai webhook to a Hipaa compliant thing..I've been looking for self hostable:
 encryption before emailing and 
encryption at rest for form submissions dat saved in a server DB eg sql with wordpress moved to something else,anyone having suggestions (things free or under $29 / mth) I'm all ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have really easily implemented this service with Nocodb. I think the only feature missing would be the pow catpcha.I would like to have a moment in my life to write down how we have done it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42614316</guid></item><item><title>20.

Or cheap canned beans, if you're not up to cooking beans properly (I wasn't).A working-poor friend also used to buy steel-cut oats, to eat breakfast for pennies.If you buy fresh vegetables, learn how to keep them from spoiling on you.With canned soup, instant ramen, and a lot of other packaged foods, pay attention to the sodium.  (I avoid a lot of those, or end up diluting it, or, say, using only half the seasoning packet.)Where you shop matters to budget.  Where I live, WFM has bought out, or driven out, most of the other grocery stores (and one of the remaining stores prices similarly, but without the cachet), but a Market Basket is just a short hike over the train tracks.For specialty groceries, a small grocery store serving some ethnic group for which that's a staple, can be cheaper than most broader grocery stores.Don't get scurvy, or other nutritional deficiency.  If you can't make sure all your nutrients are covered, I've guessed (I'm not a nutritionist) that a mainstream multivitamin pill can't hurt.You should also count your calories, to make sure you're getting enough.  Once you start being more penny-pinching with eating, you might find yourself getting hungry less, rather than more, and it's not hard to slip into caloric deficit that will make you sick.  There are calculators on the Web for how much you should intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind this is a dangerous route to go down long term.Optimising for economic cost with the only requirement being "fill your belly" and "be palatable enough", tends to result in poor nutrition. This is roughly how the industry optimises food - minimise economic cost, maximise yield, and maximise sales (make everything artificially hyper palatable), with terrible results.In the long term this is partly covered by the economic cost on a personal basis because of the cost in health care and loss of ability to produce income due to deteriorating health. But this is displaced in time, and you do not want to do this experiment on yourself, it's not reversible.Calories are not equal, as a general rule, buying cheap food often means cheaping out on nutritional value. If you want to frame it in terms of money, buying good quality food now is an investment in your future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised at how few calories per day this wasFor day 11/2 can Campbell's Tomato Soup - 135
Milk, half of 10.7 floz - 133.75
4 slices white bread - 600
Tillamook Italian 3-Cheese, 58 g - 186.43
Butter, 32 g - 228.57
Homemade Kimchi (73 g) - 25.75135 + 133.75 + 600 + 186.43 + 228.57 + 25.75 = 1,309.5 calories which is generally well under weight maintenance levels for anyone moderately active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606773</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on the concept of a triptych, a three-part artwork often used in religious contexts. It explores its historical significance, artistic techniques, and the emotional and thematic depth achieved through the triptych format.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-author here! I'll let the proposal mostly speak for itself but one recurring question it doesn't answer is: "how likely is any of this to happen?"My answer is: I'm pretty optimistic! The people on WHATWG have been responsive and offered great feedback. These things take a long time but we're making steady progress so far, and the webpage linked here will have all the status updates. So, stay tuned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the meanwhile, I found that enabling page transitions is a progressive enhancement tweak that can go a long way in making HTML replacement unnecessary in a lot of cases.1) Add this to your css:    @view-transition { navigation: auto; }

2) Profit.Well, not so fast haha. There are a few details that you should know [1].* Firefox has not implemented this yet but it seems likey they are working on it.* All your static assets need to be properly cached to make the best use of the browser cache.Also, prefetching some links on hover, like those on a navbar, is helpful.Add a css class "prefetch" to the links you want to prefetch, then use something like this:    document.addEventListener("mouseover", ({target}) =&gt; {
      if (target.tagName !== "A" || !target.classList.contains("prefetch")) return;
      target.classList.remove("prefetch");

      const linkElement = document.createElement("link");
      linkElement.rel = "prefetch";
      linkElement.href = target.getAttribute("href");
      document.head.appendChild(linkElement);
    })

There's more work on prefetching/prerendering going on but it is a lil green (experimental) at the moment [2].--1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@view-trans...2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was reading “The future of htmx” blog post which is also being discussed on HN [1], the “htmx is the new jQuery” idea jumped out at me. Given that jQuery has been gradually replaced by native JavaScript [2], I wondered what web development could look like if htmx is gradually replaced by native HTML.Triptych could be it, and it’s particularly interesting that it’s being championed by the htmx developers.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613221[2]: https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42615646</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the regulatory developments surrounding the implementation of Wi-Fi in the 6 GHz band, highlighting the benefits of expanded bandwidth for faster and more efficient wireless communication. It emphasizes the efforts of the Wi-Fi Alliance and various regulatory bodies to enable 6 GHz Wi-Fi globally, outlining the improved performance, reduced interference, and increased capacity that this new spectrum offers. Additionally, it covers the ongoing global initiatives and successes in securing spectrum allocations for Wi-Fi use in the 6 GHz range, aiming to enhance user experiences in wireless connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like there is a “fight” with telecom guys trying to license 6GHz for 5G and others fighting for it to be unlicensed.Interesting to see that countries are tilting towards unlicensing even with strong lobbying of telecoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's always amazing to me how reluctant everyone is to grant ISM bandwidth.  If you watch a spectrum analyzer you'll immediately notice that the ISM bands are packed and licensed space is entirely empty.  At this point with devices being both much more dynamic and much more spatially multiplexed (and more directional) I have a hard time accepting arguments that really anything from DC to daylight should be licensed at this point outside of a few very small niches (GPS and airband mostly).  We should be gradually deprecating equipment that requires absolute band exclusion to operate because just slicing up spectrum is by far the least efficient way of utilizing a finite resource.It's also worth pointing out that we're about to lose about half of one of our ISM bands (915MHz, LoRa, Meshtastic, ELRS, various smart home protocols etc) due to the lovely folks at NextNav wanting dedicated bandwidth for a paywalled GPS alternative.  It's by far the best ISM band in the US for long range unlicensed communications due to being in a sweet spot of path loss, penetration, and bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606484</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "All Clocks Are 30 Seconds Late" by Victor Poughon explores the concept of time perception and its implications in daily life. It discusses how our understanding of time is influenced by various factors such as culture, technology, and personal experiences. Poughon reflects on the psychological and philosophical aspects of time, emphasizing that our clocks, while precise, often do not align with our lived experiences. The piece invites readers to reconsider their relationship with time and how it shapes their reality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All universal statements like this are wrong and stem from basic ignorance&gt; So when it's actually 14:15:45, they'll show 14:15. And when the actual time goes from 14:15:59 to 14:16:00, then that's when your clock changes from 14:15 to 14:16.No, that's a silly mistake, look at the picture (though much better - video) of the analogue clock to see it's not the case, the minutes hand moves continuously, so isn't at 15 at 15:59&gt; the meeting is in 5 minutes.That's not the only question we ask about time. Has the meeting/game already started? You can't answer that with an average value&gt; for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it's 11!No, you reply would depend on the context, which you haven't specified.&gt; Please someone tell me I'm not crazyOf course not, just trying to replace one ambiguity with another. Maybe instead come up with a more precise minutes display in digital clocks that adds more info like two dots flashing when it's past 30 sec and only 1 dot when it's before? (In phones you could use color or a few more pixels within all the padding?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flooring makes more sense in every case, from years to milliseconds and more. A few reasons:You want to send a message at exactly 13:00:00, you have a digital clock that doesn't show seconds. What you do is that you watch your clock, and as soon as it goes from 12:59 to 13:00, you press the button. That's also how you set the time precisely by hand. With rounding, that would be 12:59:30, who wants to send a message at precisely 12:59:30 ?You have a meeting at 13:00:00, you watch the clock to see if you are early or late. With flooring, if you see 13:00, you know you are late. With rounding, you are not sure.It is common for digital clocks to have big numbers for hours and minutes and small numbers for seconds. If you are not interested in seconds, you can look quickly from afar and you have your usual, floored time. If you want to be precise, you look closer and get your seconds. Rounding the minutes would be wrong, because it wouldn't match the time with seconds. And you don't want clocks with a small display for seconds you may not even see to show a different time than those that don't.And if you just want to know the approximate time and don't care about being precise to the second, then rounding up or down doesn't really matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I apologise for my "but, actually...":Analogue clocks like the face of big ben are not like digital displays, and whether they "show seconds" in the context of the meaning of this article is not, like digital displays, down to whether there is a dedicated hand.Unlike digital displays, the largest denomination hand on an analogue clock display contains all of the information that the smaller hands do (depending on the movement in some cases).The easiest way to realise this is to imagine a clock without the minute hand. Can you tell when it's half-past the hour? You can. The hour hand is half way between the two hours.Again, it depends on the movement, but it is not out of the question that your minute hand is moving once every second, and not every minute. It is down to the number of beats per unit time for an analogue display as to what the minimum display resolution is (regardless of if the movement is analogue or digital itself).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612842</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and progression of structural code editors, highlighting how these tools have evolved to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy. It explores the features and functionalities that have emerged over time, such as improved user interfaces, integration with other development tools, and support for collaborative coding. The evolution is framed in the context of changing programming practices and the increasing complexity of codebases, emphasizing the importance of structural code editors in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the way. Programs are not text, there's an impedance mismatch that shows at the seams.There're good reasons it hasn't been done more: text is good for troubleshooting, "every program should do one thing well" and maybe preventing lock-in.But with programming tools reaching maturity, we'll see more of this. Also there's an AI-related aspect: bots can understand structure just fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m obsessed with structural editors because it feels intuitively like the right approach to creating software. However I’ve yet to come across an interface that really clicks. Still love it though. Right now I’m building a structured editor for creating UIs, so can attest to how difficult it is to get it right.It’s a super interesting problem space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoy Lisp and Lisp-alike languages specifically because with the right editor support you can do a lot of this kind of structural editing stuff without giving up the niceties of source code as text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608923</guid></item><item><title>26. 42 - Spacecraft Simulation</title><link>https://github.com/ericstoneking/42</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The website "Killed by LLM" discusses the challenges and failures associated with large language models (LLMs), particularly their limitations in understanding context and providing accurate responses. It presents various examples where LLMs generated incorrect or nonsensical output, highlighting the potential consequences of relying heavily on these technologies in critical applications. The site serves as a critique of the overestimation of LLM capabilities, urging caution and critical thinking when integrating them into real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO a critical feature of the Turing test/imitation game, which many modern implementations including this site's linked paper ignore, is that the interrogator talks to both a human and a bot and must decide that one xor the other is a human. So fooling an interrogator means having them choose the bot as human over an actual human, not just judging the bot to be human (while probably judging humans to be human even more frequently).When the interrogator is only answering "do you think your conversation partner was a human?" individually, bots can score fairly highly simply by giving little information in either direction - like pretending to be a non-english-speaking child, or sending very few messages.Whereas when pitted against a human, the bot is forced to give stronger or equally strong evidence of being human as the average human (over enough tests). To be chosen as human, giving 0 evidence becomes a bad strategy when the opponent (the real human) is likely giving some positive non-zero evidence towards their personhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posted by Chollet himself:&gt; I don't think people really appreciate how simple ARC-AGI-1 was, and what solving it really means.
It was designed as the simplest, most basic assessment of fluid intelligence possible.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Simple Defer," a lightweight tool designed to simplify the asynchronous loading of JavaScript in web development. It allows developers to easily defer the execution of script tags, improving page load performance and enhancing user experience. The tool is ready-to-use and provides clear instructions for implementation, making it accessible for those looking to optimize their web pages without extensive coding knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once worked on a student robotics project where if you didn't gracefully shut down the connection to a specialized camera, it had a significant chance of physically bricking the camera.We were using C++ and essentially instrumented code review processes, despite being a student group, to ensure nothing was ever called in a way where the destructor wouldn't be called - and broke out vision processing into a separate process so if other processes crashed we'd still be okay. In retrospect it was amazing training for a software engineering career.But I always look at the words "simple" and "defer" and shudder when I see them next to each other!Just like you'd have a "threat model" for cybersecurity, make sure you understand the consequences of a defer/destructor implementation not functioning properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The C++ lambda version can be a foot gun: https://godbolt.org/z/Wd66GcrdG, if the return value is a struct, NRVO (named return value optimization) may be applied and the lambda will be called in different order.As for the n3434 proposal, given that the listed implementation experiences are all macro-based, wouldn't it be more easily adopted if proposed as a standard macro like &lt;stdarg.h&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think "you can implement this slightly modified version of the proposal in GCC macros" is a good reason to change the defer proposal. It doesn't work in clang¹ or any other non-GCC C implementation, a trailing semicolon after the close brace is an ugly wart, and saying "if you want to implement this all you have to do is implement [[gnu::cleanup]] and nested local functions" is presumably much more work for other C implementations than just implementing defer is. I also question whether this even works in GCC with executable stacks disabled (I know GCC can optimize away the trampoline since the function doesn't escape the local scope, but does GCC let you write nested functions at all without executable stacks?).¹The author says it works in clang using Apple's Blocks feature, but Blocks should not be required for defer and the variable semantics are wrong so it's a non-starter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613671</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This happens to me, a lot. I now consider it part of my workflow.I submit something for testing.It gets ignored by everyone else.I keep testing like mad, fixing even the smallest "niggles" that I can find, re-releasing, and, each time, asking for input.Which I seldom get.In the end, I say "Fuck it. Let's ship." but I don't do that, until I'm really sure that there's no more bugs to be found (spoiler: There's always more bugs to be found, and they pop up, immediately after I release).I'm constantly testing my work. It never stops, and the frequency of my testing, has virtually nothing to do with whether or not anyone else tests, or even gives me any feedback.I use Apple's TestFlight for my team testing. It registers -roughly- how many times the app under test is run by individual team members.My own testing is always an order of magnitude greater than the next person, and that is just a fraction of how many times I run it in the simulator, before releasing the test build.I'm not especially upset about that, but I don't spare a lot of sympathy for folks that complain about something after shipping, that they had every chance to catch, beforehand.But, if they are right, I'll still fix it. I just won't feel very sorry for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the largest cause of wasted programming time is building things based on what sounds plausibly useful rather than what is actually useful. It's not an easy question to answer, but it needs to be asked constantly to avoid the trap.Many of us have had the experience of spending an entire weekend feverishly hacking on something that was going to change the world, only to have someone point out a critical flaw in our assumptions as soon as they try it.This is why scratching your own itch is so effective. If you make something that you actually use every day, you might be on to something. Going from 0 to 1 users is the hardest step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something I call latent product development. Many times, the best solution is not the first one you think of - even though it may be one of many correct solutions.I have found that the best products and product features have come from latent thinking. Subconsciously pondering the problem and letting the solution arise. An example of this is a solution which comes to you in the shower - I don't know why the shower is such a hotbed for latent ideas to emerge - someone should study that!What I found most displeasing at large companies is that there's no room for latent product development. Everything is rushed. Even brand new product ideas, once the machine gets a hold of it, gets put on the conveyor belt for new ideas at a predictable and imposed rate.One such example is my last startup. We had wanted to make it easy for users not on our platform to collaborate. It was a product feature we talked about for a year but nothing ever felt right. Until one morning at 2am while I was sleeping on a recliner at my sister's house in Mali - it came to me. It also turns out that this feature was the first feature we would relaunch after being acquired by Western Digital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602273</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The document is an article by Russell L. Ackoff that explores the concept of "mess management" in organizational settings. Ackoff argues that traditional problem-solving methods often fail to address complex issues that exist as "messes," which are interrelated problems without clear boundaries. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of various factors and advocates for a holistic, systems-thinking approach to management. The article outlines strategies for effectively managing messes, including fostering collaboration, encouraging creativity, and focusing on long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Overall, Ackoff highlights the necessity for managers to reframe their thinking to navigate complexity successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a detailed exploration of the Einstein summation convention, an efficient notation used in mathematics and physics to simplify expressions involving summation over indices. It features an interactive tool that allows users to input tensor algebra formulas and visualize the corresponding Einstein summation representation, enhancing understanding of tensor operations. The site also includes explanations, examples, and intuitive guides to help users grasp the concepts behind the notation and its applications in various scientific and mathematical fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found that thinking of tensors in terms of graphs make Einsums much more natural.For example, a matrix product MN, `a b, b c -&gt; a c` is just two nodes with two edges each: `-a- M -b- N -c-`. Their `b` edges are connected, so the resulting graph has only two "free" edges `a` and `c`. That's how we know the result is another matrix.Once you look at tensors this way, a number of things that are normally tricky with standard matrix notation become trivial. Such a higher order derivatives used in neural networks.I wrote https://tensorcookbook.com/ to give a simple reference for all of this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was pretty confused by this for a while. I think the context I was missing is that this is about a function in nympy called ‘einsum’ which is somewhat related to Einstein summation notation.To write a little more: there are two things people mean by ‘tensor’. One is a kind of geometric object that corresponds to a multilinear map between vector spaces (or modules, I suppose), and another is a array indexed by k-tuples (ie what would be called a multidimensional array in C or Fortran programming). For a given choice basis, one can represent a degree k tensor with a k-dimensional array of scalars.Only certain operations make sense geometrically on tensors (in the sense that they do not depend on the choice of basis) and these can be broken down into:- tensor products, which take degree n and m tensors and output a degree (n + m) tensor- contractions which take a degree n tensor and output a degree (n-2) tensor- generalized transpositions which take a degree n tensor and output a degree n tensorA matrix multiplication can be seen as a composition of a tensor product and a contraction; a matrix trace is just a contraction.The Einstein summation convention is a notation which succinctly expresses these geometric operations by describing what one does with the ‘grid of numbers’ representation, combined with the convention that, if an index is repeated in a term twice (an odd number bigger than 1 is meaningless, an even number is equivalent to reapplying the ‘twice’ rule many times) one should implicitly sum the expression for each basis vector for that index. You get: tensor products by juxtaposition, contractions by repeated indexes, and transpositions by reordering indexes.In numpy, it is for general computation rather than expressing something geometric so one doesn’t need the restrictions on number of times an index occurs. Instead I guess the rule is something like:- if index is only on lhs, sum over it- if index on lhs and rhs then don’t sum- if index only on rhs or repeated on rhs, errorAnd computationally I guess it’s something like (1) figure out output shape and (2):  for output_index of output:
    p = 1
    for (input, input_indexes) of (inputs, lhs):
      p = p * input[input_indexes(output_index)]
    output[output_index] = p&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish Python had tools to support combining tensors a la einsum but with arbitrary operations instead of just  multiplication and addition. The only tool I'm aware of that provides a very slickk interface for this is Tullio in Julia.Among other things, that would make a lot of codde very convenient -- including graph algorithms. This is the idea behind GraphBLAS https://graphblas.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42587056</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the merits of using printf debugging as a valid and effective method for identifying and fixing bugs in programming. It argues that despite the rise of sophisticated debugging tools, printf debugging remains valuable due to its simplicity and directness. The author highlights that it can be particularly useful for quick testing and for beginners who may find complex debugging tools overwhelming. The post also emphasizes that while printf debugging may not always be the most efficient for larger projects, it allows developers to understand their code better and can be successfully integrated into more complex debugging practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a reproducible test case that runs reasonably quickly, then I think printf debugging is usually just as good as a "real" debugger, and a lot easier. I typically have my test output log open in one editor frame. I make a change to the code in another frame, save it, my build system immediately re-runs the test, and the test log immediately refreshes. So when the test isn't working, I just keep adding printfs to get more info out of the log until I figure it out.This sounds so dumb but it works out to be equivalent to some very powerful debugger features. You don't need a magical debugger that lets you modify code on-the-fly while continuing the same debug session... just change the code and re-run the test. You don't need a magical record-replay debugger that lets you go "back in time"... just add a printf earlier in the control flow and re-run the test. You don't need a magical debugger that can break when a property is modified... just temporarily modify the property to have a setter function and printf in the setter.Most importantly, though, this sort of debugging is performed using the same language and user interface I use all day to write code in the first place, so I don't have to spend time trying to remember how to do stuff in a debugger... it's just code.BUT... this is all contingent on having fast-running automated tests that can reproduce your bugs. But you should have that anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the hardest bugs I've investigated required the extreme version of debugging with printf: sprinkling the code with dump statements to produce about 500GiB of compressed binary trace, and writing a dedicated program to sift through it.The main symptom was a non-deterministic crash in the middle of a 15-minute multi-threaded execution that should have been 100% deterministic. The debugger revealed that the contents of an array had been modified incorrectly, but stepping through the code prevented the crash, and it was not always the same array or the same position within that array. I suspected that the array writes were somehow dependent on a race, but placing a data breakpoint prevented the crash. So, I started dumping trace information. It was a rather silly game of adding more traces, running the 15-minute process 10 times to see if the overhead of producing the traces made the race disappear, and trying again.The root cause was a "read, decompress and return a copy of data X from disk" method which was called with the 2023 assumption that a fresh copy would be returned every time, but was written with the 2018 optimization that if two threads asked for the same data "at the same time", the same copy could be returned to both to save on decompression time...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten an OS to run on a new platform with a debugging tool portfolio consisting of a handful of LEDs and a pushbutton. After getting to the point where I could printf() to the console felt like more than anyone could ever ask for.Anecdote aside, it certainly doesn't hurt to be able to debug things without a debugger if it comes to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607087</guid></item><item><title>34. 2DGD_F0TH A compendium of the community knowledge on game design and development</title><link>https://github.com/2DGD-F0TH/2DGD_F0TH</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Jool, a user-space implementation of NAT64, which enables IPv6 clients to communicate with IPv4 servers by translating between the two protocols. It outlines the importance of NAT64 in transitioning networks from IPv4 to IPv6, especially as IPv4 address depletion continues. The content covers installation, configuration, and operational details for Jool, emphasizing its efficiency and compatibility with various systems. Additionally, it provides examples and instructions for setting up NAT64 environments, showcasing the tool's features and benefits for network administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK IPv6 Council has a bunch of videos on running IPv6-mostly/only networks:* https://www.youtube.com/@ukipv6council468/videosThis includes at academic institutions where it's basically all BYOD so they have to deal with a more 'random' assortment of systems:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-liebzcOMAnd enterprise networks, like Jen Linkova at Google:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb98hAb5_W8Jen also had a presentation recently (2024-11) at RIPE87, "Mission Possible: How Google Plans to Turn Off IPv4!", where they've managed to reclaim 300K IPv4 addresses:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRsi6mbAWMShe's currently co-chair of the IETF IPv6 Maintenance (6man) working group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAT64 covers most of the cases. However, in my homelab experiements I very quickly found out that IPv4 literal addresses are a bit problematic for me.There are ways to fix that with 464XLAT/CLAT, but I never got around to deploying it.These days I'm just running dual-stack, with no NAT64. I hate NAT with a burning passion, so adding another layer of stateful NAT is a bit of a net negative in my eyes.Someday I'll go full IPv6 on my home network with 464XLAT. And then I'll realize that some stupid IoT device or something is not CLAT aware. Obviously there are solutions around that too, but they require an intermediate device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Jool! It worked great, but with some caveats.My ISP does DS-lite which is some abomination where the shared (split by port) IPv4 address is calculated based on the IPv6 address? Using a fixed mapping table? Which is both very popular here and has zero linux support.They had another option to do PPPoE IPv4 + SLAAC IPv6, but for this option they didn't support DHCP prefix delegation.  So I had to use this, and to work around that I needed to make my IPv6 network bridged.The problem is Jool hooks into the linux routing table, and in the bridged network none of the outbound packets reach that table.  So I had to 1. rewrite their RAs with my own DNS64 server and 2. mangle NAT64 packets to look as if they're sent to the router directly so they hit the routing table (and get processed by Jool): https://github.com/andrewbaxter/portalino/blob/main/source/o...Then I hit random MTU issues. MTU should be auto configured (and fixed when there's issues) but I saw problems with Chrome/Firefox refusing to load pages until I tried again at least 30s later until I forced the MTU lower.So close, but still so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607934</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolving role and public perception of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), highlighting how its diverse research objectives and innovations have adapted over time in response to national security needs and technological advancements. It emphasizes the agency's focus on fostering transformative technologies, the shift in its image from a secretive government body to a more transparent and collaborative organization, and the implications of its work on both military and civilian sectors. The piece reflects on how DARPA's changing faces represent broader trends in science, technology, and defense in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585409"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was only involved in government contracting for a bit in the twenty-ought tens, but the whole bit about silly requirements and by picking the lowest bidder you were selecting the contributor that "often is the one who understands the technology least" gives me flashbacks to my time in government contracting.I wasn't around for the whole JTRS fiasco, but from what I heard this effect played out there as well. Ridiculous requirements such as requiring only software updates to support new waveforms and restrictions on SWaP as well as unrealistic network sizes resulted in radios so expensive they couldn't be widely deployed. I know some people like to point to SRW as a success coming out of that, but it never has been successfully deployed to within an order of magnitude of the number of radios in the requirements and resulted in a third, incompatible, radio system used by infantry. Meanwhile, a company that was excluded from the program built the radio that the military actually needed, which could communicate to both of their existing systems.I was around for it's successor where they swapped software for FPGAs and made the same "software only" update requirement. The primary winner of the contract had no experience in digital logic and decided to implement the thing in MatLab (which provided no real mechanism for multiple clock domains or other features needed for high performance large scale digital design). Other contractors had to fit their design into this mess of a system. When it didn't fit in any FPGA, they opted to put it in an ASIC. And another of the contractors managed to convince the PM that their newest dev board was perfect for integrating this -- allowing them to pay for the internal R&amp;D for that board on the project's expense (after all PCIE and SRIO are practically the same, right?).I left at that point because failure was the only option and I could make more money writing code to meet silly requirements in the tech sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article is very interesting and focuses on the historic faces of DARPA, not really getting too much into the modern state of the agency. Over the past 10+ years DARPA have embraced the OTA - other transaction authority - as a contract vehicle to allow DARPA PMs additional flexibility and speed in letting contracts. This has allowed, perhaps, a return to more of the ideas of the old days in which a performer and PM might seek that "meeting of the minds" mentioned in the article, and issue funding to start work.A real limitation perhaps that DARPA has is the 3-5 year PM timeline. PMs start with a project and vision for their work, often a multiphase effort. We often joke that the challenges DARPA offers are not all that difficult, only the schedule is. A few years ago I worked on what would have been a wonderful project on a 2 year timeline which was compressed to half that, with the usual shifting sands of requirements consuming the majority of the allocated time.I can't say that giving PMs a longer timeframe would be a good thing - that 3-5 year PM clock keeps everything moving apace. Perhaps the longer-term programs ought to be given by the office directors to PMs, but then you have the disadvantage (mentioned in the article) of PMs having to execute a project they don't believe in. That hasn't worked well; disengaged PMs, focused on their passion projects, don't give the needed attention to inherited assignments.The future of the agency is concerning. Given increasing time and funding limitations, coupled with the Heilmeier focus, there's been a tremendous push towards immediate results. Which means simpler targets that don't provide the amazing leaps ahead that DARPA was once known for. Look to their current SBIR topics, which include one on the use of language models for suicide prevention, and another on processing data to generate facility clearances. These are not leaps ahead, but instead incremental, focused improvements. We once lost a DARPA proposal because our plan was too certain to work, they wanted more risk. Quite a change.DARPA still hires visionary PMs, and they have the tools again to realize these visions. I hope to see a return to the DARPA referenced in the early article. It will be fun to pitch ideas to those guys. I'm tired of talking to the ones who are too focused on today to think about tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585409</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO until the abstract logging interface is built into the language, or standard library, we'll keep building different log libraries and adapters between them, and shipping libraries without logging.It makes me actively disinterested in these libraries. I just want some built in interface with levels, hierarchy, and structured logging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never really caught on with the idea of integrating external I/O in something as fundamental as logging. More often that not a pull vs push approach is suited for logging. There are dozens of high performant log collectors/aggregators who can collect, transform, and push logs to N number of stores. What’s the advantage of doing this right inside the app? (Besides maybe serverless functions?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s frustrating that this is necessary but it definitely makes sense, and I will probably add it to several projects soon.Thanks for your hard work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606454</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very interesting. I played around with (dependently) typed combinatory logic a while ago, using a system called "illative combinatory logic" http://www.chriswarbo.net/blog/2012-12-01-typed_combinators.... and I agree that's it's hard to actually use ;)I was approaching typed combinator expressions as a target for AI systems (this predated transformers; I was thinking more like genetic programming, inductive programming, etc.), but in order to trust the results it would need to be free from paradoxes (like Type : Type).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependent Types + Combinatory Logic is highly non-trivial, as is shown in this series of work by Altenkirch et al.:https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.F...https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol269-typ...https://types2023.webs.upv.es/slides/S22/TYPES2023-Altenkirc...I wonder: Where does rholang3 fit in this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if combinators could be useful for neurosymbolic AI—either in the backward pass (e.g., training models on synthetic data) or the forward pass (e.g., iterative code generation with evolutionary algorithms). Combinators feel alien, making even Haskell or APL seem intuitive, but maybe that’s because they don’t align with human working memory. Language models, with their massive context windows, handle long-range dependencies in sequences well, even if their understanding is shallower in some ways. Could combinators, with their compositional and deductive nature, be a better fit for machines than humans? For example, instead of generating Python functions in an evolutionary approach[0], could we use combinators as the building blocks? They’re compact, formal, and inherently step-by-step, which might make them ideal for tasks requiring structured reasoning and generalization.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their “value added” list seems mostly good. But I’m confused about/sceptical of:&gt; Reduced Power Consumption: The smaller size of individual chiplets contributes to lower power consumption. Each chiplet can be optimized for energy efficiency, and the overall system can be designed to minimize power waste. This feature is particularly crucial as the demand for energy-efficient technology grows in sectors like mobile computing and data centers.Each chiplet can be designed to minimize power consumption? Of course, sure, anything can be designed to minimize power consumption. The overall system can be designed to minimize power waste? Sure, I guess. But do the chiplets actually help there? If they are saying chiplets help there—I don’t see it. If they are saying they can work around it and it doesn’t hurt as much as you’d expect, I believe them.Overall I’d expect chiplets to have slightly higher power consumption than a similar monolithic chip. The network isn’t free. There’s some loss of flexibility as the design has to be broken up over multiple chips.But I’d also expect the higher yields should let them use newer process nodes, so in the end… the choice of a similar monolithic chip is probably not available!Also I guess they could do better power gating than a monolithic design probably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one of their founders passed on, so much knowledge is now lost :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585438</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This book is middling at best. From a literary perspective it's terrible. It reads like GPT-3.5 wrote it. Now from an introduction to a new idea perspective and understanding how AI will affect society, its __fine__. The book is full of contradictions. Suleyman regularly points out how we've __never__ successfully constrained a disrupting technological innovation and then says we NEED to here. I mean, absolutely absurd stuff. Ostensibly ends on an optimistic note, but is actually much more nihilistic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author is the head of Microsoft AI. Gates might not be entirely unbiased here :)edit: as a semi-related question for folks here. How often do you 'vet' authors of non-fiction books prior to reading the book?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The historian Yuval Noah Harari has argued that humans should figure out how to work together and establish trust before developing advanced AI. In theory, I agree. If I had a magic button that could slow this whole thing down for 30 or 40 years while humanity figures out trust and common goals, I might press it. But that button doesn’t exist. These technologies will be created regardless of what any individual or company does.Is that true, though? Training runs for frontier models don’t happen without enormous resources and support. You don’t run one in your garage. It doesn’t happen unless people make it happen.Is this really a harder coordination problem than, say, stopping climate change, which Gates does believe is worth trying?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602850</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one thing few are willing to admit is that a large blame for this can be placed on disinterested parents. Parents that believe it is solely the school/teacher's job to educate their child.When kids are at home, parents should be involved in the learning process. You don't have to be a helicopter and monitor everything, but you should take interest in the work your child is doing. If you check in at least once while they're doing homework it will be very easy to catch issues like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm close to someone who teaches at a university, and they're making heavy use of in-room essays written in blue books. This ensures that the work is purely the students, but I think it also has the side-effect that the grader is also working manually.I kinda think maybe at earlier levels, most homework should be moved into the classroom and done on paper anyway? What's the point of homework if they're not going to do it themselves and they're not going to learn? So just push that back into the classroom and don't try to take up their time out of school needlessly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also have young relatives who are using this technology (a bit older though, teenagers). One problematic thing I see is not knowing just how inaccurate these answers are. Somehow many people just assume complete correctness and accuracy because that's how they think of or have been primed to think of technology. Of course, the marketing and hype when it comes to AI doesn't help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611844</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concepts of magic links and passkeys as modern alternatives to traditional password systems for authentication. It explains how magic links work by allowing users to log in via a link sent to their email, thereby eliminating the need for remembering passwords. Passkeys, on the other hand, leverage public key cryptography to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication method across devices. The piece emphasizes the benefits of these technologies, such as improved security, reduced risk of phishing attacks, and enhanced user experience, while also addressing potential challenges in their implementation and user adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magic links have rough edges, Passkeys have black holes.&gt; On this blog I speak only for myself as someone experienced in usable security and website authentication.This caveat near the top speaks to my point, if you're a developer and you understand what an SSH key is, you'll take to Passkeys no problem. But if you aren't, there are many foot guns abound and vendor lock-in you won't notice until it bites you.I work for an auth company, I use a Yubikey and Passkeys all the time, in a business context where there is an IT admin to go to when there is a problem, I think Passkeys will do great. They'll really improve the average security posture of an organization.But I would dread having to try and recover a Passkey with Google, who would I even talk to? I just had to explain what a VPN was to my parents, I would not be excited to try and explain to them how Passkeys work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are going to be a complete failure, because a) vendor lock-in. I can easily move a password around; it's just a string. As far as I understand it, major passkey implementations are basically non-portable.And b) I don't understand them. If I don't understand them what chance does the average non-nerd have? I probably could understand them, if I bothered to look into the details of how they work, but I really don't want to have to do that and normal people won't either. Nobody needs to do research to understand passwords or email login links (at least at a basic level).I predict they will be abandoned in 10 years.I wonder if a better solution is just to accept email-is-authority and make the magic link flow more seamless. Imagine if you could link your email client and your web browser closely together so that every site that offered a magic link "just worked". You click a button, it emails you, your email client silently notifies the web browser and deletes the email, and then you get logged in.Google could easily do that automatically with Gmail and Chrome. The only downside I can see is that email is still a bit slower than password authentication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think magic links and passkeys are awful for websites. I have refused to give services money because their only login system is a magic link, passkey or using a 3rd party login. For example, I got some free credits for clipdrop.co, I like their service, even setup the API and got everything working, but when it was time to buy some real credits and give them money, their login system was so awful I just found an alternative with a path of least resistance.Another company I wanted to give lots of money too was fal.ai, but you can only login through github, which I didn't want to do. I even emailed them asking about alternatives but they couldn't even bother to reply. So my money was spent else where.I don't have my email login on my computer so for every tragic link I get that means I would either have to find a way to get the link from my phone to the computer or login to my email from the computer just to click that stupid link.You know what faster, more efficient and better in every way? Using an user and password.I should not have to suffer because some nitwits can't remember their passwords, we should not subsidize mediocrity because we will get more mediocrity.Thank you for reading my rant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607455</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on how to use Common Lisp to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on music sheets found in YouTube videos. It outlines the process, starting from extracting frames from a video to analyzing those frames for musical scores. The tutorial details the necessary tools, libraries, and coding techniques required to successfully implement OCR for music, helping users to convert and transcribe music notation directly from video content into a digital format.&lt;/p&gt;

  l2  = length(gzip(i2))
  l12 = length(gzip(concatenate(i1, i2))

  ncd = (l12 - min(l1, l2))/max(l1, l2)

&lt;p&gt;The article on the "Raising of Chicago" details the ambitious engineering project in the late 19th century responsible for elevating many buildings in Chicago to combat frequent flooding and improve sanitation. Initiated in response to the city's challenges with stormwater and sewage management, the process involved lifting structures using jacks and adjusting their foundations as well as altering the street levels. This monumental endeavor transformed Chicago's landscape, allowing for better drainage systems and contributing to the city’s growth and modernization. The project is noted for its ingenuity and the impact it had on urban planning and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if this was during the same time period or not, but in some parts of the city (mostly residential or smaller commercial areas) they didn't bother raising the buildings, they just built the streets up higher and added flying walkways from the new sidewalk height to the new front entrances on the second story of the houses. Many of them had stairs that went down to the old ground level and I think in most of them they had been converted to separate apartments.My dad's small commercial building in Pilsen looked normal, but if you peeked into the holes in the sidewalk out front you could see a vaulted space underneath where the old sidewalk used to be, which was kind of unnerving when you realized the sidewalk was crumbling. You could even access it from the basement of his building (which I suppose used to be the ground level?), but he never let me go down there as a kid.I also know of one or two old homes from around this time period in the neighborhood I grew up in (which wasn't part of Chicago at this time) that were later moved off what became the main avenue through the area to new locations about a block away. I think that happened much later though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole concept is bonkers! By this i mean that i can not imagine many officials would even have the will to even try something so big and audacious nowadays. Also, my favorite note in the wikipedia entry (besides the whole article being awesome!), is this one: "Many of the city's old wooden buildings were considered not worth raising, so instead the owners of these wooden buildings had them either demolished or else placed on rollers and moved to the outskirts of Chicago. Business activities in such buildings continued, as they were being moved." Just crazy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently Sna Francisco also has the tradition of moving houses, most recently in 2021 https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/22/victorian-ho...The Guardian also has an article written back then: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/23/san-francisc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611978</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept that software is increasingly dominating various industries and aspects of life, highlighting how this trend has accelerated due to technological advancements and globalization. It emphasizes that software is not just a tool for efficiency but a transformative force reshaping business models and consumer behavior. The author examines the implications of this shift, including the potential for innovation, the challenges it poses for traditional businesses, and the need for adaptability in a rapidly changing digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I resonate with Dubray's sentiments. Maybe it's because I just turned 50 and am more contemplative at the half-century mark, but I feel anymore like I'm playing a part in peddling schlock and snake oil. Our industry is increasingly selling products that are extractive and zero-sum as opposed to being the tide that lifts all boats. Was I always living a lie in a way, or have things truly become qualitatively worse over the past 10 or 15 years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to sound like an elitist ahole but this all worked so much better when it was a small, self selecting group of users.But the most disenfranchising part of all this is how quickly/how willing tech people were to allow/promote/encourage awfulness and destructiveness for $$$. I had such a different view of that scene in the 90s/early 2000s. But the good news is we are self reflecting and not happy with the current status quo. Hopefully we don't settle for the 'hide in our gated community' discord model but come up with something better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think software engineering is inherently a management job. When you write code, you write company policy, but that policy isn't followed by human employees, it's followed by electronic employees - computers.These electronic employees are very good at following very simple instructions. They enable the business to handle enormous numbers of customers concurrently, but those customers can only be handled in the way that the software engineers planned for.The author complains about businesses that operate two-sided markets, which is an economic function traditionally handled by governments. Governments imposed lots of regulations, but Uber, DoorDash and their ilk decided to do away with all that. This resulted in litanies of scandals, and the businesses rapidly putting these poorly-implemented policies in place. It turns out that all those regulations, accumulated over centuries, were actually necessary to ensure that the markets functioned properly. The wunderkind founders made their billions by burning Chesterton's fences.Generation Z, I understand, is increasingly abandoning dating apps, because the apps aren't optimised for connecting their users with compatible partners. If all the cool kids are finding their relationships offline, then eventually it'll just be the uncool looking for love on the internet (just like in the dial-up days).In a similar way, if it's too much of a pain in the arse to deal with a delivery app, then some restaurants will stop dealing with them, and rely on word of mouth. If every other restaurant is on the delivery apps, then the restaurant that isn't on the apps suddenly becomes the 'hidden gem', the place you hear about from that colleague who likes to drop names to show everyone that they're cool.(On the other hand, if you're running the slightly-below-average pizza place that people call when they can't be bothered to cook, then you should probably be on the apps. This is a matter of market positioning.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613550</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for TiDB, an open-source distributed SQL database developed by PingCAP, provides resources for understanding, using, and contributing to the platform. TiDB is designed to handle large-scale transactions and offers features such as horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and support for hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP). The repository includes documentation, installation guides, API references, and information on how to contribute to the project, along with release notes and issue tracking to facilitate community engagement and development.&lt;/p&gt;

2 is written in Rust and uses RocksDB
4 is written in C++2 &amp; 3 are graduated CNCF projects maintained by PingCAP.Disclaimer: I work for PingCAP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VC backed database company with a CLA on their "open source" project. Red flag.
Is there a community fork yet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these new distributed DBs. CockroachDB is one of them. Still I think a managed Postgres/MySQL is a better choice. My primary concern is how challenging will it be if you have to eventually move your data out to a RDBMS for cost or other reasons. Does anyone have any experience ? I am not talking enterprise scale but data about size of 50 - 100GB scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585025</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an incredibly vague essay. Let me be more explicit: I think this is a clear sign of a bubble. LLMs are very cool technology, but they are not the second coming. It can't do experiments; it doesn't have an imagination; it doesn't have an ethical framework; its not an agent in any human sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my mind, LLMs are lowering the barrier of searching in the same way Google did in the early 2000s. Back then, you had to very specifically tailor your search key words, not use words such as "the," "a," etc. Google eventually managed to turn queries such as "what's the population of Ghana" into ready-made answers.LLMs do exactly that for more complex queries, with the downside of possible hallucinations. Suddenly, instead of doing a research on the topic, a person looking to become "a programmer" asks ChatGPT to create a syllabus for their situation, and possibly even actually generate the contents of the syllabus. ChatGPT then "searches the internet" and creates the response.I have gained confidence that LLMs won't be much more (at least in the next couple years) than search engines with the upside of responding to complex queries, and downside of hallucinations. And for that, I find LLMs quite useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As AI has continued to improve quickly, it’s been interesting to watch the sentiment of the tech community get more negative on it. “It’s not very good yet.” “No improvement since GPT-4.”Objectively, today’s AI is incredibly impressive and valuable. We blew past the Turing test and yet no one seems to marvel at that.I’d argue and we still have yet to discover the most effective ways to incorporate the existing models into products. We could stop progress now and have compelling product launches for the next few years that change industries. I’m confident customer support will be automated shortly - a previously large industry for human employment.Is the negative sentiment fear from tech folks because they have a lot to lose? Am I just not understanding something? It feels like I can watch the progress unfold, but yet the community here continues to say nothing is happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606700</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of different approaches to governance by comparing fascism and liberal democracy. It argues that while both systems enforce societal norms, fascism employs a more rigid and oppressive structure contrasted with the more flexible and adaptive nature of liberal democracy. The author examines the historical context of these ideologies, highlighting the appeal of fascism in times of crisis and the importance of critical thinking and vigilance in protecting democratic values against authoritarian tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think maybe the article goes too far, perhaps begging the question.  It is one thing to say that people have unreconcilable beliefs, ones that cause insult or injury as a result of that conflict.  It is harder to put them in categories and say that "fascism" is forcing a belief on other people out of a desire to reduce harm and "rakishness" is acting consistent with another set of beliefs that does not find harm in that behavior.  I don't know of a philosophically acceptable definition of rakishness, but Fascism has several definitions by both proponents and detractors.  Proponents would say that it has an element of blotting out weak, foreign things and promoting strong, native things.  Detractors would say that it is whatever is needed to get people to fear and hate an outgroup.  Umberto Eco's definition of "ur-Fascism" proposed a framework of features that go together but not necessarily found in every Fascist belief system.  I like that definition because it doesn't require people to explicitly call their movement Fascist and it presents the beliefs/behavior as something more innate to the human experience and not a product of modernity.The dilution of the word Fascist to mean someone who would censor you for some reason, has been bad for discussions of Fascism and its ilk.  Now the word seems to include the person who asks you to show them respect by using their correct name or pronouncing it correctly, as well as the person who would execute you for writing "sick" literature that contradicts a fascist belief system, somehow equating the two.Are there rakes in the world?  Do some people think they are not rakes, while other people think they are?  Probably.  But maybe it is better to try to agree on what is really going on in real discussions, rather than hypotheticals about candies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ITT missing the forest for the trees and focusing on- The incorrect definition of "fascist". The article is just using the word as a label for "people who don't let others do things that don't hurt anyone". Yeah it should've used another label like "authoritarian" or "wall", but the ultimate message is the same.- Over-analyzing the rules: "you should let people do what they want, unless they're hurting other people" but what if "hurt" is something stupid like "going outside hurts me because you're ugly"? This is the first half of the ultimate message, the article agrees that people assign stupid meanings to "hurt" and that is the source of many disagreements.- The article suggesting you try logic and morals to persuade someone who isn't following logic and morals. The second half of the ultimate message is that sometimes you think someone isn't acting logically or morally (ex: the person trying to stop you from eating tictacs because they're on a power-trip) when they are (ex: said person is really tying to stop you because they believe tic-tacs are sentient, which if true, would justify intervention). And yes, some people are on power-trips or otherwise acting in bad faith. But most people simultaneously believe they use logic and morals, and most other people don't; because people don't act as rationally and morally as they think, and (the article's message) they mis-judge others as bad-intentioned when they're good-intentioned but have bad assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those non-native speakers confused by this usage of the word “rake” like me, it’s, apparently, the meaning under “Etymology 6” on Wiktionary: https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/rake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608758</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here.I wrote this book so you can spend a boring weekend writing an operating system from scratch. You don’t have to write it in C - you can use your favorite programming language, like Rust or Zig.I intentionally made it not UNIX-like and kept only the essential parts. Thinking about how the OS differs from Linux or Windows can also be fun. Designing an OS is like creating your own world—you can make it however you like!BTW, you might notice some paragraphs feel machine-translated because, to some extent, they are. If you have some time to spare, please send me a PR. The content is written in plain Markdown [1].Hope you enjoy :)[1] https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines/tree/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very delightful article. Based on my experience in "hobby" OS programming, I would add setting up GDB debugging as early as possible. It was a great help in my projects and an improvement over debugging with the QEMU monitor only.QEMU contains a built-in GDB server, you'll need a GDB client built for the target architecture (riscv in this case) and connecting to the QEMU GDB server over the network.https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/gdb.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any rust enthusiasts, phil-opp's guide is such a fun exercise to try out. It was actually the first thing I tried in Rust (very silly idea) and ended up only understanding ~5% of what I had just typed out.I tried it again 2-3 years later and took the time to go over each subject. I even planned in advance to make sure I was going to finish it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631873</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the security vulnerabilities associated with 512-bit DKIM RSA keys in email authentication. It highlights how these keys can be cracked using modern computing power, making them insufficient for protecting email integrity.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth look into the operations of a voice phishing crew, showcasing their tactics, techniques, and the daily grind of scamming individuals. It details how these scammers leverage social engineering, technology, and psychological manipulation to create a convincing narrative that leads victims to divulge sensitive personal information.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My parents' independent gas station in rural western Ohio (in a town of sub-1000 population, albeit on a state route that sees significant commuter traffic) was targeted for a voice phishing scam over the last week. A caller left voice messages to multiple recipients (we're not sure how many, but it seems like at least double-digits) purporting to be the gas station and asking to settle-up unpaid bills via credit card over the phone. I didn't get to hear any of the callers, unfortunately. The call-back number they left wasn't the gas station's number, nor was the caller ID the gas station's number.At first I felt like it was probably a small-time local scammer. Then I thought about how close we are to being able to run this entire scam using fully automated means (including voice assistant software and an LLM to talk to the callers, probably with a human in the loop for handing exceptions). I assume we'll see a rash of these kinds of scams targeting local businesses once the tool kits to run them become widely available.The idea of building up the automation to run that scam sounds like fun. I wouldn't actually do it but somebody with fewer moral scruples absolutely will (or, rather, probably already has).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have gotten a few of those "Apple" phishing attempts. They really look legit. My Apple ID got compromised, many years ago, and people try to use it, from time to time.However, I am pretty up on the state of my accounts, so I won't follow up on them.The only people who ever call me, from Apple, are the Developer Support folks, and that's usually to castigate me, for stepping on some soft spot, or in response to me reaching out to them. I totally ignore calls from numbers that I don't know; a rare privilege.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many non-techy folks that are getting run over by phishers. If tech workers can also be targeted, the rest really have no hope.I really wish someone would make movies or enticing thriller series out of these post-mortems. There are some good stories to be told, plus it would help the most vulnerable to be better prepared..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42629163</guid></item><item><title>5.

People who are really into staying up all night dancing to techno music aren't buying expensive alcoholic drinks, they're buying cheap water to stay hydrated. Many (though by no means all) take drugs, but generally that means one dose of a drug like MDMA at the beginning of the evening. Psychedelic drugs like LSD are also associated with the rave scene but are less compatible with a nightclub environment (bars, security, overgrown disco lights). People are more likely to consume psychedelics at an outdoor party or a warehouse space.In my view what has killed raves was the declining availability of cheap accessible commercial spaces, police/administrative hostility to informal economic activity, and overcommercialization, which has tended to select for the shittiest music/DJs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One big change is that they got better and much more organized. I go to an annual event with a few hundred of my friends and family. We rent a lodge in a national forest, set up an enormous sound system, and dance for 3 days around some very confused deer. There are food trucks and coffee bars and dozens of portapotties scattered around, plus daytime poolside sets while we swim around and listen to 100dB house.We grayvers still like to have fun, just more comfortably. We have work next week, you know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606318</guid></item><item><title>6.

It's called Diva Copilot and it can be accessed at https://divacopilot.com - I started out by offering a free trial with 10 free presets and then a monthly $20 plan with 50 presets. You can also buy on-demand credits. It works on top of a custom built RAG system that then uses GPT-4o for actually generating .h2p files.

This would have been incredibly useful to have found when I was writing my own implicit-surface drawer. My approach is similar in some ways (interval arithmetic), and different in others (not as optimized, I directly produce GLSL for a fragment shader).Honestly I'm tempted to just toss everything away and replace it with (a reimplementation of) this.

I found it difficult to click on a tiny pixel on screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very nice. I didn't know Pluto's orbit was more inclined than many of the others.It also gives me strong "The Expanse" vibes. Probably because there are so many orbital bodies shown that were mentioned in those books.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent!I think the utility of generating vectors is far, far greater than all the raster generation that's been a big focus thus far (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc). Those efforts have been incredibly impressive, of course, but raster outputs are so much more difficult to work with. You're forced to "upscale" or "inpaint" the rasters using subsequent generative AI calls to actually iterate towards something useful.By contrast, generated vectors are inherently scalable and easy to edit. These outputs in particular seem to be low-complexity, with each shape composed of as few points as possible. This is a boon for "human-in-the-loop" editing experiences.When it comes to generative visuals, creating simplified representations is much harder (and, IMO, more valuable) than creating highly intricate, messy representations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a huge fan of this type of incremental generative approach. Language isn’t precise enough to describe a final product, so generating intermediate steps is very powerful.I’d also like to see this in music generation. Tools like Suno are cool but I would much rather have something that generates MIDIs and instrument configurations instead.Maybe this is a good lesson for generative tools. It’s possible to generate something that’s a good starting point. But what people actually want is long tail, so including the capability of precision modification is the difference between a canned demo and a powerful tool.&gt; Code coming soonThe examples are quite nice but I have no idea how reproducible they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been impressed with even applying sonnet to SVGs for animations. This looks like it could be a lot more powerful.Fun example: https://gist.github.com/scosman/701275e737331aaab6a2acf74a52...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636873</guid></item><item><title>13.

I found it fast-moving, and it focused a lot more on applications than fundamentals, which meant it was more wide than it was deep. This didn't turn out so well when I decided to study ML later and needed stronger linear algebra fundamentals, but it was a fun course. There were a couple interesting course projects, one of which was using linear algebra to balance a (simulated) 2D robot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man this would have been nice when I was in school.For some reason linear algebra still isn't part of standard Mechanical Engineering course load (Calc 1, 2, 3, DiffEq) which made life extremely difficult in some of the later classes. I remember spending weeks brute forcing a lot of things that would have been trivial with a little bit of matrix math.I took a superficially similar class as a 400 level elective but it assumed everyone already knew linear algebra going in, and it was a disaster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633805</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Slack's implementation of automated accessibility testing to enhance the usability of their platform for all users, including those with disabilities. It outlines the importance of accessibility in software development, the tools and methodologies used for testing, and the challenges faced during the integration of automated tests. The team shares their commitment to continuous improvement in accessibility practices and highlights the significance of collaboration and feedback in creating an inclusive experience for all Slack users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little OT but are people running playwright in docker on CI? Curious if it needs to be dockerised for consistent screenshots on local vs CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am one of the maintainers of the axe accessibility testing engine the Slack team is using. It's awesome to see such a detailed writeup of how folks are building on our team's work!We publish the engine (axe-core) and the "core" playwright integration library Slack is using (@axe-core/playwright) as open source, but if you're interested in what the Slack team has described in this blog, we also have a paid offering called axe Developer Hub (https://www.deque.com/axe/developer-hub) that offers a similar workflow to what the Slack folks describe here: It hooks into end-to-end tests you already have to add in accessibility testing without needing a ton of code changes to your test suite.It's very enlightening to see which features the Slack folks prioritized for their setup and to see some of the stuff they were able to do by going deep on integration with Playwright specifically. It's not often you are lucky enough to get feedback as strong as "we cared about &lt;feature&gt; enough to invest a bunch of engineering time into it".If you're interested in building these sort of accessibility tools, my team is hiring! https://www.deque.com/careers/senior-accessibility-tool-deve...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article about accessibility - code snippets added as images. And what about alt text? It just broadly summarizes what is displayed in image.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing.Update #2:I appreciate you guys for all of your advice.This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.I'm not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to UW a decade ago, and back then it was pretty common knowledge that you don't fuck with software and the class registration system. Registering for classes was really competitive and they were really strict about making sure that no one had an edge over anyone else by being able to write code. There were plenty of rumors of people being expelled for using scripts to try to get the classes they wanted right when they opened. I also believe they forbid or at least frowned on students "trading" registrations, because they didn't want even more people trying to sign up for high value classes and trading them as a commodity.So at least back when I went there, basically any CS student could have told you that this website was a horrible idea that is sure to get you in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s just how colleges are. I once reported to my alma mater that a somewhat obscure (but obviously public) link seemed to trigger the download of a zip of student details for no discernible reason (I think it was a WIP site), and they immediately threatened to call the FBI on me. I just sort of laughed it off, but I decided that was the last time I was going to initiate any sort of contact with them if I didn’t absolutely have to.Which is the policy I followed when I found that they had stored one of their LDAP admin passwords in a world readable file on the CS servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638626</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth explanation of the concept of debouncing in digital electronics, particularly focusing on switches and buttons. It discusses the issues that arise from mechanical switch bounce, which can cause false triggering in circuits. The author explores various techniques to effectively debounce switches, including hardware solutions like RC (resistor-capacitor) filters and software algorithms. The article emphasizes the importance of choosing the right debouncing method based on the specific application requirements and offers detailed examples and considerations to help designers implement effective debouncing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But some environments are notoriously noisy. Many years ago I put a system using several Z80s and a PDP-11 in a steel mill. A motor the size of a house drawing thousands of amps drove the production line. It reversed direction every few seconds. The noise generated by that changeover coupled everywhere, and destroyed everything electronic unless carefully protected. We optocoupled all cabling simply to keep the smoke inside the ICs, where it belongs. All digital inputs still looked like hash and needed an astonishing amount of debounce and signal conditioning.:-)I had a similar experience with a elevator motor and a terminal. The electronics worked absolutely fine, but when someone operated the elevator it occasionally produced phantom keypresses on the capacitive keypad.This was perhaps understandable, but what really confused the users was that these phantom keypresses sometimes pressed the not fitted debug buttons (which weren't on the production keypad) which stuck the device into debug mode!We learnt not to include the debug code in the production firmware and beefed up the transient suppression hardware and the debouncing firmware to fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Years ago a pal and I installed a system for the Secret Service that had thousands of very expensive switches on panels in a control room. We battled with a unique set of bounce challenges because the uniformed officers were too lazy to stand up and press a button. They tossed rulers at the panels from across the room. Different impacts created quite an array of bouncing.It's impossible to guess how users will use a system until they can be observed in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One vendor told me reliability simply isn't important as users will subconsciously hit the button again and again till the channel changes.Orthogonally to the point of this excellent article, I found it striking how this was probably true, once--and then TVs got smart enough that it took seconds to change channels, instead of milliseconds. And then it was no longer possible for input failures to be corrected subconsciously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601890</guid></item><item><title>18.

Not just because some of those games are deeply ingrained in my childhood, but also because the writing itself is exceptional. The structure is strong, there’s no fluff, and it’s still vivid and playful. I loved it.I also read the author's thoughts on the writing process, and the way he described it closely mirrored how I approach working on music, which was illuminating.I also loved the article about how software development is a form of knowledge building. Once again, excellent writing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark was nice enough to invite me to his home studio when I was a new high school grad to talk working in games as an artist. He told me the story of the fight over dithering.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We lost our house to the Eaton fire this morning. It’s difficult to describe the vastness of the destruction in our community. Everything within a couple square miles of us burned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many neighborhoods and landmarks along PCH in Malibu just gone. There's nothing left. Hard to fathom or overstate what the impact of all this will be. Every year I go down to the beach at sunrise on January 1st with my dad. We pulled over somewhere, don't know where, along the way, to catch the sunrise. Today when I first woke up I opened twitter and saw a video of the charred skeletons of the houses right where we were standing just one week ago. Recognized it from the background of the picture I took of him. Fucking insane.edit: much of today has been giving me flashbacks of the Woolsey fire. the only way, probably, this fire today is better than the Woolsey fire, is that there likely won't be a mass shooting the very next day, like what happened back then, at the Borderline shooting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was in Pacific Palisades when the fire started yesterday. I've never seen one spread so fast. It went from there being smoke way in the distance and people going about their lives normally, then 90 minutes later the fire was everywhere and people were panicking and evacuating en masse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638735</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an optimization approach for the Riemann assignment problem, which involves dividing a space into regions for optimal allocation of resources. It outlines various mathematical concepts and techniques used to solve this problem, including algorithms for efficient computation and the impact of different parameters on the assignment quality. The author also presents examples and visualizations to illustrate the results, providing insights into both the theoretical and practical aspects of the optimization process. Overall, the piece offers a detailed exploration of how mathematical optimization can enhance decision-making in resource allocation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how things I never expect to see on here pop up occasionally. I had read some of the early papers by Boumal on optimization over Riemannian manifolds in 2016 for a similar problem and even wrote some Julia code for it (before manifolds.jl existed).In my case, I was trying to perform synchronization over a set of noisy point clouds to extract the "ground truth" point cloud. I.e., take the set of coordinates corresponding to a point cloud, randomly permute the order of the coordinates, randomly rotate/reflect the point cloud, and then apply a Gaussian perturbation to each coordinate. Repeat this process multiple times. The goal then is to recover the original point cloud from the noisy rotated/reflected/permuted copies of the original.Boumal and Singer had done some work to solve this problem for just rotations/reflections by essentially "stacking" the unknown orthogonal matrices (i.e., elements of O(3)) into a Stiefel manifold and then performing Riemannian optimization over this manifold. It worked fantastically well and was much faster than prior techniques involving semidefinite programming, so I decided to try the same approach for synchronization over permuted copies of the point cloud, and it also worked quite well. However, one can achieve better convergence properties by performing a discrete Fourier transform over the symmetric group on the sets of point clouds so that instead of optimizing over a Stiefel manifold that is supposed to represent stacked permutation matrices (well, stacked orthogonal matrices with constraints to make them doubly stochastic), you optimize over a manifold of stacked unitary matrices intended to represent irreps of S_n.Ultimately I didn't know enough group theory at the time to figure out how to generate irreps for the "combined" group of O(3) and S_n, so I couldn't solve the problem simultaneously for both rotations/reflections and permutations, but ultimately Singer and Boumal developed an approach that bypassed the synchronization problem altogether by utilizing invariant polynomials to extract the ground truth signal in a more direct way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, the asymptotically fastest known algorithm for minimum weight bipartite matching [A] uses an interior point method, which means it's also doing Riemannian optimization in some sense.[A] https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-achieve-absurdly-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, I’ve always wondered if the assignment problem could be solved as continuous optimization. I’m familiar with manifold optimization but didn’t realize the permutation matrix could be expressed as a manifold.Has this been applied to networks like DETR for object detection? I’ve never been clear on how they made the Hungarian algorithm differentiable (and it seems like their approach has issues).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603443</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Fold and Monoids" discusses the concept of folding in functional programming, primarily focusing on its relation to monoids. It explains how folding is a technique used to reduce a structure (like a list) to a single value by recursively applying a binary function. The article outlines the properties of monoids—associativity and an identity element—making it clear how they facilitate the folding process. Through examples and code snippets, it illustrates different types of folds, such as left and right folds, and emphasizes their benefits in creating clean and efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure why the article has to mention monads? I mean there’s the (mathematically correct) joke that »monads are monoids in the category of endofunctors«, but understanding that requires getting elbow deep into category theory, and if you’re not one of the maybe 10 people in the world gifted that way has zero practical use when programming.&gt; A monad is a monoid over a set of curried functions.Is that so? Sounds very wrong to me. If we want to go the monad joke way, monads have to have an operation (a -&gt; m b) that composes, but those are just normal functions, and there’s nothing curried about it. It’s a statement that one could bend enough so it’s kind of right, but what it really does is raise eyebrows.&gt; Monads force sequential processing because you set up a pipeline and the earlier stages of the pipeline naturally must run first.No, a counterexample is the (esoteric) reverse state monad, where values flow the normal way but state comes from the results of future computations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A monad is a monoid over a set of curried functionsI think this statement will have two kinds of readers. People who are not familiar with monads, for whom it'll fly right over their heads, and people who are familiar with monads, who will be annoyed at its inaccuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice property of monoids is associativity, which allows for some interesting incremental algorithms, e.g. by using balanced trees: If the fold of × on a list is computed in clever way, the fold of × on a list where one element is modified can be computed in logarithmic time, given the computation of the first list.A good example for a monoid are strings with the string concatenation operation! This is used a lot in text editors. Homomorphisms are also of practical relevance here.If × is a commutative group operation (i.e. inverse elements exist and a×b=b×a), that can even be done in constant time in a trivial way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606927</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of Latin phonetics, specifically focusing on the pronunciation of Latin sounds and their historical development. It offers detailed explanations of the components of Latin pronunciation, such as vowels, consonants, and syllable structure. The content serves as a resource for students and enthusiasts of the Latin language, aiming to enhance their understanding of how Latin was spoken in its classical form.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only way I made progress in latin was when I bought a few books and started reading, beginning from (modern) children fairy tales. This actually gave me a lasting knowledge which up to this date allows me to read a simple latin text or guess a meaning of a word in English or French (neither language is native to me).Speaking latin of course takes it way further but I think the direction is the same: learn it as a living language not as as a dead one. Starting from declensions and cases gets you nowhere, judging from my friends who learned it in school for years with zero results. Instead, start using the language, if only for reading. Then you can return to grammar later if you ever want to become proficient.I also recommend this guy [1] who not only shares the same approach but apparently have fully dedicated himself to it.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a statement made by Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, indicating that the company will cease hiring software engineers by 2025. This decision comes as part of a broader strategy to shift focus towards enhancing efficiency and integrating artificial intelligence into operations. The article explores the implications of this move for the tech industry, including potential challenges for job seekers and the growing trend of automation in software development. It also highlights the evolving landscape of talent acquisition in tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current SFDC software engineer - this is just cover for a widespread engineering hiring freeze since the layoffs in January 2023. There's a ton of pressure to control costs after the near shareholder revolt that caused the layoffs.The public nature of the announcement is certainly marketing for our AI offerings as well, but at this point I think most engineers are just worried there will be additional layoffs, in the event management cannibalizes product for short term stock gains again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Salesforce for 4 years, and during those years the company made a massive deal about:2020: the first AI craze, introducing “Einstein” as their name for their analytics platform, and officially changing the corporate vision to being the “No. 1 AI CRM company”.2021: Now it’s all about “Customer 360”, i.e. account-based marketing, i.e. what basically everyone else does without such a memeable name. You wouldn’t believe the number of slide decks I had to sit through with all our little product logos orbiting this stock art character straight out of Women Laughing While Eating Salad.2022: Never mind, now we’re betting the company on a real-time unified database called Genie, which was neither real-time nor unified (and eventually not called Genie either). Got sued for that one.2024: AGENTS. AGENTS EVERYWHERE. WE ARE AN AGENT COMPANY NOW.So, let’s see how this holds up in the face of the next hot thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of their sales drive. We are absolutely assaulted by their sales reps trying to sell agentforce. They wine and dine non-technical executives and push the "ai agents will do everything" story. He is just reinforcing this narrative. Nothing to see here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639417</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses "Belshazzar's Clock," an art project by the artist David Karliner that explores the themes of time, history, and storytelling. The project is centered around a conceptual clock that visually represents the passage of time while incorporating elements related to the biblical story of Belshazzar’s feast. It merges interactive art with cultural commentary, inviting viewers to reflect on historical events and their relevance today. The post further elaborates on the artistic process, materials used, and the concept's deeper philosophical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweet hack, thanks for sharing. I remember playing in the dark with luminous paper as a kid - If I remember correctly, I would take a hacked up disposable camera and put various objects in front of the paper before triggering the flash.I imagine that you could improve the consistency and readability some by modeling the state of each pixel of paper. That way when the drum comes around you can compensate the exposure per pixel based on the current state to achieve better uniformity of display. In this way you could do exposure compensation on each row of output to make the display equally bright top to bottom. This would be similar to how a "no-refresh" epaper display works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure if you can get this where you are, but I've personally used some of these glow powders, and they get very bright: https://unitednuclear.com/glowinthedark-items-c-101_45/I've had Aqua and Green, and they look gorgeous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks cool, but if the "writing on the wall" is only supposed to be the current time, there are enough (much more mundane-looking of course) alternatives, e.g. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Emlimny-Digital-LED-Projection-Al...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633035</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses multiplicative infinitesimals within the context of non-standard analysis and their applications in mathematics. It explains the concept of infinitesimally small numbers that are greater than zero but smaller than any positive real number, detailing their properties and how they can be utilized to model mathematical phenomena. The author also examines the implications of these infinitesimals in various mathematical frameworks, including their interaction with real numbers and functions. Overall, the piece serves as a technical exploration of the theoretical underpinnings and potential uses of multiplicative infinitesimals in advanced mathematical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find infinitesimals more intuitive than the formal 'limits-based' approach. I'm currently studying my old degree material but using a fairly interesting book:"Full Frontal Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach" by Seth Braver.I like his readable style. His poetic intro finally gave me an intuition why infinitesimals might be useful, compared to the good old reals:"Yet, by developing a "calculus of infinitesimals" (as it was known for two centuries), mathematicians got great insight into `real` functions, breaking through the static algebraic ice shelf to reach a flowing world of motion below, changing and evolving in time."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm partial to Caratheodory's definition of the derivative, which avoid limits like the infinitesimal approach, but doesn't pull in all the extra baggage that come with infinitesimals (if you do it rigorously).djb (yes, that one) has a pretty good primer on it: https://cr.yp.to/papers/calculus-19970403-retypeset20220326....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the way, the computation involving nonstandard reals is correct (to the best of my ten-year-old memory of studying this stuff). As usual, I will recommend Goldblatt's _Lectures on the Hyperreals_ for an intro to how it all works, and Pétry's "Analyse Infinitésimale: une présentation non standard" for an undergraduate first course in analysis expressed through nonstandard analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637853</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Sean Goedecke's website explores the concept of "ratchet effects" in the context of policy and decision-making. It explains how certain changes can become permanent, leading to unintended consequences that are difficult to reverse. The author discusses examples of ratchet effects in various fields, highlighting their impact on long-term strategies and societal outcomes. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding these effects to navigate complex systems effectively and suggests approaches to mitigate their negative implications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at a "large company", and I don't agree with most of this. Your write-up is highly subjective, and fairly pessimistic.Some people hit the ground running, and teams/organizations/companies can thrive if they find ways to embrace that. Sometimes people get hired at the wrong level, and everyone benefits if some sort of work demonstrates that quickly. I have seen promotions happen based on prudent choices around one's individual strengths, simply by choosing to do a bit of the right work and getting eyes on your capabilities. There is no "one size fits all" prescription for what someone should work on.Having a "shadow lead" can be one of the best situations for your growth, too. Not only do you get the experience leading a thing (for most of what that means, anyway), you may end up with a very strong ally when you knock it out of the park. I had a version of this experience, and I've watched others have it as well.I'm guessing most of the negatives here are based on your personal experience, and for that I'm sorry. Hopefully you can encourage positive changes in your company's engineering culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran face-first into this effect at a successful startup where I started as employee number 9.When everyone can sit around one big table, you don't have to consciously polish your "brand" all the time -- most people have direct experience with you and base their opinions on that. You do good work and you will have a good reputation. If you have a conflict with someone who is a jackass or have a project that fails to launch, people know enough about the context to judge pretty fairly.When there are hundreds of people on the engineering team, especially in a remote-heavy workforce, most people don't have direct experience with you and can only base their opinion of you on what they hear from others, i.e. your reputation. This goes for peers as much as leadership.You have to be aware of how an org changes over time, and how things that were once not important are now essential skills for success.. and decide if any new essentials are skills that you are interested in developing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems generally true in my experience.
Another aspect of this, from personal experience: while it may be easy to move around in a large organization, you risk losing reputational capital. I had a habit of building reputation in some team/platform, then after I no longer found it engaging or there was enough turnover/focus shift, I'd ask to transition to a wildly different team for a new challenge. 
It _is_ fun, but if you opt to start as an IC and work your way up, you're sorta letting the ratchet slip, and if you do it every couple years you may have broad experience, but your reputation (and likely level) will be well below where it could be.Thus, unless you can ramp to expertise really quickly to leverage your skills developed elsewhere, I'd recommend (perhaps obviously) to try to move to peripheral teams where your skills and relationships transfer as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42610021</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The provided link leads to a GitHub repository containing a C++ source code file for a benchmarking suite focused on digit counting algorithms. The code includes various functions to count the number of digits in a given number, as well as performance measurement tools to evaluate the efficiency of different counting methods. It serves as a resource for developers looking to compare the execution time and performance of their digit-counting algorithms within a structured test framework.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is a cute variant that doesn't need lzcnt nor tables, but only works up to 99,999:    (((x + 393206) &amp; (x + 524188)) ^ ((x + 916504) &amp; (x + 514288))) &gt;&gt; 17

This is for integer log 10, but could be adapted for number of digits. It needs a wrapper for 64 bit to invoke it multiple times, but most numbers in a JSON are small, so it might even be competitive; it needs only 4 cycles with enough instruction level parallelism.I gathered this idea from the output of a superoptimizer, it was fun to figure out how it works. For spoilers, see [1].[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/core/s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A latency improvement would be to have digitCountThresholds be indexed by the lzcnt, instead of the result of the other LUT. Increases the size of that lookup table from 160B to 512B though. Funnily enough I've had this approach in a local copy of Ryu when I was working on cutting it down for my purposes. Unfortunately whatever ended up public had cut this out too.edit: some chat messages of me at [0].

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses innovative ideas and concepts for programming languages that could enhance their capabilities and productivity. It emphasizes the importance of exploring novel language designs that address existing limitations and foster better software development practices. Key topics include the integration of new paradigms, improvements in syntax, and the potential for languages to better leverage modern computing hardware. By outlining various concepts, the article encourages programming language designers to think creatively and push the boundaries of what programming languages can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised these are called "programming language ideas". They seem to be solvable, at least many of them, with libraries. For example, my Haskell effect system Bluefin can be seen as a capability system for Haskell.  My database library Opaleye is basically a relational query language for Haskell.  Maybe I'm short-sighted but I haven't seen the need for a whole new language to support any of that functionality.  In fact one gets huge benefits from implementing such things in an existing language.* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bluefin* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing your thoughts.I am also agreeing that relational approach to in-memory data is a good, efffective thought.I recently compiled some of my C code with the sqlite database and I'm preparing to think how the SQL model of my standard code could be used as the actual implementation language of in memory operations.Instead of writing the hundredth loop through objects I just write a SQL query instead with joining with seeing the internal data representation of the software as an information system instead of bespoke code.I was hoping to make it possible to handle batches of data and add parallelism because arrays are useful when you want to parallelise.I was thinking, wouldn't it be good if you could write your SQL queries in advance of the software and then parse them and then compile them to C code (using an unrolled loop of the SQLite VM) so they're performant. (For example, instead of a btree for a regular system operation, you can just use a materialised array a bit like a filesystem so you're not rejoining the same data all the time)I was thinking of ways of representing actors somehow communicating by tables but I do not have anything concrete for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- Looser functions (badly chosen name)Timeouts on calls are, as the OP mentions, a thing in Erlang. Inter-process and inter-computer calls in QNX can optionally time out, and this includes all system calls that can block. Real-time programs use such features. Probably don't want it on more than that. It's like having exceptions raised in things you thought worked.- CapabilitiesThey've been tried at the hardware level, and IBM used them in the System/38, but they never caught on. They're not really compatible with C's flat memory model, which is partly they fell out of fashion.
Capabilities mean having multiple types of memory. Might come back if partially-shared multiprocessors make a comeback.- Production-Level ReleasesThat's kind of vague. Semantic versioning is a related concept. It's more of a tooling thing than a language thing.- Semi-Dynamic LanguageI once proposed this for Python. The idea was that, at some point, the program made a call that told the system "Done initializing". After that point, you couldn't load more code, and some other things that inhibit optimization would be prohibited. At that point, the JIT compiler runs, once. No need for the horrors inside PyPy which deal with cleanup when someone patches one module from another.Guido didn't like it.- Value DatabaseThe OP has a good criticism of why this is a bad idea. It's an old idea, mostly from LISP land, where early systems saved the whole LISP environment state.
Source control? What's that?- A Truly Relational LanguageWell, in Python, almost everything is a key/value store. The NoSQL people were going in that direction. Then people remembered that you want atomic transactions to keep the database from turning to junk, and mostly backed off from NoSQL where the data matters long-term.- A Language To Encourage Modular MonolithsHm. Needs further development. Yes, we still have trouble putting parts together.
There's been real progress. Nobody has to keep rewriting Vol. I of Knuth algorithms in each new project any more. But what's being proposed here?- Modular LintingThat's mostly a hack for when the original language design was botched.
View this from the point of the maintenance programmer - what guarantees apply to this code? What's been prevented from happening? Rust has one linter, and you can add directives in the code which allow exceptions. This allows future maintenance programmers to see what is being allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637304</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;EVE is a high-performance, generic C++ library designed for numerical and computational tasks, particularly focusing on expressing computations using an elegant and convenient syntax. It provides a variety of numerical types and operations, aiming to support both scalar and vectorized computations efficiently. EVE emphasizes ease of use while ensuring performance through features like automatic vectorization and interoperability with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architectures. The library is well-suited for applications in domains such as scientific computing, machine learning, and signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting library, but i see it falls back into what happens to almost all SIMD libraries, which is that they hardcode the vector target completely and you cant mix/match feature levels within a build. The documentation recommends writing your kernels into DLLs and dynamic-loading them which is a huge mess https://jfalcou.github.io/eve/multiarch.htmlMeanwhile xsimd (https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd) has the feature level as a template parameter on its vector objects, which lets you branch at runtime between simd levels as you wish. I find its a far better way of doing things if you actually want to ship the simd code to users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This library's eve::soa_vector is the first attempt I've seen at dealing with the "SOA problem," which is that if you write good, parallel-friendly code, all your types go to hell and never come back because the language can't express concepts like "my object is made from element 7 of each of these 6 pointers." Instead you write really FORTRAN-looking array processing code with no types or methods in sight.Does anyone know of other libraries that help a C++ programmer deal with struct-of-arrays?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EVE is personally my favorite SIMD library in any programming language. It's the only one I've tried that provides masked lane operations in a declarative style, aside from SPMD languages like CUDA or OpenMP. The [] syntax for that is admittedly pretty exotic C++, but I think the usefulness of the feature is worth it. I wish the documentation was better, though. When I first started, I struggled to figure out how to simply make a 4-lane float vector that I can pass into shaders, because almost all of the examples are written for the "wide" native-SIMD size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42603188</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciated this. Lots of solid advice and positive and pragmatic thinking here about aging in the context of being a programmer, and more generally too.I'll take this opportunity to make a related pitch regarding back pain in particular, which can become more of a problem if you are sedentary as so many programmers are: if you have chronic back issues you owe it to yourself to at least check out Stuart McGill's Back Mechanic (https://www.backfitpro.com/books/back-mechanic-the-mcgill-me...). It's very much in line with this post; in particular the idea that you just have to deal with back pain as a fact of life is--for most people--not the case. Please take a look if you are struggling with back pain. The process he lays out takes work but it's based on solid research and experience and it has helped me tremendously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slides:https://github.com/CppNorth/CppNorth_Slides/blob/main/2024/K...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is some good advice, but the way she assumes old people have a lot of money, costs go down because of accumulation of assetes and salaries rise faster than inflation, might not be transferable to everyone in all geographies and generations (only read the slides)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632772</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never noticed this until scrolling through this image gallery, but the design of these ads consistently and prominently highlights the first letters of "More Doctors," which was almost certainly intended to visually reinforce the M.D. association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is interesting that these ads are particularly targeted at women - maybe I am looking too much in to it, but I would guess there was (is) a big gender disparity with tobacco health concerns. These ads are quite different from the Marlboro Man - "tough cigarettes for tough men."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An excerpt from _How to Lie with Statistics_ by Darrell Huff (1954):&gt; Take this one: "27 percent of a large sample of eminent physicians smoke Throaties--more than any other brand." The figure itself may be phony, of course, in any of several ways, but that really doesn't make any difference. The only answer to a figure so irrelevant is "So what?" With all proper respect toward the medical profession, do doctors know any more about tobacco brands than you do? Do they have any inside information that permits them to choose the least harmful among cigarettes? Of course they don't, and your doctor would be the first to say so. Yet that "27 percent" somehow manages to sound as if it meant something.That book specifies many other examples (from this time period in America) of misleading claims that sound statistically significant upon an uncritical, cursory reading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42620720</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Facebook has been censoring stories from 404 Media that focus on the platform's censorship practices. It highlights instances where 404 Media's posts were flagged or removed, raising concerns about freedom of expression and the implications of social media platforms controlling information. The piece argues that such actions not only undermine journalistic integrity but also restrict public discourse around crucial issues of censorship and media accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

Then a magic thing happened: facebook posts that linked to our publication started disappearing within a minute of publication. Including journalists and newspapers. Then posts about how the posts were removed started disappearing. Then facebook accounts - including journalists - writing about this were banned.Sounds like a fairy tale, but it actually happened [2]. I suspect a human overreaction and then automated systems taking over. Anyway, eventually it was escalated really high up and resolved. I can't share any more details unfortunately, even though I'd like to write more about this.[1] English translation: https://cert.pl/en/posts/2024/12/Ad-fraud-on-large-online-pl...[2] Our reaction post about this, in Polish: https://cert.pl/posts/2024/11/blokada-na-meta-stanowisko/.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure about ads, but things are definitely getting worse in terms of health first at FB and now at Instagram. It seems like sex workers (onlyfans models) seemed to have realized the way to skirt the FB community guidelines. There’s no straight porn, but when cooking videos and reels about cute animals suddenly starts morphing into cooking videos but with someone wearing suggestive clothes and animal videos centered around an attractive person doing suggestive things, things go downhill real fast.Recommendation takes higher precedence over your network. And then nefarious actors take over the recommendations. That’s how these products die. The recommendation engine is unfortunately not able to distinguish between regular content and suggestive content, and no amount of reporting/blocking seems to change that. Plus almost all the reports are reviewed and are determined to have not broken any community rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637267</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Non-uniqueness of the Solution to the Problem of Evolutionary Games on Networks" discusses the complexities and non-uniqueness of solutions in evolutionary game theory when applied to networked systems. It critiques the traditional approaches that assume unique solutions and explores how various configurations and interactions in networks can lead to multiple, distinct equilibrium states. The authors aim to highlight the importance of network structure in shaping evolutionary outcomes and urge for a broader understanding of these dynamics in both theoretical and practical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

I find the claim that this represents partial progress slightly misleading, but interesting nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasn't there a paper from Heidi Howard that stated you it's not actually f failures in 2f+1 nodes, but you can actually make the number of nodes that can fail a lot higher, if you have some nodes that have to take part in the quorum (or the prior proposal)? This feels roughly similar?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602347</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of autocorrection features in digital keyboards on writing and communication. It highlights how autocorrection aims to enhance typing efficiency and accuracy, but can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or frustration due to unintended word substitutions and context issues. The author emphasizes the need for users to be aware of these potential pitfalls and adapt their writing habits accordingly. Additionally, the piece examines the balance between relying on technology for assistance and maintaining personal writing style.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It runs on your keyboard, so it is always active no matter what software.I like the idea, but wouldn't that get annoying in contexts where you don't want it? My text editor already annoys me with auto-correct, I'm not sure I want even more of it! Ideally, I think this would be an OS-level feature, but one that only targets specific contexts (e.g. 'rich text' fields, not 'plain text' ones; configurable at an app level).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such ideas generally interfere with usability. I loath any such automations. Some more examples: the menu changes when the mouse hovers over the item; the window size or position changes when the window movement nears the border; Word automatically indent bullet items etc etc. The people designing such systems think they are designing a smart system and the usability is horrible, for me at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cute and clever idea. There's even overriding autocorrect (hit and release Ctrl before the last letter triggering the autocorrect).But while principially possible even in the restricted environment of keyboard hardware it is questionable whether it's a good idea after all. It's not a lot more than a toy, especially because the dictionary is limited and hardcoded.I respect and acknowledge the ingenuity. It must have been a lot of fun to get this working for Pascal Getreuer. Kudos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611971</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses browser hooks, primarily focusing on their role in web security and the challenges they pose. It explains how hooks can be used to manipulate the behavior of browsers and the potential risks they present, such as data leakage and performance issues. The author reviews various types of hooks, including those related to HTTP requests and the DOM, and emphasizes the importance of understanding their implications in the context of user privacy and web application security. Overall, the piece highlights the need for developers and users to be aware of browser hooks and their possible vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; this is probably a mitigating control which would make exploit development much harder in case an exploit chain attempted to leverage one of those RWX areas for executionThis didn't pass the sniff test for me - this doesn't do anything to protect existing RWX regions, and a theoretical attacker that has the ability to inject arbitrary DLLs into the browser process already has access far beyond what the browser could protect.Fortunately, because the browser in question (Firefox) is open source, we can find the change that added this code. This is a bit of a pain because the file has been renamed twice, but here it is: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7d2e74c69253e57fd...And if we read the associated bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1322554) we can see this is described as "policy decision", and this entire section of the code isn't exploit mitigation, but rather intended to block broken third party programs from injecting their buggy and poorly written DLLs into Firefox and causing bugs that users report to Mozilla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The browser is Firefox, and I'm the engineer (no longer at Mozilla) who spearheaded the development of this. AMA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While security software and antivirus deserve all the injection blocking they may get, we must also consider how to bypass these mechanism when it's about reenabling adblocking by injecting DLLs in the browser for request blocking etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601013</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Valve's SteamOS is expanding beyond the Steam Deck, signaling a shift for Windows gaming as it becomes available on various hardware configurations. This move aims to create a more inclusive and accessible gaming ecosystem, allowing players to enjoy Steam games without being tied to Windows.

Many hours just messing with Wine vs I turn on the machine and the game just starts, no fuss.I've owned a Steam Deck not quite since day 1, I'm beyond delighted now that I can just buy and play Steam games. I think I've thrown maybe one game at Proton that I just couldn't get working. And things like the Heroic launcher have made GoG games (most of which already ran on Linux since they just run via DOSBox) easier than ever.Anyone on the fence about keeping Windows around just for games: unless you play online multiplayer that uses kernel anti-cheat, just make the jump. I promise you, almost every game in your library will just work, and almost all of the rest will work after you set them to run with a specific Proton version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bought an Asus Rog Ally X on a recent trip to NYC (i'm not from the US, and the steam deck isn't sold on regular retailers).I can't believe how awful the user interface is, they are bascially installing windows 11 in a computer shaped as a portable console, with really small icons and imprecise touch controls, onedrive and microsoft 365 offers, crazy.If you can install Steam OS on it, all those consolized PCs will end up using native Steam OS, and the next step is the living room (console like desktop pcs).Microsoft must be really thinking about an Xbox OS, or at least a native and usable gaming interface for windows 11. Valve is trying to remove microsoft as a dependency for their bussines. And i think microsoft sees valve as it's bigger competitor on the gaming space, not Playstation as everyone thinks, that's why they are going with the "everything is an Xbox" ads and rumors about "third party xboxes".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I very rarely play games, and for long time I had dedicated windows installation just for steam and friends.This was always annoying experience to reboot, hunt for grub, then half year of windows updates until I was able to enjoy my free time.But thanks to proton, I don't remember anymore when was last time I had to do that, everything just works great on Linux ootb including titles like cyberpunk.For people wanting dedicated (console like) gaming machine steam os looks really promising.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633269</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long ago, I decided to embed a scheme in C++ when I was building a game (nothing AAA or fancy; just a RPG mixed with shmup I wanted to make since I was a kid); when I succeeded, I noticed I never touched the C++ again. So then wondered why I used C++ in the first place and went full for Chezscheme, which is very fast anyway and fast enough for most things. It is fun though. I found the Python case a better fit; it was (is) so slow that actually it makes sense to implement critical path code in C/++.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare to steel? https://github.com/mattwparas/steel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632592</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to look up if he's ok, three decades later. It appears so: https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/olin-shivers/ and https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/923911.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  1.8  A word about Unix standards

  ``The wonderful thing about Unix standards is that there are so many to choose from.'' You may be totally bewildered about the multitude of various standards that exist. Rest assured that nowhere in this manual will you encounter an attempt to spell it all out for you; you could not read and internalise such a twisted account without bleeding from the nose and ears.

  However, you might keep in mind the following simple fact: of all the standards, POSIX is the least common denominator. So when this manual repeatedly refers to POSIX, the point is ``the thing we are describing should be portable just about anywhere.'' Scsh sticks to POSIX when at all possible; its major departure is symbolic links, which aren't in POSIX (see -- it really is a least common denominator).

I often get nostalgic for the old days, but it could be pretty terrible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previously:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21668685https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21668685&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632308</guid></item><item><title>46.

Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure to put those connectors through adequate stress testing.

&lt;p&gt;A study from the University of British Columbia has revealed that spinal cord injuries resulting from mountain biking surpass those from hockey and other high-risk sports. The research highlights the increasing trend of such injuries in mountain biking, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures and awareness among riders. This alarming data underscores the importance of protective gear and responsible riding practices to prevent serious injuries in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to note is that British Columbia, especially the bike park in Whistler, is basically the Mecca of [this type of] mountain biking. For most people around the world it's not a cheap trip, riding there might be something they've dreamt about for years, and they intend to make every minute count, even though they're tired and some of the trails are unlike anything they've ever ridden at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tracks with my own bias as an ER doc. I do feel that the risk of c-spine injuries from mountain biking is understated. As they said in the article, you are especially vulnerable to a hangmans fracture when thrown over the handlebars. I wonder if the ergonomics or geometry of a bicycle could be modified to better protect a rider’s neck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mountain biking needs to be split into two.There is casual off-roading on a mountain bike and there is the dare devil downhill stuff. Very different risk profiles in my mind&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632878</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the six common mistakes, or "sins," that platform teams often commit, which can hinder their effectiveness. It highlights issues such as failing to prioritize customer needs, lacking clear metrics for success, neglecting communication and collaboration with other teams, and not investing in their platform's usability and developer experience. The piece emphasizes the importance of addressing these pitfalls to build successful and efficient platform teams that can effectively support the broader organizational goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Doing k8s/technical stuff.People that should have been working on building products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Platform teams could be highly toxic especially in small startups during initial secops/audit era.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that there was a port of Speedscript to the VIC-20. That was a word processor originally published in Compute! magazine and ported to most 6502-based computers (and MS-DOS, but that was a rewrite in Turbo Pascal as the original was in 6502 assembly language). That probably would have been the best option for the VIC-20 -- Speedscript was a pretty amazing program for something published in a magazine and was better than many word processors for sale in the 1980s.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love retro computing and have used retro systems for contemporary work. This said, the VIC 20 has a horrendous font that I couldn't handle even back in the day. I think DOS with the standard PC font is vastly superior for retro word processing (especially with WordPerfect!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's topic drift, but referencing WP software from that era always reminds me of my OWN experience then.In junior high and high school, my computer was a TRS-80 Color Computer II. We did not have a floppy drive; we used a cassette player instead. SOME software -- games, mostly -- was available on cassette, too, but my word processor was on a cartridge, like an Atari game.This was, at the time, my first and only exposure to word processing software.Then, in my junior year of high school (86-87), I was on the annual staff, and we had an IBM PCjr in the office for our use. It had dual floppies -- the height of luxury, or so I thought.Imagine my shock and dismay when I found that performance in the word processor (moving between modes, say) was AGONIZINGLY SLOW compared to my much-less-fancy TRS-80. See, the word proc on the PC was on a floppy, and so reading other bits of the program meant hitting that fairly slow bus. At home, though, it was on a ROM slotted into the main board, and so everything within the program was basically instant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42621033</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the concept of a pool allocator, a memory management technique that improves efficiency by allocating a block of memory for multiple objects of the same type, rather than allocating and freeing individual objects. It explains the advantages of using a pool allocator, such as reduced fragmentation and faster allocation times, especially in scenarios with frequent object creation and destruction. The text also covers how a pool allocator can be implemented, detailing strategies for managing free and used memory blocks, and provides coding examples to illustrate the implementation process. Overall, it aims to provide readers with a clear understanding of pool allocators and their practical benefits in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This code is very beautifully written, thanks for sharing.However, you should consult the book "C: Interfaces and Implementations" by Dave Hanson, which has a library called "Arena" that is very similar to your "Pool"s, and it shows a few more tricks to make the code safer and easier to read (Chapters 5+6, 6 in particular).D. Hanson's book (written in the 'literary programming' style invented by Donal Knuth) also demonstrates having debugging and production implementations for the same C API to catch memory errors, and his book is from 1997:  &gt; Copyright © 1997 by David R. Hanson

(He used to be a SE professor I Princeton before getting hired by Microsoft, I believe.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you write your own allocator in C, do yourself a favor and use the valgrind API inside it. Its use can be conditional so you can "compile it out". Or should I say it has to be, so you can build the code in an environment where there's no valgrind API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect people don't tend to mention (and TFA does not because it has "general purpose" as a scope) about doing your own allocation arenas is that because a "pointer" is just the name (really number) of an allocated region, this also affords flexibility in the width of those numbers aka "pointer size" that decides your "address" space.So, for example, if you are willing to limit yourself to 64 KiNodes of equal sized objects, a pool like https://github.com/c-blake/bst/blob/main/POOL.c can use an unsigned short 2-byte pointer.  This small address space specialization can give a full 4x space overhead optimization over modern 64-bit pointers.You could even use 8x less with 1-byte pointers if 256 nodes is enough or use bit fields or equivalents for even more fine-grained address space size selection.  Admittedly, linked structures are usually less interesting for very small address space sizes, but this is sometimes useful.  People may complain about arbitrary limits that relate to this kind of optimization, but the linked part could be "small by design" without compromising overall scale { such as for structure within a B-tree node or other multi-level indexing setups }.In any event, I think it is useful to highlight pointer size arbitrariness to junior engineers.  It is often learned once &amp; immediately forgotten behind an onslaught of general purpose-ness (&amp; pointer type systems/syntax).  Relocation ideas also relate.  E.g., if all the pointers are implicitly indices into a (small?) array, and all the code needs a "base address" of that array to get a VMem address, then you can relocate the whole bundle of objects pretty easily changing only the base address.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42605848</guid></item><item><title>3.

In that game, you can annotate the maps, and the world map with battle annotations is really special with lots of memories of victories and defeats. Alas, no dice.I suggest you do this for blueprints! The first thing I'm going to do is take my favorite space platforms and outposts and make posters - the colored block imagery is really artful.And, if you want a real challenge, you could parse the end-game uploads (galaxy) if available, or save files themselves.Or, slightly less ambitious - a game mod that generates links to this site directly.Very nicely done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if you could add in the production / consumption rates of various machines into this and have the visualizer show bottlenecks and other data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thank you for the artistic contribution to the factorio community!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks awesome.What I would love to see either as something leveraging this, or built in to this, is if you prompt stagehand to extract data from a page, it also returns the xpath elements you'd use to re-scrape the page without having to use an LLM to do that second scraping.So basically, you can scrape new pages never before seen with the non-deterministic LLM tool, and then when you need to rescrape the page again to update content for example, you can use the cheaper old-school scraping method.Not sure how brittle this would be both going from LLM version to xcode version reliably, or how to fallback to the LLM version if your xcode script fails, but overall conceptually, being able to scrape using the smart tools but then building up basically a library of dumb scraping scripts over time would be killer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks very cool and makes a lot of sense, except for the idea that it should take the place of Playwright et al.Personally I'd love to use this as an intermediate workflow for producing deterministic playwright code, but it looks like this is intended for running directly.I don't think I could plausibly argue for using LLMs at runtime in our test suite at work...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks really cool, thanks for sharing!I recently tried to implement a workflow automation using similar frameworks that were playwright or puppeteer based. My goal was to log into a bunch of vendor backends and extract values for reporting (no APIs available). What stopped me entirely were websites that implemented an invisible captcha. They can detect a playwright instance by how it interacts with the DOM. Pretty frustrating, but I can totally see this becoming a standard as crawling and scraping is getting out of control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942</guid></item><item><title>6.

It’s systemic —- MS provides a “best fit” code mapping from wide Unicode to ASCII, which is a known, published, “vibes-based” mapper. This best fit parser is used a lottt of places, and I’m sure that it’s required for ongoing inclusion based on how MS views backward compatibility. It’s linked in by default everywhere, whether or not you know you included it.The exploits largely revolved around either speccing an unusual code point that “vibes” into say a slash or a hyphen or quotes. These code points are typically evaluated one way (correct full Unicode evaluation) inside a modern programming language, but when passed to shell commands or other Win32 API things are vibes-downed. Crucially this happens after you check them, since it’s when you’ve passed control.To quote the curl maintainer “curl is a victim” here — but who is the culprit? It seems certain that curl will be used to retrieve user supplied data automatically by a server in the future. When that server mangles user input in one way for validation and another when applied to system libraries, you’re going to have a problem.It seems to me like maybe the solution is to provide an opt-out of “best fit” munging in the Win32 space, but I’m not a Windows guy, so I speculate. At least then open source providers could just add the opt out to best practices, and deal with the many terrible problems that things like a Unicode wide variant of “ or \ delivers to them.And of course even if you do that, you’ll interact with officially shipped APIs and software that has not opted out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is kind of unsurprising, but still new to me even as someone who did Windows development (and some Wine API hacking) for a decade around when this W/A mess came about.Windows is like the card game Munchkin, where a whole bunch of features can add up to a completely, unbelievably random over-powered exploit because of unintentional synergy between random bits.I'm happy to see that they are converting the ANSI subsystem to UTF-8, which should, in theory, mitigate a lot of these problems.I wonder if the Rust team is going to need YetAnotherFix to the process spawning API to fix this...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; until Microsoft chooses to enable UTF-8 by default in all of their Windows editions.I don’t know how likely this is. There are a lot of old applications that assume a particular code page, or assume 1 byte per character, that this would break. There are also more subtle variations of this, like applications assuming that converting from wide characters to ANSI can’t increase the number of bytes (and hence an existing buffer can be safely reused), which isn’t the case for UTF-8 (but for all, or almost all, existing code pages). It can open up new vulnerabilities.It would probably cause much less breakage to remove the Best-Fit logic from the win32 xxxA APIs, and instead have all unmappable characters be replaced by a character without any common meta semantics, like “x”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647101</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive demonstration of particle systems, showcasing how particles behave and interact within a simulated environment. Users can manipulate various parameters such as the number of particles, their speed, and other properties to visualize different effects. This resource serves as an educational tool to help users understand the principles of particle dynamics and computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello author here. I'm a little surprised to see this on the front page of Hacker News. This is just a simple demo for my educational programming language Easylang. You can easily edit the code and increase the particle count for example. In the IDE you can then create a link with the code embedded in the URL.https://tiki.li/run/#cod=dVLNbsIwDL7nKT5p0gRDdEGMA9PYM+yO0FT...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built a similar thing that includes forces between particles meant to simulate a sort of fluid or, as you scroll down, a gelatinous solid. There’s a bit of free energy injected to keep things moving so it’s actually a very bad fluid sim, but I think that makes it a better interactive toy in exchange.One of the fun parts of naively n^2 particle simulations is trying to find ways to reduce the algorithmic complexity of collision detection. I remember messing with sweep lines and similar, though I don’t remember what optimizations made it into the final code. [0][0] https://omrelli.ug&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to share mine as well. There's a bit of more interaction between particles but I don't remember the exact logic. Code should be easy to read:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is always an origin to writing something (or aptly, a citation.)"I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."- Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; More and more, the sentences I had in my head were like the sentences I loved in books: they began in one place and ended somewhere you hadn’t imagined them going, though, at each turn, idea seemed to follow idea perfectly naturally. The surprise at the end, as the thought completed itself, seemed wildly exciting: the whole sentence needed to be reëxperienced in this light; waves of unexpected revelations and insights resulted.Verlyn Klinkenborg, author of Several Short Sentences About Writing, calls these “volunteer sentences.” You don’t follow them, you tame them. Take control of your writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing is an interesting process, it seems different for everyone. There are lots of tools and techniques so that is not a surprise.
For me sometimes it's putting together LEGOs, other times it's crafting a puzzle or panning for gold.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence of new fake literary agencies that exploit writers seeking representation. It outlines common characteristics of these fraudulent entities, including deceptive marketing tactics and unrealistic promises of success. The piece emphasizes the importance of writers conducting thorough research before engaging with any agency, providing tips on how to identify legitimate agencies versus scams. Additionally, it highlights recent reports and specific examples of these fake agencies, underscoring the need for vigilance in the literary community to protect emerging authors from potential exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I particularly like this part from the final thoughts:"solicitation is one of the first and most common signs of a scam these days"This is true about most scams these days. So much so that I have been advising non-technical friends and family to stop directly responding to any communication you did not initiate. Instead ask yourself, "how would I go about addressing or confirming this with the supposed source if I hadn't received a message about it?" Also helps with avoiding the encouragement of marketers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen an increase in both warnings about these kinds of scams and cautionary tales by those who've been burned. I'm glad people are raising awareness, but I worry that this is just one more datapoint toward the overall erosion of online trust.It seems like the only way to really combat this is through closed / semi-closed trusted networks, but those tend to become dominated by personalities and difficult for newcomers to break into. The reduced trust in "outside" voices then leads to echo chambers and groupthink. I think we're already starting to see some of this in the kinds of books being put out by the big publishing houses; I don't have hard numbers (and maybe I'm just getting old and cynical) but a lot of recent titles feel extremely generic.There's a subplot in Neil Stephenson's Fall (or Dodge in Hell) where media and other networks are so saturated with false, meaningless, clickbaity, or otherwise negative-value content that they become either less than worthless, or require paid "filters" to extract actual value. I'm getting a sense of being close to that point already and I don't know what the right move is from here to reduce the fracturing of my wider social circles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pretty much the only things that are really important are the last two points&gt;A real agency is highly unlikely to email or phone you out of the blue with an offer of representation or a claim that a traditional publisher is interested in your work (real agents don’t pre-shop manuscripts for authors they don’t represent).&gt;A real agency will not require you to pay anything or buy anything as a condition of representation or publication. Other than the agent’s commission, there should never be a cost associated with rights acquisition.highly unlikely is politespeak for never going to happen unless your self published work is making tens of thousands of sales already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611126</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the life and contributions of Luigi Mangione, an often-overlooked figure in the field of art and history. It explores how his work has been overshadowed or erased from mainstream narratives, highlighting his unique perspectives and the importance of recognizing lesser-known artists and historians.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evan drowns a good point in his own drama. I've moderated against him on a Stack Exchange site before and it's tedious how far he can push the limits. He knows the rules, the process, what's expected, and he knows how lowly moderators react when they the system alerts them to infractions. It's no surprise he's earned himself [another] suspension here.But as a moderator, what the company is doing here is ridiculous and a seemingly flagrant abuse of license. If you take contributions under CC-BY-SA, you damned-well keep the attribution unless the contributor wants to be disassociated from it. If you don't want to be associated with a contributor, delete the account, and the content.You can't pick and choose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course, people, whether criminals or not, should be attributed for their intellectual contributions but there is a bigger point here which people do not say enough:The criminal justice system already wields the responsibility of punishing criminals. Let the convicts go through due process and do their time. The rest of the society should not participate in "delivering justice": obviously not by hitting them or torturing them, but also not by taking away their property or social capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, my ex co-worker who has been convicted of murder and is serving life without possibility of parole has his account untouched [0]. It's surprising because his case was all over the news and tabloids.Not so Fun fact: a second coworker, from the same company, different crime, has also been convicted and is serving 14 years. (Victim died when police shot the wrong person). His stack overflow account is still up.[0]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/968075/gareth-pursehouse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642089</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got one of these too. When I was 6 or 7 I read a book in the school library in which the villains were the "bone people" and the heroes were space explorers. The bone people could read minds, so they could tell everything the heroes were planning and thwart them.Eventually the heroes learn to keep their true thoughts in the back of their minds, where the bone people can't access them, and with this technique they eventually defeat the bone people. It was the best book I'd ever read (up till then!) and I remember practicing keeping my thoughts in the back of my mind.I've been trying for years to find this book again. Anybody have ideas?Edit: it occurred to me that I should try an LLM, so I pasted the above text into O1 and, in a combination of anticlimactic and thrilling, it gave the answer straightaway. The book is https://www.amazon.com/Bone-People-Space-Science-Fiction/dp/... and the title is, er, "Bone People". Thanks ChatGPT!Edit 2: having now read the OP (and it's great), I see that the ChatGPT angle was already in there. But it produced an opposite result in my case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a wonderful story. I've also had an experience of someone in a writing community being able to name a story I read in my youth, it is really a unique feeling to have a distant hazy memory made real due to the wisdom of another. It's a similar feeling to finding the perfect word for an uncertain feeling you've never been able to give voice to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidenote: David Allen Green, the author of this blog,  is a brilliant writer on constitutional law in the UK. It is quite a subject since Britain doesn't have a written constitution.

On average, after running for just 16 hours, it must be offlined for 8 hours to run maintenance tasks such as "scrub", "garbage collect", "trim", and "fsck".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little over a year ago I was having awful sleep hygiene. From time to time, I still wake up at ~2am and just can't find restfulness again.I picked up a simple smart watch that tracks sleep (one of the Garmins, as they are one of the few that protect privacy and don't need to connect to the Internet). I slowly and methodically improved my sleep, and I feel like a different person.I have noticed that if I turn my blue light filter on my screens off, that has a huge impact. Working long days has a huge impact. I take a hell of a lot of magnesium. I need ~20 minutes of outdoor walking a day and I need to eat dinner before 4pm. Lots of other small things that have an impact that I'm probably forgetting.How many of us are just chronically tired?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644204</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Hack Club is a global community and network for student-led coding clubs, aiming to empower high school students to learn programming and develop their creative projects. The platform provides resources, tools, and support to help students start and grow their own coding clubs, connect with peers, and collaborate on projects. It encourages hands-on learning through workshops, hackathons, and a vibrant community where students can share their work, seek advice, and inspire each other. The goal is to cultivate a passion for coding and technology among young learners.&lt;/p&gt;

I was there only in the capacity of being an adult in the room, for health and safety and safeguarding reasons.The entire event had been organised by a single teenager, with mini workshops, hack time and a global show and tell.Kids that attended were not only coders, but musicians and artists as well.The whole event was amazing, with more pizza than I thought it possible to eat.The kids produced some genuinely interesting games, learned some new skills, and had a great time socially.I fully intend to support more events in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HackClub is great. I feel like I aged out of their target demographics recently though.I can share my single and very positive experience with them.
In summer 2020 (I was 18 then), they were going to host/sponsor some hackathons (IIRC), but because of Covid they couldn’t do that so instead they gave away that money to students who had some project idea. If your project was accepted you got $100 for it - but you had to share the result with the community.I applied and got that 100, and used it to make a remote-controlled mobility scooter [0] with my friend. Not the most useful thing in the world but it was ton of fun![0]: https://youtu.be/WWUe42dH6nw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw the Hack Club presentation at the Ubuntu Summit 2024 ("How 30K teenagers build open source software") and it was an unexpected highlight of the conference for me.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related but here's my take on super intelligence or AGI. I have worked with CNN,GNN and other old school AI methods, but don't have the resources to build a real SOT LLM, but I do use and tinker with LLM's occasionally.If AGI or SI(super intelligence)/is possible, and that is an if...I don't think LLM's are going to be this silver bullet solution Just as we have in the real world of people who are dedicated to a single task in their field like a lawyer or construction workers or doctors and brain surgeons, I see the current best path forward as being a "mixture of experts". We know LLM's are pretty good for what iv seen some refer to as NLP problems, where the model input is the tokenized string input.  However I would argue an LLM will never built a trained model like stockfish or deepseek.  Certain model types seem to be suited to certain issues/types of problems or inputs.  True AGI or SI would stop trying to be a grand master of everything but rather know what best method/model should be applied to a given problem.  We still do not know if it is possible to combine the knowledge of different types of neural networks like LLMs, convolutional neural networks, and deep learning...and while its certainly worth exploring, it is foolish to throw all hope on a single solution approach. I think the first step would be to create a new type of model where given a problem of any type. It knows the best method to solve it. And it doesn't rely on itself but rather the mixture of agents or experts. And they don't even have to be LLMs. They could be anything.Where this really would explode is, if the AI was able to identify a problem that it can't solve and invent or come up with a new approach, multiple approaches, because we don't have to be the ones who develop every expert.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO, the word agent is quickly becoming meaningless. 
The amount of agency that sits with the program vs. the user is something that changes gradually.So we should think about these things in terms of how much agency are we willing to give away in each case and for what gain[1].Then the ecosystem question that the paper is trying to solve will actually solve itself, because it is already the case today that in many processes agency has been outsourced almost fully and in others - not at all. I posit that this will continue, just expect a big change of ratios and types of actions.[1] https://essays.georgestrakhov.com/artificial-agency-ladder/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I just don’t understand the article but I really have 0 clue how they go about making their conclusions and really don’t understand what they are saying.I think the 5 issues they provide under “Cognitive Architectures” are severely underspecified to the point where they really don’t _mean_ anything. Because the issues are so underspeficifed I don’t know how their proposed solution solves their proposed problems. If I understand it correctly, they just want agents (Assistants/Agents) with user profiles (Sims) on an app store? I’m pretty sure this already exists on the ChatGPT store. (sims==memories/user profiles, agents==tools/plugins, assistants==chat interface)This whole thing is so broad and full of academic (pejorative) platitudes that it’s practically meaningless to me. And of course although completely unrelated they through a reference into symbolic systems. Academic theater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611099</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the White House's introduction of a Cyber Trust Mark program aimed at enhancing consumer confidence in the cybersecurity of internet-connected devices. This initiative, announced in early 2025, seeks to create a standardized label to identify devices that meet specific security requirements, thereby helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The program is part of broader efforts to strengthen national cybersecurity by encouraging manufacturers to adopt tighter security measures for their products, addressing the increasing concerns over cyber threats and vulnerabilities associated with smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I'm not sure if the public comment period is over (The original proposal is dated August, 2023), but this stands out to me from their paper:    We propose to focus the scope of our program on intentional radiators that generate and emit RF energy by radiation or induction.31 Such devices – if exploited by a vulnerability – could be manipulated to generate and emit RF energy to cause harmful interference. While we observe that any IoT device may emit RF energy (whether intentionally, incidentally, or unintentionally), in the case of incidental and unintentional radiators, the RF energy emitted because of exploitation may not be enough to be likely to cause harmful interference to radio transmissions.

I guess it is the FCC so this makes sense from their point of view. From my perspective, I'd like to see marks indicating:* If the devices can be pointed to an alternate API provider if the company stops supporting* If firmware has been escrowed / will be made available if the company stops supporting* If device data is stored by the company* If that data is certified as end to end encrypted* Some marks for who / how the data is used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool, I'd rather have a stamp that indicates a company will support their product for X number of years, and if they don't, they will release the software as OSS so you can maintain yourself. I have an extremely expensive scale that came with wifi support and an app, only bought it 3 years ago, half the features already don't work because they nuked the app and stopped supporting the scale. did I need a smart scale? Absolutely not, and I don't really need any other "smart" devices the more I think about stuff like this, and now seek to buy "stupid" devices as much as possible. I'm not sure what such security stamps are supposed to provide other than false sense of security, as most things can be hacked eventually with enough determination or someone unknown zero day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bit scary. Knowing how software is developed, I know there's no government program that could actually ensure a device is secure. It's one thing to measure an electronic device's EMI or pump it full of power and see if it catches fire. But black box testing of software is itself a black art, as software security is a lot more complex than [typical] electronic design.The scary bit is that this label is going to be found to be ineffective, and then consumers may lose trust in government-issued safety stamps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636675</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how consumers can avoid the recent price increase for Microsoft 365 subscriptions by exploring alternative options and strategies. It emphasizes that users can downgrade their current plans, switch to a family plan to save costs, or consider other similar productivity tools that may offer better value. Additionally, it encourages users to be proactive in managing their subscriptions and advocates for consumer rights regarding pricing changes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel that convincing people to pay monthly/yearly for something that has minimal monthly recurring expenditure/investment from the provider (unlike utilities, streaming services, etc.) is one of the biggest cons of the modern era.I have Office 2010 on an old computer. While it lacks some modern features of Microsoft 365 (for example, Office 2010 is much, much faster), it still works seamlessly with any files I create in 365. And I only had to pay, once, about the same amount that Microsoft is charging for a year's use of the same suite in the present day.So they throw in a few gigs of OneDrive to supposedly justify the cost? That vendor lock-in is obviously part of the con (see for instance the complete and very deliberate lack of portability of documents created in OneNote, if you don't have the Professional/Enterprise version). And there are innumerable better services out there, many of which are even free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unaware, if you want to use the latest Office Suite (2024), but don’t want to pay a monthly fee, Microsoft still offers a one time purchase [0] for $149.99 which is now cheaper than the (new) one year subscription (with no cloud storage of course).[0] https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/office-home-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it increasingly hard to justify any sort of SaaS subscription these days.  Is the value you get out of Microsoft 365 really that much greater than any of the open source alternatives?  So much better that you let a corporation dictate the terms of your computing environment?It honestly makes me angry.  And I say that as someone who works in the industry for a SaaS company.  The only SaaS I reluctantly pay for is Fastmail and that's only because it's basically impossible to host your own email these days if you care about your email actually getting delivered to all those Gmail and Outlook inboxes out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640180</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the history of Britain's first internet connection, which was established through the efforts of late pioneer Peter Kirstein in the 1970s. It highlights Kirstein's significant contributions, including the creation of the first password on the internet and his role in connecting the UK to ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. The piece emphasizes the importance of these early technological advancements and their impact on the development of global internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That March 1977 map always brings back a flood of memories to this old-timer.Happy nights spent hacking in the Harvard graduate computer center next to the PDP-1/PDP-10 (Harv-1, Harv-10), getting calls on the IMP phone in the middle of the night from the BBN network operations asking me to reboot it manually as it had gotten wedged...And, next to me, Bill Gates writing his first assembler/linker/simulator for the Altair 8080... (I tried talking him out of this microcomputer distraction -- we have the whole world of mainframes at our fingertips! -- without success.)(Edit:) We also would play the game of telnet-till-you-die, going from machine to machine around the world (no passwords on guest accounts in the early days), until the connection died somewhere along the way.Plus, once the hackers came along, Geoff Steckel (systems guy on the PDP-10) wrote a little logger to record all incoming guests keystrokes on an old teletype, so we could watch them attempting to hack the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked for Peter Kirstein for many years - he always had wonderful stories to tell.In the article Peter talks about the temporary import license for the original ARPAnet equipment.  The delayed VAT and duty bill for this gear prevented anyone else taking over the UK internet in the early days because the bill would have then become due.  But he didn't mention that eventually if the original ARPAnet equipment was ever scrapped, the bill would also become due.When I was first at UCL in the mid 1980s until well into the 90s, all that equipment was stored disused in the mens toilets in the basement.  Eventually Peter decided someone had to do something about it, but he couldn't afford the budget to ship all this gear back to the US.  Peter always seemed to delight in finding loopholes, so he pulled some strings.  Peter was always very well connected - UCL even ran the .int and nato.int domains for a long time.  So, at some point someone from UCL drove a truck full of obsolete ARPAnet gear to some American Air Force base in East Anglia that was technically US territory.   Someone from the US air force gave them a receipt, and the gear was officially exported.  And there it was left, in the US Air Force garbage.  Shame it didn't end up in a museum, but that would have required paying the VAT bill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trouble was that it was quite unclear to a researcher, even in one of the research council networking hubs, how to get access to the gateway, and it may have cost.  I gave up trying before going to work in Oak Ridge for the summer (where I was taken aback by the primitive computing, at least "outside the fence").  For some time (mid-80s to early 90s? I don't remember) we were generally dependent on the infamous BITNET email gateway to communicate with the rest of the world from the well-developed UK network.  It was "interesting" to deal with code in a Swedish 6-bit character set sent through the EBCDIC gateway to ISO 646-GB.  (The Fortran Hollerith formats were added interest...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649340</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article narrates the intriguing story of software piracy in Italy from 1983 to 1993, detailing how the lack of regulatory frameworks and the influence of local culture led to a thriving underground software market. It highlights key players, both pirates and legitimate companies, while exploring the impact of piracy on the software industry and its eventual transition towards legal compliance. The piece also discusses notable legal battles, technological advancements, and the role of the internet in reshaping the landscape of software distribution in Italy during that era.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1990, I was 15 years old and a high school student. Factory clones of the ZX Spectrum appeared in stores, and I often visited the stores, looking at the new computers on the shelves. I already had a programmable microcalculator. My mother worked as the head of the department of automated control of industrial production, she received her salary for a month and bought me a ZX Spectrum 48K computer with all the money, for this I am very grateful to my mother. I learned to program in BASIC and assembler. The computer came with a cassette with the games Zynaps, Exolon, Lode Runner, Boulder Dash, Is-Chess, Robin of the Wood. These games were English, exported through Poland. I knew three people in the whole school, owners of the ZX Spectrum, and it was a huge school, 11 thousand students studied there. We exchanged cassettes with games. Then I used the Copy-copy program, it was right on the tape included with my computer! To make a copy of a game, first the game was read from the tape recorder into the computer's memory for 5 minutes, then I put in a clean tape and recorded the game for 5 minutes, then I checked for another 5 minutes (Verify). Sometimes I came across games in Italian. Hello Italy! There were Polish magazines in Polish. In 2002, I started working in a gaming computer club. There were 12 computers connected by a local network. There were Counter Strike, Half-Life, Sims, GTA III, Warcraft and other games. Games and programs were sold in stores and kiosks. I still have a collection of disks. For example, this is a Windows XP Corporate disk, for which only a serial number was needed. I bought this disk in a store for 2 dollars. Now I use Debian 12. I cannot download a Windows disk image, since many sites are not available in Russia. I can only buy a laptop with Windows installed, but it is expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting movie along those lines, although it's about pirating music rather than games. The protagonists live in Naples.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_by_Erry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611818</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading the article I didn’t pick up what any of the advantages are of 28hr days other than being able to communicate with other regions of the world on certain days. I suppose that could be a very important factor for some people who do work in a geographically dispersed area. A few things I would be concerned with are:
1) your SO is not on the same schedule and really for what isn’t a solid reason. I could see this becoming a source of resentment at some point. 
2) you have to cut people out of your life vs explaining the schedule when they don’t understand why. I understand that the lectures would likely get tiresome at some point, but it seems a bit selfish to switch to this schedule when it could become problematic for friends and family members. 
3) I think cardio and total health should be measured and monitored as part of the experiment. It is entirely possible that this schedule can have real benefits for health or at the least not negatively affect your health. You mention that you are able to workout more often and effectively, so it may also be interesting to track your fitness level on the schedule vs 24 hr days. It would just be anecdotal but it would at least be some data.I guess the only other things I would want to know is what factors pushed most to switching schedules? How long do you plan to stay on the schedule? How does your employer handle this schedule change? Or are you self employed/running a business? What do you think the biggest challenges are during the switch aside from being tired at hour 10-11? What does your SO really think about this schedule? The more I think about this, the more questions I have :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been fascinated with alternative sleep schedules since I was very young. My initial interest turned to a fascination when I realized the only positive long-term reports were usually from people trying to sell something: Their book, a sleep plan, or just using their sleep cycle as a social hook to impress others (influencers, basically). All of the forum reports started out optimistic and then ended in disappointment with basically nobody enjoying them after a long time.One of the common themes was that people would think their lives were better at first. A sort of placebo effect. They’d push through the adaptation phase, which was miserable, and when they adapted they felt slightly better. Often this improvement (relative to the miserable adaptation period) was mistake for an absolute improvement because it had been so long since they had a normal sleep schedule.What was really interesting was that most people reported some variation of the same thing: They didn’t realize how much they disliked the alternative sleep schedule until after they stopped it. Some people stuck with it for a long time until life forced them to change (job, marriage, etc). It wasn’t until they went back to normal that they realized how much better it was to just not fight the sunlight and night time that drives us.It would be interesting to see how this person feels at some point in the future if they go back to a normal sleep schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it amusing how the OP has the need to label meals within the day and gripes about how they don’t match when talking to others on a regular 24-hour schedule. They are just meals. You’re hungry, so you eat. It’s a meal.Only one note: OP sounds like a younger person, probably in their 20s. My body was able to take some serious abuse when it came to sleep schedule back then. I had a job that kept alternating between 2-3 day shifts, then 2-3 night shifts, then 2-3 days off. Sometimes I’d not go to sleep for 24+ hours.I’m twice the age now, and I’m still paying for it. My sleep is not great. I have to be very responsible with sticking to my schedule, and waking up anytime after 3 a.m. results in an inability to fall asleep and a day-long headache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639779</guid></item><item><title>22.

Is this expected? I know it's a baseline to demonstrate ease of use rather than SOTA performance, but I am curious.    # (TabPFN)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the long-standing mathematical problem regarding the rationality of the number obtained from the solution to a specific equation involving square roots. This problem, originating from the work of mathematicians like Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the 18th century, puzzled experts for decades until it was finally resolved. The article highlights the intricate mathematics involved, the historical context of the problem, and the significance of the breakthrough in understanding rational numbers and their properties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it quite interesting that pi+e and pi*e are not proven to be irrational (although it's proven that at least one of them is irrational [1]).It would be mind-blowing if either of them were rational numbers, yet it's very hard to prove either way.[1] https://math.stackexchange.com/a/159353&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whoa, good to know that Henri Cohen was involved in this story.He is the co-creator of PARI/GP, the algorithmic number theoretic C library that I used for my thesis (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) as well as four books in Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics (GTM 138, 193, 239 and 240 - most mathematicians achieve fame with just one book in this series).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When asked where his formulas came from, he claimed, “They grow in my garden.”This makes me think of Ramanujan's notebooks. And based on my limited interaction with professional mathematicians, I think there is something to this - some hidden  brain circuitry whereby mathematicians can access mathematical truths in some way based on their "beauty", without going through anything resembling rigorous intermediate steps. The metaphor that comes to my sci-fi-fed mind is that something in their brains allows them to "travel via hyperspace".And this then makes me think of GenAI - recent progress has been quite interesting, with models like o1 and o3 at times making silly mistakes, and at other times making incredible leaps - could it be that AI's are able to access this "garden" too? Or does there remain something that we humans have access to, while AIs do not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644896</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Retrotechtacular: Soldering the Tek Way" on Hackaday explores the techniques and practices of soldering used by Tektronix, a pioneer in the electronics industry. It focuses on the importance of high-quality soldering for developing reliable electronics, detailing the specific methods and tools employed by Tektronix engineers. The piece highlights the meticulous attention to detail required in soldering processes, showcases historical context, and provides insights into the craftsmanship that defines professional electronics assembly. The article serves both as a tribute to traditional soldering techniques and as a guide for enthusiasts looking to improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's real soldering the Tektronix way.[1] This is the soldering technique for Tektronix ceramic terminal strips, which had silver fired into the surface of the ceramic. The solder used was 3% silver. The innards of Tektronix scopes of that era are just beautiful.Tektronix was the first to make oscilloscopes where the screen was calibrated, and you could measure voltage reasonably accurately. Earlier scopes just let you see the general shape of a waveform. So Tektronix had to develop components and techniques to make electronics behave consistently, over a wide range of temperature and humidity, in portable instruments.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB5JqGo1co&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone has tips on lead-free soldering. I basically always see in online forums "just use lead," but never any tips on how to actually become capable on using lead-free solder. Esp. as my son is around a lot, it seems prudent to stay lead-free, even if you can generally handle lead safely. Thanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned to solder electronics using my father's giant Weller soldering gun. 40 years later I was visiting and had to repair a tiny connection on an electronic candle. I felt like Captain Caveman wielding that giant humming pistol with the lightbulb illuminating the work but by cracky I could still do fine work with that monster tool.This was the longest video I have watched on Youtube in ages. The lack of intrusive ads was refreshing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650561</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't get the point in the example of a magnet implanted in the hand. When I drop a screw its either easily picked up with my fingers, or in a place my hand doesn't fit at all. If you really expect to drop small, ferrous objects frequently why not just carry a small magnet, or better yet one of those extending wands with a magnet on the end?The second use case of dragging paper clips is even more confusing. I get the novelty I guess, but that's really worth the risk of the magnet hurting you in some way?They mentioned it being strong enough to pick up scissors or a knife, that seems like a pretty easy way to accidentally slice open the side of your hand. The risk of coming across another strong magnet that snaps onto the meet of your hand also seems like it could be really annoying and painful, like pinching the side of your hand in a drawer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why not just wear gloves with embedded magnets? I don't understand the benefit of implanting the magnet.Implanting seems to come with several drawbacks: infection risk, difficulty of removal if undergoing an MRI, and difficulty passing through security checkpoints.The advantage is... Saving 5 seconds when compared to just wearing a glove with magnets in it? A glove would also likely provide far far better sensing (more and stronger magnets better placed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you misunderstood what Biohacking is and replaced it with body modification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42641109</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the peculiarities of handling NULL values in SQL databases, emphasizing that NULL is not equivalent to zero or an empty string. It explains how NULL affects comparisons, aggregations, and joins, often leading to unexpected results if not properly understood. The author provides examples to illustrate common pitfalls, such as how NULL can lead to false outcomes in conditional statements and how certain SQL functions behave differently when NULLs are involved. The piece ultimately aims to enhance the reader's understanding of NULL handling in SQL to avoid errors and improve database queries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL NULLs aren't weird, they're just based off of Kleene's TRUE-FALSE-UNKNOWN logic!If you want you can read NULL as UNKNOWN and suddenly a whole bunch of operations involving them become a lot more intuitive:1. TRUE OR UNKNOWN = TRUE, because you know you have at least one TRUE already.2. TRUE AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN, because you don't know whether you have two TRUEs or not. It's just out there.3. UNKNOWN XOR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN, because it could darn near be anything: TRUE XOR TRUE, TRUE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR TRUE... Internalizing this is where SQL's use of NULL / UNKNOWN really becomes intuitive.4. (TRUE AND FALSE) XOR (TRUE OR UNKNOWN) = (FALSE) XOR (TRUE) per #1 = TRUE. See, it's consistent, you just need to keep in mind that if you have a lot of known UNKNOWNs they're quite parasitic and your final outcome is likely to be, itself, an UNKNOWN. Just like in real life!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; select null = null; returns NULL, because each NULL is basically a placeholder representing any “unknown value”. Two unknown values are not necessarily the same value; we can’t say that they are equal, because we don’t know the value of either of them.Agreed with all of this, it would probably have been better if they were named `unknown` instead of reusing the `null` keyword.Note also that since Postgresql 15, you can use `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` when creating a unique index [0]. I'm less familiar with other databases.0: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createtable.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Object Oriented Context "null"  is useful to indicate that some object doesn't have value for that property.What's interesting is, do we mean that in our data that attribute has no value? Or do we mean the real-world object represented by the data does not have that attribute?Does null meana) We don't know the value of this attribute 
   for this object, orb) We do know that there is no value for this
   attribute in the real-world object 
   represented by our data.In JavaScript because there is both null and undefined it is easy to assume that undefined means we don't know the value and null means we do know it has no value.EXAMPLE:
The attribute 'spouse'. Some people have a spouse some don't. So what does it mean if the value of the field 'spouse' is null? That we know there is no spouse, or that we don't know who the spouse is if any.In practical terms we can say null means "We don't know" which includes the case that there is no spouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645110</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of double-keyed caching, a technique aimed at optimizing data retrieval in web applications. It explains how this method improves performance by storing cached data under two different keys, which allows for more efficient access and better handling of updates. The post also outlines practical implementation strategies using JavaScript and emphasizes the benefits of reducing redundant network requests. Additionally, it highlights potential use cases and performance considerations, illustrating how double-keyed caching can enhance user experience by speeding up data loading times.&lt;/p&gt;

We (ab)used this to do preloading before it was available in the web platform, e.g. download a JavaScript without executing it:  var js = new Image();
  js.src = 'script.js';
  js.onerror = function(){/* js done */};

Then some browsers started having a separate image cache and this stopped working&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a user, you can use extension like LocalCDN. Instead of having your browser download common libraries and fonts, the extension would intercept the request and serve the local version. Even better in terms of privacy and security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42630192</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the mathematical exploration of the concept of infinity and the different sizes of infinity, particularly focusing on the types of numbers that exist, such as real numbers, rational numbers, and others. It highlights a significant advancement in understanding how many numbers there are by presenting a proof that connects cardinality (the size of sets) with the properties of the continuum hypothesis. The work illustrates the complexities of infinity in mathematics and suggests that mathematicians are making progress towards a deeper understanding of the foundational questions surrounding the existence and classification of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

Links to past threads are just to satisfy extra-curious readers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a trick! Despite the name, the real numbers aren't real at all. Most of them don't exist...Now the computable reals, on the other hand... maybe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But Cantor discovered that natural numbers can’t be put into one-to-one correspondence with the continuum of real numbers. For instance, try to pair 1 with 1.00000… and 2 with 1.00001…, and you’ll have skipped over infinitely many real numbers (like 1.000000001…). You can’t possibly count them all; their cardinality is greater than that of the natural numbers.I take issue with this paragraph. It makes it sound like the infinitude of reals between 1 and 1.00001 is proof there are more reals than naturals. One might think this same fact proves that there are more rationals than naturals...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627270</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities of consumer-grade routers that are powered by underwhelming power supplies. It highlights how these routers can exhibit strange performance issues, including crashes and connectivity problems, especially under heavy use. The piece emphasizes the importance of proper power supply specifications for reliable router performance and warns consumers about the potential risks posed by inadequate power sources, which can ultimately compromise network security and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irrelevant.1. Downstream of the mains power supply are DC-DC converters that run the router hardware. Those contain the filters and capacitance you think you're fixing. Nothing in that router actually cares about mains power quality. They absolutely do not care about perfect sinusoids.2. If you were seeing insufficient power to the router, you would observe crashes and faults -- not slowdowns.3. Two different routers showed the same behavior, which suggests that the fault lies outside the router+power supply and more to do with something common (e.g. network, laptop).The dip shows a reduction in voltage, and a larger one than I would like, but without a scale on either time or voltage, it's difficult to guess if it actually matters. I would suspect not, since the device does boot successfully.  Again, the voltage doesn't matter, since the router runs off its internal DC-DC supplies, not the external power supply.I'm happy that the capacitor and new supply has fixed the issue, but I'm unconvinced by the explanation. Check grounding between inverter and laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Clearly, the router is pulling more current during the dip than the power supply on my solar circuit can supply.&gt;[...]&gt;Ideally, we’d want manufacturers to put capacitance to that effect into their router power supplies or at least routers. But we realise that capacitors cost a few cents each and aren’t really required on stable grid supplies. And manufacturing costs matter.Weird this was being seemingly blamed on "puny power supplies", and that "ideally" manufacturers should be overspecing their power supplies to accommodate his use case. Does he also think manufacturers should "ideally" add a battery to routers on the off chance that there's a transient blackout?More to the point, he supposedly has a "4500W peak solar sinewave inverter", and his router probably consumes no more than 50W. That 50W is unlikely to cause issues with such a system, and even if it was the straw that broke the camel's back, it's weird to blame it on the router, rather than the inverter or the entire system. If you had a take-home salary of $10k, blew it all on gambling, then your card got declined on a starbucks purchase, you wouldn't characterize this as "my coffee habit was using more money than my income can supply".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh. Is that line on the scope a one-time glitch at power up, or does it happen on every cycle?"Rummaging through my old parts box unearthed a power supply that was a bit more powerful than the one that came with the router, and even fit the connector." Is he describing a "wall wart" type power supply? A picture would help. A teardown would help more. There are large numbers of really crappy wall-powered DC supplies available, mostly from China.[1]Look for a UL approval marking and a UL approval number. That indicates at least some attention to quality. UL is mostly concerned about fire safety, but their basic test for power supplies includes connecting it to a load box at the power supply's maximum rating, then running it for a while to see if it overheats. This catches power supplies with exaggerated ratings.Avoid no-name power supplies. This is a well-known headache.[1] https://hackaday.com/tag/wall-wart/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42613758</guid></item><item><title>33.

I disagree.Raspberry Pi offers models ranging from $10 to $120, all readily available — more so than ever.Adjusted for inflation, the original $35 Raspberry Pi Model B (launched 2012) would be $50 today. The Raspberry Pi 5 2GB is also $50 today and vastly outperforms the original, delivering far greater bang for buck.Though I can’t speak to their internal decisions, it’s seems from the outside that they continue to try to maximise the value of the Raspberry Pi while maintaining the original price point.Disclaimer: Co-founder of Pimoroni, one of the first Raspberry Pi resellers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this is a one-off expensive Pi and not an indication of a new pricing strategy. It would be very disappointing if these hacker computers became expensive toys.The article is very feel-good with the carbon credits and all, but the inflating pricing is a disservice to the hacker community.

Get them into Sloan Kettering, Mayo, Duke or OHSU or whoever. Help them look for clinical trials to get chemo past the blood-brain barrier (I've heard some promising things in this area, though I'm not sure if it's being tested on humans yet). If they have a family that's taking care of them, offer to help them. Even just a grocery trip a week or something would be a massive help (obviously this depends on how close you are to them but you get the picture). Hell, offer to just hang out with your friend for a few hours so the family can get out and decompress for a bit if they need to.Don't let them fall into the false hope of "I might have 5-10 more years". The person I knew fell into that and did absolutely nothing they wanted to do before they died because they were in denial and kept holding onto the expectation that they'd get better.If they have money, every cockroach will come out of the woodwork trying to get a piece. Watch out for them if you can.I know someone who got scammed out of a very substantial amount by a real brain surgeon in America(!!!), who referred them to a guy that sold a bogus device which he claimed would "destroy the tumor" (no FCC sticker on it and the entire thing was controlled by a Raspberry Pi when I disassembled it). Brain surgeon had a bunch of FDA complaints against them too and performed it in one of the poorest cities in the country, across the street from a burnt out apartment building. The local pharmacy had a constant police presence because of armed robberies for the drugs. These details scream sketch to normal people, but normal people aren't going to be dying of brain cancer in the foreseeable future. Desperate people will do crazy things if they think it offers some hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know when someone’s faced with certain death they’ll do almost anything they can to survive if only for a little bit longer, but this thread full of personal antectodes and largely non-reproduced effects from random pubmed articles is the hackernews equivalent of essential oils or smth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should ask them if they want you playing doctor.I have a chronic disease, not fatal, and totally manageable. But the most annoying thing is when someone finds out and suddenly pretends to be the expert.Of course my doctors and I investigating it for years were completely wrong! I should’ve ate more apricots!Please just check with them if they want their limited time spent like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649996</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;"A Supermarket in California" is a poem by Allen Ginsberg that explores themes of consumerism, identity, and the connection between past and present. Set in a bustling supermarket, the poem reflects on the speaker's observations of shoppers and the overwhelming nature of modern life while invoking the spirit of the poet Walt Whitman. Through vivid imagery and introspective commentary, Ginsberg examines the search for meaning in a commodified world, blending social critique with personal longing and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

So I had to hang out in front while my mom shopped.Eventually I turned 10 and got a military ID and could go into the supermarket. My mom would buy a huge pile of groceries (because it was a bit of a drive to the base and she only shopped every 2 weeks), and the cashier's fingers would just fly over the mechanical keyboard. I'm surprised their fingers didn't bleed from doing that all day.The laser scanners are sooo much better.Can you imagine these days leaving your six year old outside while you shopped?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639691</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Poka-yoke is a Japanese term meaning "mistake-proofing," which refers to design mechanisms that help prevent errors or defects in manufacturing and other processes. Developed by Shigeo Shingo, it aims to increase quality and efficiency by creating systems that make it difficult or impossible to make mistakes, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. The concept involves using simple, low-cost devices or methods to highlight potential errors or guide correct actions, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Poka-yoke techniques can be applied in various settings, from industrial production lines to everyday tasks in order to minimize the risk of human error.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my industry, we mostly use the term to refer to mechanical features, typically keyways, that prevent connectors from being mated incorrectly.Suppose you have a module with 50 pins worth of connectors, but because some of the signals are in different harnesses which get installed at different times, you can't just use a 50-pin connector. For this example let's say it's sensible to break it up as 20+20+10.You wouldn't use two identical 20-pin connectors since they carry different signals. You probably do want to use the same family of connectors so they use common pins and have a common board footprint. So you get connectors which are the same except for having different keyways, and are often molded of different colors of plastic, by convention.If you've ever been working on a vehicle and seen identical-looking connectors where one's black and one's gray, look closer. Along with a color difference, there's a notch on the housing in a different place.This increases the number of parts that must be stocked, but the decrease in assembly errors is worth it. (And they all share the same tooling, so the manufacturing complexity isn't bad.)Note that this isn't required if the connectors aren't candidates for mismating in the first place. If they appear in completely different places on the harness, then it's totally fine to reuse the very same connector for the amplifier speaker signals in the trunk, and the steering column (turnsignal stalks and stuff) module signals up front. This reduces parts count without increasing errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" - Murphy"Dubble check that spelIng" - MuphryMurphy was a rocket engineer. One day their assistant plugged in a non-keyed connector upside down. It was very easy for that to go wrong.Another time, in another place, a rocket assembly worker hammered in a keyed connector - upside down. It was harder for that to go wrong, but, uh, life finds a way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like collecting little ideas like this. Slightly meta-ironically I'd describe the genre as "just abstract enough to be useful nuggets of knowledge" and I have an org file full of them. The hard part is I don't know any better name for such "concepts" so I can't search for other people's lists.Does anyone else keep a similar collect or have advice for finding more?(For example Gurwinder sometimes posts lists like this: https://www.gurwinder.blog/p/30-useful-concepts-spring-2024 - that's what I'm talking about.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42643532</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Zoom fatigue," a term that describes the exhaustion many people feel after extended video conferencing sessions. It identifies four primary causes of this fatigue: excessive eye contact, the cognitive load of processing visual information, the challenges of interpreting non-verbal cues, and the feeling of being trapped in a screen. To mitigate this fatigue, the article suggests several solutions, such as taking breaks, reducing the number of video calls, using audio-only communication when possible, and reorienting the camera to lessen eye contact pressure. These strategies aim to enhance the virtual communication experience and promote mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never turn on my camera, and minimise the video feeds of everyone else (as in, tab away). Problem solved.I find some people are very pushy about wanting “everyone to have their camera on”, but I just make various excuses (I lost my camera, the laptop is upside down for better cooling, etc). 5 years now, top of the tech tree (to explain that this has not been a CLM), but still making those same silly excuses ;-)You’d think someone might have guessed by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never liked video calls. Or even phone calls for that matter. I put up with them because most of the rest of the world wants to be remote these days. I'm very much an “in person or in writing, not comfortable with the middle ground” sort.Seriously considering a change in career (away from dev &amp; related tech) to something where I and colleagues have to be in the same place by necessity at least some of the time (perhaps some sort of lab work?) but that means a drop in salary temporarily as I'll likely have to start much nearer the bottom than I am now…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I strongly suspect 'outreach' personnel have quotas for booking meetings, regardless of outcome. VC backed infra projects will have full teams with no real customers, just a promise of future profitability. At least some of those seats are dedicated setting up meetings. When they are successful, it is often one VC backed startup trading funds with another VC backed project. End users who pay are less important than the hype. The merry-go-round continues.An annoying waste of time when you are self-funded and their offers assume you have a huge budget. I'm fatigued. The "B" in B2B implies at least one party is doing business with users.Worse yet are the self-styled "marketing experts" or managers of "influencers" who balk at commission structures, insisting on upfront payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42608540</guid></item><item><title>42.

Whenever you touch this kind of data, regulatory regimes like HIPAA may apply, and you need to be extremely careful. There's not a HIPAA compliance or even a privacy policy statement available on your front page.See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-reg... as a starting point. We might be able to recommend a lawyer to you if you tell us which state you're located in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to repeat other comments here; but this app smells of a very dangerous attitude: Built with love by novices with grand intentions, with complete blindness to the real consequences that happen when novices are ignorant in their field.If your goal is to "find a learning project," I suggest finding a very different "learning project." Otherwise, keep "Kate's app" private, word-of-mouth, invite-only for under 20 people.The 1980s and 1990s are long-gone, you can no longer "learn as you go" when the consequences of your application malfunctioning have real-world implications.---A few years ago, my employer used an HR app that appeared built by a novice. In that time period; they sent me a PDF with tax information for half the people in the company; and then they royally screwed up the tax information sent to the IRS for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you know your app is legal to distribute in each country you are distributing in? Anything with the word “medical” in it can be a potential legal mess due to well intentioned but ultimately difficult to manage issues.If you can’t answer that question you really need to listen to the people telling you to take it down until you can work it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42646922</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while ago I used whisper (or rather an OSS subtitle tool that used whisper, sadly can’t remember the name; it also converted burned in subs to proper ones via OCR) to generate subtitles for a season of a Show (4 season DVD set, 1 had proper subs, 2 burned in subs, 1 no subs -.-), too old and not popular enough to have "scene" subs, it worked impressively well. The most memorable thing for me was that a character’s scream was properly attributed to the correct character.I’d love a feature like that for Jellyfin eventually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an art to subtitling that goes beyond mere speech-to-text processing. Sometimes it's better to paraphrase dialog to reduce the amount of text that needs to be read. Sometimes you need to name a voice as unknown, to avoid spoilers. Sometimes the positioning on the screen matters. I hope the model can be made to understand all this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently used some subtitles that I later found out had been AI generated.The experience wasn't really good to be honest - the text was technically correct but the way multiline phrases were split made them somehow extremely hard to parse. The only reason I learned AI was involved is that it was bad enough for me to stop viewing and check what was wrong.Hopefully it's an implementation detail and we'll see better options in the future, as finding subtitles for foreign shows is always a pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644015</guid></item><item><title>44.

The change in tone from poem to poem, and that general vibe makes for an interesting read. They seem very honest.It is interesting that Wikipedia describes him as a Hippy. I somehow got it into my head that he was the last beatnik. But, I can’t find any support for this theory in a quick googling, and I’m pretty bad at literature. So, I wonder where I stumbled across that idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of Nothing But Flowers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iiGqBfyLawFeels like a depth optical illusion - the meaning can change based on perspectivehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_illusionAlso reminds me of Becky Chambers' Monk and Robot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42646932</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has launched its own brand of world models aimed at enhancing machine learning and AI capabilities. These models are designed to create a compressed representation of environments that can be utilized for training in various applications, such as robotics and video game development. By using these advanced models, developers can streamline the training process, making it more efficient and effective. The release highlights Nvidia’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI technology and integrating it deeper into various industries.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this correct then that either the models cannot be used in the EU, or we'll get to know where the training data came from?[1]: https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/en/procedure-fil... - "General-purpose AI systems, and the GPAI models such as ChatGPT they are based on, must meet certain transparency requirements including compliance with EU copyright law and publishing detailed summaries of the content used for training."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why go to techcrunch and not directly to their only source of information on this?

&lt;p&gt;The article explores potential buyers for the Raspberry Pi 120, a hypothetical future model of the Raspberry Pi, by considering its features and applications. It discusses various use cases, such as education, hobbyist projects, IoT applications, and commercial uses in industries like robotics and automation. The author reflects on the popularity of previous Raspberry Pi models and speculates on their continuing relevance in enabling creativity and innovation among technologists, educators, and makers. Additionally, it addresses the future of hobby computing and the importance of keeping the platform accessible to a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You develop your application on an 8GB model and find out that 16GB is much better.  You can choose to port it to some other OS with some other hardware if you like or buy a 16GB Pi 5 and save the effort. The choice is now there.What's so great is that it's all up to you. There are "smaller" or older Pis still being made. More for more is fairly reasonable.If you have a sort of inbuilt bias against "buying second best" that you might consider this a price increase. I have that feeling often. I don't want the second best camera .... and that ends up leading me into stratospheric prices as I finds better and better things.   Fortunately I know this and realise that when I am doing it it's because I don't have a clear use in mind for the item - hence I can't decide what's "enough" so the answer  is not to buy it at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lesson I've learned over the years of purchasing several Raspberry Pi's is this: Unless you're in the need to integrate a project through the GPIO's interface I would be better off spending on one of those (second hand) mini-pcs by lenovo, dell, etc. Even if you want to use it for a low budget mini server, performance for the buck is way better off with a mini pc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Raspberry Pi has been a bad deal for a long time now. Persistent shortages drove the real-world price up (no one was selling them for MSRP) and for some reason they never came back down.Cheap tiny PCs are better at the high end, and increasingly-capable microcontrollers are better for tinkering. The Pi sits in a weird niche, and its popularity these days is largely based on inertia and network effects.It's been a slow, strange shift away from a $25 computer meant for kids to learn programming and electronics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642992</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to delete a Facebook account or page, detailing the differences between the two processes. It explains the implications of deleting an account, including the loss of data and inability to recover it once the deletion is finalized. The guide walks users through the necessary steps, emphasizing the importance of backing up any important information before proceeding. Additionally, it highlights the options available for temporarily deactivating an account as an alternative to permanent deletion.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s only a matter of time before you don’t even have to interact with their AI tools to kick off them showing you yourself in generated content. No thanks! They make it damn obscure to find too. I had to click a direct link to the option from their help pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I deleted my Facebook account back in 2015. I was in high school and going through a deep depression/mental break down. I remember feeling so much relief as the days went on. I don't think I was ever designed to handle social media properly. I doubt I'm the only one either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I deleted my FB account a long long time ago and then a few years later I wanted to make a new one for business reasons and they blocked me from doing so.I’m not saying don’t delete your account - I still don’t have one, but be aware that it may not be as simple as just creating a new one if you change your mind in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649887</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on the move (nomad) for close to 3 years now. First year full airbnb. Second year, mostly airbnb. This third-year, I have around $800 of airbnb credit that I am yet to use. And I really want to use it. Airbnb has just became the worst of both worlds: 1. For hotels, it has an inferior booking experience and is more expensive. So I just book with booking.com and 2. for longer rentals, the experience is both unpredictable and the price are x2-3 times higher.Case in point, I am in a Vietnamese city right now. I looked airbnb and the places I see average $500-700/month. Instead, I did a short walk around the coworking space I rented at and found a comparable place for $200/month. Big Plus: I got to see the place BEFORE placing the non-refundable one month rent. The place is literally across the coworking space (just have to cross the street).As an extremely lazy person that prefer to use online methods than asking random people, I really wonder who is still using Airbnb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;“In this case, the guest booked on the evening of Jan. 7, after the wildfires had started,” a company spokeswoman told The Post.&gt;However, she added that the company has “contacted the guest to issue a full refund as a goodwill gesture” due to the “fast-moving situation.”https://nypost.com/2025/01/08/lifestyle/airbnb-user-fumes-af...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airbnb will always side with the host if possible, because hosts are much more valuable to their platform than guests. I had a similar situation a couple years ago when Santa Cruz was hit with catastrophic flooding; despite providing them with plenty of evidence that the place I was trying to visit qualified for a refund, Airbnb refused to give me one (telling me I needed to get one from the host, who was also not obliging) in clear violation of their policies. They also later deleted a negative review I left detailing said interactions with the host   as "off topic." Thankfully there's always the option to do a credit card chargeback, but such experiences make it pretty clear how little these platforms actually care about their customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42643254</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of having a "spot the difference" superpower, emphasizing the importance of keen observation in various aspects of life, including personal development, decision-making, and fostering creativity. It highlights how this ability can lead to better problem-solving skills and enhanced awareness of surroundings. The author encourages readers to cultivate this skill by practicing mindfulness and reflection, which can ultimately lead to greater insights and improved cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a local bar they had a game machine, and if you got a high score on any of the games, your tab for the evening was free.One of the games was a "spot the differences" between two pictures with an ever decreasing timer for each round. Using this trick I was able to easily surpass the high score, and garner a crowd watching me perform this mind numbing feat.Probably my peak fame right there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We got a magic eye book when I was maybe 6 - some time early elementary school. After learning how to do it, and also trying it by crossing my eyes to see an "inverted" image, I started doing it whenever I saw some repeating pattern IRL. It was most interesting when it was slightly uneven, for example a fence with sloppily applied vertical planks. Doing the magic eye would make it seem like some of them are closer to you than others. Eventually I tried the same on those "spot the difference" games since well it seemed kinda obvious to try, and I was blown away that it accidentally gave me that "superpower". I think that was pretty smart for a 6yo. Has only gone downhill ever since. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I discovered this trick independently about a decade ago, to use cross-eyed viewing to easily spot differences between two similar images. Like you said, the parts that mismatch appear to shimmer and be unstable, making them obvious.However, I feel eye strain from doing it, so I prefer other methods. 99% of the time, I do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_comparator instead, just switching between two images with zero flicker and zero displacement offset. Also with both eyes, it's easier to spot certain kinds of subtle differences like color shifts, JPEG-like compression artifacts, tiny differences in antialiased renderings, etc.One benefit of the cross-eyed method, though, is that you can difference videos. But the use case for that is rarer than differencing images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655870</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Anna's Archive discusses the significance and implications of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) in the digital age. It explains how ISBNs are vital for cataloging and identifying books across various formats and platforms, emphasizing their role in facilitating access to literature. The piece also highlights the challenges posed by the rapid digitization of books, including issues of copyright, accessibility, and the evolving nature of book publishing. Furthermore, it advocates for open access to literature and reflects on how ISBNs can affect the availability and distribution of books in a more interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see that bounty at the bottom, so tossing away my chances here, but this visualization is just asking to be mapped onto a Hilbert Curve. [0] When you "stripe" the data like this, points that are sorted close together could end up pretty far apart, since a distance in the Y axis skips an entire row of data as you move down, rather than a distance in the X axis which is 1-to-1 with the source data.If you map it onto a hilbert curve, the X and Y axis mean nothing, but visually points that are close together in the sorted list, will be visually close together in the output image.Since the first part of an ISBN is the country, then the second part is the publisher, and the third part is the title, with a check sum at the end, I would remove the checksum and sort them each as a big number. (no hyphens)You should end up with "islands", where you see big areas covered by big publishing countries, with these "islands" having bright spots for the publisher codes.Bonus points for labeling these areas!I set up something a while ago [1] for an interview that does this with weather data. It makes the seasons really obvious since they're all grouped together.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve[1] https://graypegg.com/hilbert (https://github.com/graypegg/hilbertcurveplayground code if anyone wants to go for the prize using this! Please at least mention me if you decide to reuse this code, but I can't stop ya lol)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing is, ISBNs aren't hierarchical --- they are bought in blocks (or even individually at an exorbitant markup, says the guy who bought one to reprint a single book), so this doesn't show anything really interesting/useful.A visualization using LoC or even Dewey Decimal would be far more useful, esp. if it also linked to public domain and copyright-free repositories/lists, say an interactive and visual version of John Mark Ockerbloom's:https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anna's archive is one of the wonders of the world. If we almost destroyed our species but Anna's archive endured, there would be hope for a relatively expedient reconstruction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652577</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote about my experience working as a software developer and being black in the industry and I was lucky to have it published on BBC [1].What immediately followed, every large company reached out to have me work as a consultant for their diversity program. I found it fascinating that they had a team of DEI experts in place already. Like what makes one an expert?In addition to my job, I spent nights developing programs trying to help these companies. Some folks right here on HN shared their successful experiences and I presented it to several companies. I was met with resistance every step of the way.Over the course of a year and hundreds of candidates I presented, I've managed to place just one developer in a company.However, most these companies were happy to change their social media profile to a solid black image or black lives matters. They sent memos, they organized lunches, even sold merch and donated. But hiring, that was too much to ask. A lot of graduates told me they never even got to do a technical interview.Those DEI programs like to produce a show. Something visible that gives the impression that important work is being done. Like Microsoft reading who owned the land where the campus was built [2] in the beginning of every program. It eerily reminds me of "the loyalty oath crusade" in Catch-22.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23669188[2]: https://youtu.be/87JXB0t6de4?si=wtnQtBOE-fs4V7gR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am Wasq'u (a tribe in the PNW), I am connected to my tribe, and I am one of a handful of remaining speakers of the language. I am really tired of being caught in the maw of people fighting about my identity, what I am owed, and to some extent what place my identity has in society.To the pro-DEI crowd: I have some hard truths for you. Actual change requires commitment and focus over an extremely long period of time. That means you have to choose probably 1 cause among the many worthy causes, and then invest in it instead of the others. You can't do everything. The problems that afflict my community are running water, drug addiction, lack of educational resources, and secular trends have have made our traditional industries obsolete. I am not saying that land acknowledgements and sports teams changing their names from racial slurs are negative developments, but these things are not even in my list of top 100 things to get done.We all want to help, but to have an impact you must have courage to say no to the vast majority of social issues you could care about, and then commit deeply to the ones you decide to work on. Do not be a tourist. I don't expect everyone to get involved in Indian affairs, but I do expect you to be honest with me about whether you really care. Don't play house or go through motions to make yourself feel better.When you do commit to some issue, understand that the biggest contributions you can make are virtually always not be marketable or popular—if they are, you take that as a sign that you need to evaluate whether they really are impactful. Have the courage to make an assessment about what will actually have an impact on the things you care about, and then follow through with them.To the anti-DEI crowd: focus on what you can build together instead of fighting on ideological lines. The way out for many minority communities in America is substantial economic development. In my own communities, I have seen economic development that has given people the ability to own their own destiny. It has changed the conversation from a zero sum game to one where shared interests makes compromise possible. If you want to succeed you need to understand that your fate is shared with those around you. In-fighting between us is going to make us less competitive on the world stage, which hurts all of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a PoC, and stuff like this reads extremely bizarre to me. On the one hand, you're acknowledging rolling back DEI initiatives in part because of the "political landscape," and that you were already committed to diversity on your teams. That's all well and good, but then, why the initiative in the first place? It seems to me you're doing at least 1 thing here, and acknowledging that such DEI program was performative in the first place. This kind of announcement seems extremely self defeating and unlikely to please anyone and piss off just about anyone that cares about this in any way shape or form, on either side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657901</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the cultural impact and legacy of the Japanese film "Battle Royale," highlighting its role in shaping the survival genre long before the emergence of global hits like "Squid Game." It discusses the film's controversial themes of violence and survival, its critique of societal structures, and its influence on both Japanese and international media. The piece also compares the distinct storytelling and social commentary of "Battle Royale" with that of "Squid Game," emphasizing how both works reflect on human nature and societal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a much stronger connection between Battle Royale and Hunger Games, than Squid Game. Very similar government depiction, the announcement of deaths etc. Moreover, we should appreciate Battle Royale even more - because it was done waaay before any prior art existed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a little odd to me how much media attention these shows are getting, yet how little debt, more specifically usurious interest rates that lead to inescapable debt, as a general factor of modern life is discussed.I suppose most of the contestants in the shows are in debt because of gambling or overtly irresponsible decisions, but it would be more interesting IMO if the contestants were in debt from student loans, credit cards with 25% interest rates, medical debt, and so on. But I guess a show making that particular social critique isn’t going to get funded by a major studio or tech company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And before Battle Royale, there was Kaiji.It's identical. People with debt invited to a game and a chance at loads of cash. People die in the game and some get enslaved. Rich people sit in another room and laugh while they watch people suffer. There's even a game where the "contestants" walk high up and fall to their deaths.Then the main character gets called back into the game and you get a season 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652967</guid></item><item><title>5.

A few things are written in C such as the display driver, but otherwise most things are in micropython. We chose the T-Watch 2020 V3 microphone variant as the platform [2].Our objective is to build a modern PDA device via a mostly stand-alone watch that can be synced across devices (initially the Linux desktop).

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a scorecard evaluating the predictions made by Rodney Brooks regarding technological advancements and societal changes anticipated for the year 2025. Brooks reflects on various predictions, assessing their accuracy based on the current state of technology and societal trends as of January 2023. Key areas of focus include robotics, AI, and automation, with a mix of successful and inaccurate forecasts. The evaluation serves to illustrate the unpredictability of technological progress and its implications on the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels too self-congratulatory when he claims to be correct about self driving in the Waymo case. The bar he set is so broad and ambiguous, that probably anything Waymo did, would not qualify as self driving to him. So he think humans are intervening once every 1-2 miles to train the Waymo, we’re not even sure if that is true, I heard from friends that it was 100+ miles but let us say Waymo comes out and says it is 1000 miles.Then I bet Rodney can just fiddle with goal post and say that 3.26 trillion miles were driven in US in 2024, and having a human intervene 1000 miles would mean 3.26 billion interventions, and that this is clearly not self driving. In fact until Waymo disables Internet on all cars and prices it never needs any intervention ever, Rodney can claim he’s right, even then maybe not stopping exactly where Rodney wanted it to, might be proof that self driving doesn’t work.Next big thing after deep learning prediction is clearly false. LLM is deep learning, scaled up, we are not in any sense looking past deep learning. Rodney I bet wanted it to be symbolic AI, but that is most likely a dead end, and the bitter lesson actually holds. In fact we have been riding this deep learning wave since Alex-Net 2012. OpenAI talked about scaling since 2016 and during that time the naysayers could be very confident and claim we needed something more, but OpenAI went ahead and proved out the scaling hypothesis and passed the language Turing test. We haven’t needed anything more except scale and reasoning has also turned out to be similar. Just an LLM trained to reason, no symbolic merger, not even a search step it seems like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That being said, we are not on the verge of replacing and eliminating humans in either white collar jobs or blue collar jobs.Tell that to someone laid off when replaced by some "AI" system.&gt; Waymo not autonomous enoughIt's not clear how often Waymo cars need remote attention, but it's not every 1-2 miles. Customers would notice the vehicle being stopped and stuck during the wait for customer service. There are many videos of people driving in Waymos for hours without any sign of a situation that required remote intervention.Tesla and Baidu do use remote drivers.The situations where Waymo cars get stuck are now somewhat obscure cases. Yesterday, the new mayor of SF had two limos double-parked, and a Waymo got stuck behind that. A Waymo got stuck in a parade that hadn't been listed on Muni's street closure list.&gt; Flying carsProbably at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. They won't be cost-effective, but it will be a cool demo.
EHang recently put solid state batteries into their flying car and got 48 minutes of flight time, instead of their previous 25 minutes. Ehang is basically a scaled-up quadrotor drone, with 16 motors and props. EHang been flying for years, but not for very long per recharge. Better batteries will help a lot.[1] https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/electric-air-taxi-flights-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good example of everything that can wrong with a prediction market if left unchecked. Don't like that Waymo broke your prediction? Fine just move your goalposts. Like that prediction came true but on the wrong timeframe? Just move the goal posts.Glad Polymarket (and other related markets) exist so they can put actual goal posts in place with mechanisms that require certain outcomes in order to finalize on a prediction result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651275</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading some of these books recommended here, perhaps the most shocking thing is that so much is due to randomness: an arbitrary person does something small that turns out to be on the critical path, and without it the big thing would not get completed.I like the kind of books recommended here, but please be aware of survivor's bias (there not many books about failures! Any great recommendations? "How we could NOT get back to the moon again", "Recall: Toyota hits the breaks", "Last fag: how big tobacco lost against a Minneapolis law firm" ;-) and the fact that the winner gets to write the history. For example, next month, Bill Gates new memoir "Source Code" will come out, the first of three planned autobiographical books, and I doubt he will share with us how he strongarmed PC manufacturers into shipping Windows pre-installed in order to get the OS monopoly and other important events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very much a shameless plug but I wrote a book, Rebooting a Nation, on how the country of Estonia was able to modernize post re-independence in the early '90s and become a leader in e-government (99% of government services accessible online) and a tech hub (Skype, Transferwise, Bolt, etc.). I tried to draw out practical lessons for policymakers in other countries, especially in the U.S. as I wrote it after having worked for the Estonian government and advised some members of Congress in DC on tech policy. It's available for pre-order now and comes out in a few months, link below.https://www.rebootinganation.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Box by Marc Levinson is the incredible story of the dawn of containerized shipping.It is a little shocking just how recently this happened (the very first experimental loads were in the 1950s), and that the standard of shipping before containers was for longshoremen to literally hand carry boxes of stuff onto ships and stuff them just anywhere. You would be stunned to realize just how new and unused the piers of San Francisco really are, because they were built with massive government subsidies at exactly the wrong time.The book covers the courageous people involved, the political and economic impacts, and how the industry truly found its footing prioritizing absolutely reducing operational costs over all other concerns (like delivery speed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42614722</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Metrics for the Evaluations of the Sequence of Decoding" presents a comprehensive examination of different metrics used to evaluate the performance of sequence decoding methods in various contexts such as language processing and machine learning. It critiques standard metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, discussing their limitations and proposing alternative approaches for more reliable and effective evaluations. The research emphasizes the importance of assessing decoding quality through both qualitative and quantitative measurements to improve model performance in generating accurate and contextually relevant sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find their critique compelling, particularly their emphasis on the disconnect between CoT’s algorithmic mimicry and true cognitive exploration. The authors illustrate this with examples from advanced mathematics, such as the "windmill problem" from the International Mathematics Olympiad, a puzzle whose solution eludes brute-force sequential thinking. These cases underscore the limits of a framework that relies on static datasets and rigid generative processes. CoT, as they demonstrate, falters not because it cannot generate solutions, but because it cannot conceive of them in ways that mirror human ingenuity.As they say - "Superintelligence isn't about discovering new things; it's about discovering new ways to discover."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; That is, language
 models learn the implicit meaning in text, as opposed to the early belief some researchers held that
 sequence-to-sequence models (including transformers) simply fit correlations between sequential
words.Is this so, that the research community is agreed?  Are there papers discussing this topic?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; Behind this approach is a simple principle often abbreviated as "compression is intelligence", or the model must approximate the distribution of data and perform implicit reasoning in its activations in order to predict the next token (see Solomonoff Induction; Solomonoff 1964)For the record, the word "intelligence" appears in the two parts of "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference" (referenced above) a total of 0 times. The word "Compression" appears a total of 0 times. The word "reasoning" once; in the phrase "using similar reasoning".Unsurprisingly, Solomonoff's work was preoccupied with Inductive Inference. I don't know that he ever said anything bout "compression is intelligence" but I believe this is an idea, and a slogan, that was developed only much later. I am not sure where it comes from, originally.It is correct that Solomonoff induction was very much about predicting the next symbol in a sequence of symbols; not necessarily linguistic tokens, either. The common claim that LLMs are "in their infancy" or similar are dead wrong. Language modelling is basically ancient (in CS terms) and we have long since crossed in the era of its technological maturity._______________[1] https://raysolomonoff.com/publications/1964pt1.pdf[2] https://raysolomonoff.com/publications/1964pt2.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655098</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of formal wear, specifically focusing on its significance and evolution in modern society. It outlines various types of formal attire for different occasions, including black tie, white tie, and cocktail attire, while emphasizing the importance of understanding dress codes to make appropriate choices. Additionally, the piece offers tips for selecting and styling formal outfits, highlighting factors such as fabric, fit, and accessories to enhance one’s overall appearance for events.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formal verification of software, as the article acknowledges, relies heavily on the type of software and the development process.To use formal verification you need to have formal requirements of the behavior of your software. Most software projects and design philosophies are simply incompatible with this.In software development and design can often fall together, but that means that it is uniquely ill suited for formal methods. If you are developing, before you are sure what you even want, then formal methods do not apply.But I agree that there are certain areas, mostly smaller, safety critical, systems, which rely on upfront specifications, which can heavily benefit from formal verification. E.g. Aerospace software relies heavily on verification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see this line of reasoning about formal methods a lot: software is big and complicated and hard to get right... therefore formal methods.On the one hand, I _want_ this to be true both for selfish and practical reasons: selfishly because I'm very very good at learning things that require an academic learning approach (read a book, work some exercises, practice) and if something I'm good at is important, that means more money for me.  Practically because they're right, software _is_ big and complicated and hard to get right and as a practitioner, it's really frustrating when it does fail and I'm scrambling to figure out why.On the other hand, though, nobody ever seems to make a compelling case for how formal methods proposes to solve that problem.  This author actually does better than most by pointing out how most modern "design" is a waste of time but doesn't really go into why TLA, say, is better than (demonstrably mostly useless) UML.  There's sort of an implied suggestion that if you dedicate a few months (or years?) to learning TLA, you'll reach enlightenment and understand how it's helpful in a way that's impossible to articulate to the unenlightened.  And that's not impossible to imagine!  Calculus and Bayesian statistics are kind of like that; you need to really understand them before you can really see why they're useful.I always find myself left applying what I call "project manager" logic - I need to make a snap decision right now about whether or not I should invest time in this "formal method" stuff or not so I have to be observational: if it was really that helpful, more people would be applying it and the benefits would speak for themselves.  They've been around a long, long time, though, and never caught on - it's hard not to conclude that there's probably a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lightweight formal methods callout is a good one. Maintaining a suite of proptest[1] strategies alongside the codebase is not a very much larger investment than writing unit tests by hand, but the insights they provide due to extensive coverage and compact understandable failure cases are way better. And crucially this approach does align with normal software development practices.[1] https://crates.io/crates/proptest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656433</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would love to see a pterosaur / bat version of this drone. Birds use one set of muscles to jump in the air and another to flap their wings, limiting how big they can get.  That’s because, if you make your wing muscles bigger, then you need bigger leg muscles to support them, then you need bigger wing muscles to support your legs, etc.  pterosaurs and bats have tiny little legs and use their “arm” (wing) muscles to do the initial jump into the air. It’s just one set of muscles that are used for both functions, which is why pterosaurs were able to get so big. It does beg the question, tho, why we haven’t seen any truly giant bats.This pbs aeons video has a great explanation: https://youtu.be/scAp-fncp64?si=hjeWKGBI7riyjE1M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The initial GIF is a bit lackluster, as it looks like it’s just walking around dragging a tail. The full video posted later in the article is much more impressive.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8DJ1a3sLIcThe article itself is worth a read too imo, I found the bits about toes for easier balance and jumping to takeoff energy efficiency interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth pointing out that EPFL's PR release includes a picture of Won Dong Shin (the PhD that actually built it) as opposed to a picture of the lab's director as it sometimes happens in academia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42617825</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and complexities encountered while implementing OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework for cloud-native software. The author shares their personal experience, highlighting issues such as intricate setup processes, difficulties in configuration, and a steep learning curve associated with the various tools and components involved. The piece ultimately emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of OpenTelemetry to effectively leverage its capabilities for monitoring and improving application performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole time I was learning/porting to Otel I felt like I was back in the Java world again. Every time I stepped through the code it felt like EnterpriseFizzBuzz. No discoverability. At all. And their own jargon that looks like it was made by people high on something.And in NodeJS, about four times the CPU usage of StatsD. We ended up doing our own aggregation to tamp this down and to reduce tag proliferation (StatsD is fine having multiple processes reporting the same tags, OTEL clobbers). At peak load we had 1 CPU running at 60-80% utilization. Until something changes we couldn’t vertically scale. Other factors on that project mean that’s now unlikely to happen but it grates.OTEL is actively hostile to any language that uses one process per core. What a joke.Just go with Prometheus. It’s not like there are other contenders out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/anacrolix/notel?tab=readme-ov-file#what-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Otel seems complicated because different observability vendors make implementing observability super easy with their proprietary SDK’s, agents and API’s. This is what Otel wants to solve and I think the people behind it are doing a great job.
Also kudos to grafana for adopting OpenTelemetry as a first class citizen of their ecosystem.I’ve been pushing the use of Datadog for years but their pricing is out of control for anyone between mid size company and large enterprises. So as years passed and OpenTelemetry API’s and SDK’s stabilized it became our standard for application observability.To be honest the documentation could be better overall and the onboarding docs differ per programming language, which is not ideal.My current team is on a NodeJS/Typescript stack and we’ve created a set of packages and an example Grafana stack to get started with OpenTelemetry real quick.
Maybe it’s useful to anyone here: https://github.com/zonneplan/open-telemetry-js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655102</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and release of the game "Bubble Bobble" for the Commodore 64 by the programmer Geon. It outlines the challenges faced during the game's creation, including technical limitations and gameplay design decisions. The post also shares insights into the game's mechanics, graphics, and music, as well as the nostalgic appeal of bringing a classic arcade experience to the C64 platform. Additionally, it highlights the efforts made to capture the essence of the original game while adapting it for home computer gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

I can sit down almost anyone on the couch and they'll enjoy at least a few rounds, experienced video game players or not.That the game design and implementation cuts through FOUR decades of time to be enjoyable says something. There are many old games which still are good but not as accessible to a modern audience.There are even more old games which are impressive even in retrospect, but don't play well today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice analysis, and cool to see how simple it is to get quite a satisfying effect. Also quite fun to see that the level symmetry was indeed exploited multiple ways to save space. If the author is here, they write '"@123" are the first 4 entries in the default c64 character set' but likely meant @ABC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 1998, a level editor was made for the Arcade version of Bubble Bobble, named "Patch-A-Bobble".  This level editor revealed the directional airflow in the levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611077</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always find that sharing those little tedious details is what creates visceral understanding of a situation. In this case, the true horror of being a liberated Black person in the 1800s and having to relentlessly work to rescue others, while surrounded by people who truly don't care.On a lighter note, I use the same approach in understanding user needs as a product builder. I focus on letting people share the minutiae of their day rather than have them editorialize the big topics. By doing so, I get a lot of visceral insight and intuition.Thanks for sharing this. I really enjoyed reading it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a great example for the point that the author is trying to make. The fact that after all that effort, Ruggles was only able to free 2 out of 5 enslaved men is apropos. His victory was incomplete, incremental at best, and nearly got him enslaved again as well, but it was still a victory and it counted, especially for the two men that did get their freedom.Shout-out to a grindset abolitionist!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Finally, on Christmas Eve, a group of armed black New Yorkers (reportedly not including Ruggles) boarded the brig Brilliante and managed to rescue two of the men.This sentence kind of contradicts the author's point though? After all that tedious work within the legal system it wasn't even procedure that got any of these men freed, but actual direct action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655636</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;MacBASIC is a version of the BASIC programming language developed for the Macintosh computer. It was one of the early programming environments for Mac, allowing users to create software using a simple and accessible interface. The article discusses its features, such as its integrated development environment, syntax, and the ability to manipulate the Macintosh's graphical capabilities. It also highlights the historical context of MacBASIC within the evolution of Apple software and its impact on programming practices for the Macintosh platform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andy Hertzfeld shared the background on why MacBASIC didn't ship with the Mac.&gt; Apple's original deal with Microsoft for licensing Applesoft Basic had a term of eight years, and it was due to expire in September 1985. Apple still depended on the Apple II for the lion's share of its revenues, and it would be difficult to replace Microsoft Basic without fragmenting the software base. Bill Gates had Apple in a tight squeeze, and, in an early display of his ruthless business acumen, he exploited it to the hilt. He knew that Donn's Basic was way ahead of Microsoft's, so, as a condition for agreeing to renew Applesoft, he demanded that Apple abandon MacBasic, buying it from Apple for the price of $1, and then burying it.https://folklore.org/MacBasic.htmlIt was a shame, since MacBASIC allowed users to write software that supported the features of the Mac UI and Microsoft's BASIC did not.&gt; Benchmarks published in Washington Apple Pi Journal suggested that MacBASIC had better performance as compared to Microsoft's MS BASIC for Macintosh. The language included modern looping control structures, user-defined functions, graphics, and access to the Macintosh Toolbox. The development environment supported multiple programs running simultaneously with symbolic debugging including breakpoints and single-step execution.https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBASICHowever, the late betas were out in the wild with no copy protection, so it was passed around by user groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a 128K Mac owner who bought Microsoft's BASIC for the Mac, this still makes me angry.Then Apple released HyperCard and that was nice, until they dropped it.Then Runtime Revolution was released, and I found it quite nice to use, then they opensourced it as Livecode and I pledged for that, then they quit supporting the Community Edition and closed the code again (anyone know if anyone is making progress on getting this to compile/work/install?).These days I just use Python, but I'd really like to see a nice option for GUI development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because of this posting, I found the "1.0" version at Macintosh Garden and started playing with it in an emulator. It is pretty neat and advanced for the time -- while it supports the traditional line number/goto/gosub style of BASIC, you can also not use line numbers and define multi-line functions with "function/end function" and basically have something as structured as Pascal. Obviously this style of BASIC was common in the 1990s with Visual Basic and the like, but for 1984 this was unusual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612085</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nature of formalized mathematics and its accessibility to both mathematicians and non-mathematicians. It explores a specific proof in mathematical logic, highlighting how the complexity of formalism can create barriers to understanding. The author, Stephen Wolfram, argues for the importance of intuitively grasping mathematical concepts beyond formal proofs and emphasizes the need for effective communication in mathematics to bridge the gap between expert understanding and broader comprehension. The piece ultimately advocates for making sophisticated mathematical ideas more approachable to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the perennial questions about proof automation has been the utility of proofs that cannot be understood by humans.Generally, most computer scientists using proof automation don't care about the proof itself -- they care that one exists. It can contain as many lemmas and steps as needed. They're unlikely to ever read it.It seems to me that LLMs would be decent at generating proofs this way: so long as they submit their tactics to the proof checker and the proof is found they can generate whatever is needed.However for mathematicians, of which I am not a member of that distinguished group, seem to appreciate qualities in proofs such as elegance and simplicity. Many mathematicians that I've heard respond to the initial question believe that a proof generated by some future AI system will not be useful to humans if they cannot understand and appreciate it. The existence of a proof is not enough.Now that we're getting close to having algorithms that can generate proofs it makes the question a bit more urgent, I think. What use is a proof that isn't elegant? Are proofs written for a particular audience or are they written for the result?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting how sometimes it feels like a topic starts showing up super often all of the sudden. It probably isn't a coincidence, since my interest and probably this post's interest is due to Tao's recent equation challenge https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/ .I was surprised and intrigued to find Wolfram's name when I was reading background literature doing this blog post https://www.philipzucker.com/cody_sheffer/ where I translated my friend's Lean proof of the correspondence of Sheffer stroke to Boolean algebra in my python proof assistant knuckledragger https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger (an easier result than Wolfram's single axiom one).I was also intrigued reading about the equational theorem prover Waldmeister https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/s... that it may have been acquired by Mathematica? It's hard to know how Mathematica's equational reasoning system is powered behind the scenes.Mathematica can really make for some stunning visuals. Quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although Wolfram doesn't mention it by name, this is closely related to what he is trying to do: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42654995</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the game Cuttle, a two-player combat game typically played on a 5x5 grid. Each player controls a set of pieces, using tactics to capture the opponent's pieces through strategic movement and placement. The article explains the rules in detail, including how pieces can move and capture, as well as variations of the game to enhance play. It aims to guide new players in understanding the gameplay and to offer insights for more experienced players seeking to improve their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a huge fan of card games that can be played with a regular deck of cards, and I play Cuttle with my kids somewhat regularly. It's a fast-paced game, but you do have to get over the initial learning curve of the effects. I find just printing out a piece of paper with a quick reference on it helps.As others have alluded to in the thread, teaching people the rules is a barrier. As I looked around for a professionally printed game, I found a game that was very much like Magic the Gathering, but also just a single box of cards called Mindbug.https://mindbug.me/Turns out it was designed by some folks that brought Richard Garfield in near the end of its design and he ended up having some say in the final product. I've played it a couple of times and each game is only played with a random subset of the cards, so the combinatorics create a lot of replay value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone who wants a more complex game proximate to this design, there's a small production called Reinforcements (https://reinforcementscg.myshopify.com/). Non-collectible, single box.You play a hand of up to 5 cards each turn: Adding cards to (concealed) stacked ranks of defending troops, attacking an opponent's ranks, using a card's ability. The suits have different defensive properties when arranged in a rank, and combine in interesting ways; there are also "ultimate" powers players can grab from the center by forming their ranks with particular arrangements of suits, which act as turtle-busters.Highly recommended, quite fun, probably plays best 1v1. Definitely a lot of small rules to absorb, so it's a more complex beast. But nowhere close to the complexity of Magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are the notes I wrote for myself as a magic player, to translate it into purely MTG terms. (These probably aren't enough to explain on their own, but they'll probably help MTG players who want to get the gist.)Your opponent has 21 life and you win when your creatures have at least that much power. You can’t attack.Setup: dealer goes second and starts with 6 cards, opponent starts with 5 cards. Hand limit of 7.On your turn:
Either play 1 card or draw 1 cardPoint cards (ace - 10; ace is 1) are creatures with power equal to their point number. 
Face cards (and sideways 8) are enchantments.
No lands or mana costs. 
"Playing" a card refers to casting that card or channeling that card.Every point card has “channel -  discard this card: Choose a creature with lesser value. Destroy it.” (suit matters, spades &gt; hearts &gt; diamonds &gt; clubs, e.g., 8 of hearts is greater value than 8 of diamonds or any 7 but less than 8 of spades or any 9.) Note that this doesn't target.Most point cards can be played as sorceries for an alternate effect:Ace: wrath of God2: disenchant OR muddle the mixture (this is the only instant and does not count toward your 1 card per turn limit. Everything else is sorcery speed)3: regrowth4: mind rot5: divination6: tranquility / back to nature7: mind’s desire8: sideways as enchantment - glasses of Urza9: aura extraction*10: noneFace cards are exclusively enchantments:Jack: control magic**Queen: Privileged position***King: reduce your opponent’s life total based on the number of kings you control for as long as they remain on the battlefield: 0: 21; 1: 14; 2: 10; 3: 7; 4: 5.Notes: The card types are pretty explicit - muddle the mixture can only counter sorceries or instants, not creatures, enchantments, or channeling. Wrath of god only kills creatures, tranquility only kills enchantments.Rules can differ, depending on the source:* sometimes as "reflector mage for enchantments", sometimes as "unsummon for enchantments".
**sometimes as "exchange control of target creature". 
***sometimes as "all permanents you control have hexproof", I.e., including itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42658614</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Finland's successful strategy to achieve zero homelessness, which focuses on providing permanent housing solutions as a foundational approach. Key components of this strategy include the Housing First model, which prioritizes immediate housing for the homeless without preconditions, and comprehensive support services that address the underlying issues contributing to homelessness, such as mental health and substance abuse. The Finnish government’s commitment, effective use of resources, and collaboration with non-profit organizations are also highlighted as critical factors in reducing homelessness. The article emphasizes the importance of this model as a potential blueprint for other countries facing similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656711"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also do a lot of compulsory psychiatric detention: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychiatric-bulletin...&gt; Finnish mental health legislation takes a medical approach to compulsory measures, emphasising the need for treatment of psychiatric patients over civil liberties concerns... Finland has the highest rates of detention per 100 000 inhabitants, about 214 compared with 93 in the UK and 11 in Italy.&gt; If at the end of the 3-month period it is considered likely that detention criteria are still fulfilled, new recommendations MII and MIII are filed and the renewed detention is then valid for 6 months. However, this second period of detention has to be immediately confirmed by a local administrative court.edit: I should mention that I've seen fairly convincing cross-sectional evidence that homelessness is more related to the housing market than mental illness: https://www.ucpress.edu/books/homelessness-is-a-housing-prob... ,  https://www.nahro.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NAHRO-Summi...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This issue is very relevant for me since I have been homeless since May. It's been a bad run of being a target of criminal activity, unemployment and just running out of money during my job search. I cope with a mix of volunteering, overpriced housing (think $1200/month for a room in a rural area before I ran out of money for that), catsitting, house-sitting, staying with family and sleeping in my ancient car. Although I'm a citizen I don't qualify for any government support or programs, even though we have employment insurance here which I paid into for years.I'm from Ottawa where the cold is obviously deadly, as it is in Finland. I do feel that we need to take shelter more seriously in public policy compared to warm areas because of that. Last week someone froze to death overnight a few blocks away from where I was crashing on a couch with family. Walking through downtown Ottawa and seeing the huge empty, lit, warm buildings with people freezing to death right outside is striking. Any practically minded person can see the problem is political and philosophical, not practical.I can tell all the posters who think people choose to be homeless that I'm certainly not one of them. The comments about the importance of avoiding a downward spiral are certainly correct. Searching for work is hard enough normally and becomes increasingly difficult without access to things like a kitchen and toilet.What I see in this Finnish policy is the starting assumption that doing nothing is not a good option. After reaching that point there can a rational discussion about what to do with whatever money is being spent - do you pay more people to hand out blankets and conduct surveys or just use it to buy housing units? As a homeless person I would really like to see Canada have a policy like I'm reading in this article instead of what we are doing now. The crappy temporary shelters and bureaucratic spending strategy obviously isn't working.Even just economically, to have a government pay for years of schooling and subsidize advanced degrees then just be ready to let that person die on the street when they are ready to work but can't happen to find something seems like a waste. I'd rather see a functioning "social safety net" as described in this article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without digging too deep into the nature of the statistics they use, I'm a little skeptical of this.The transition to using the word "homeless" has resulted in transforming something we can't easily measure -- "drug addicted or mentally ill people being a public menace" -- into something that we can measure -- "people without a good living arrangement".Sure, the latter is important in a lot of ways too. And there housing is a tolerable solution.But the former is the actual problem that we care about. It's nearly impossible to measure. It's nearly impossible to fix. The horrors of involuntary commitment vs. the horrors of not having involuntary commitment vs. the horrors of using the criminal justice system vs. the horrors of not using the criminal justice system.The fact is that we have no real model for treatment of severely mentally ill people. We have a number of effective drugs, but they rapidly become ineffective if not taken. Our ability to treat or "cure" people in these conditions is essentially non-existent.The question I would ask of Finland before considering this data or analysis to be interesting is what is their state of involuntary indefinite commitment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656711</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation of Vade Studio, a platform built using Clojure, emphasizing the challenges and motivations behind the project. It highlights the belief in tackling difficult problems as a way to foster growth and innovation, and details the team's commitment to utilizing Clojure for its functional programming capabilities, simplicity, and robust ecosystem.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clojure is a lot of fun to tinker with, but man… I love my static types. I think I’d hate to work on a large codebase in Clojure and constantly be wondering what exactly “m” is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting story.  I am not entirely convinced that all credit should go to the programming language here, though.My theory is that communicating abstractions is hard.  If you work on your own, or in a (very) small team, you can come up with powerful abstractions that allow you to build amazing systems, quickly.  However, sharing the underlying ideas and philosophy with new team members can be daunting.  As systems grow, and mistakes are made, it becomes more and more likely that you run into serious problems.This may also be why Java and similar object oriented programming languages are so successful for systems that have to be maintained for ages, by large teams of developers.  There are but few abstractions and patterns, and it does not allow you to shoot yourself in the foot, nor to blow your whole leg off.  Conversely, this may also be why complex frameworks, such as Spring, are not always so nice, because they introduce (too?) powerful abstractions, for example through annotations.  It may also clarify why more powerful languages such as Scala, Common Lisp, Smalltalk, Haskell, etc, consistently fail to pick up steam.Another theory is that not every developer is comfortable with abstract concepts, and that it simply takes a team of smart people to handle those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious if Elixir could provide a similar development environment?Seems like many similar capabilities, like a focus on immutable data structures, pure functions, being able to patch and update running systems without a restart, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42622264</guid></item><item><title>20.

Seeing our acquisition by Datadog on the HN front page feels like a truly full-circle moment.HN has been interwoven with Quickwit's journey from the very beginning. Looking back, it's striking to see how our progress is literally chronicled in our HN front-page posts:- Searching the web for under $1000/month [0]- A Rust optimization story [1]- Decentralized cluster membership in Rust [2]- Filtering a vector with SIMD instructions (AVX-2 and AVX-512) [3]- Efficient indexing with Quickwit Rust actor framework [4]- A compressed indexable bitset [5]- Show HN: Quickwit – OSS Alternative to Elasticsearch, Splunk, Datadog [6]- Quickwit 0.8: Indexing and Search at Petabyte Scale [7]- Tantivy – full-text search engine library inspired by Apache Lucene [8]- Binance built a 100PB log service with Quickwit [9]- Datadog acquires Quickwit [10]Each of these front-page appearances was a milestone for us. We put our hearts into writing those engineering articles, hoping to contribute something valuable to our community.I'm convinced HN played a key role in Quickwit's success by providing visibility, positive feedback, critical comments, and leads that contacted us directly after a front-page post. This community's authenticity and passion for technology are unparalleled.

It has been pretty nice and stable in my experience, so I can't really complain much. But I was really looking forward to what else it could bring.Congrats to the team, in any case!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The clock begins counting down to Datadog figuring out how to charge per node, cpu, container, RAM (KB), and unicode characters indexed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42648043</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the design and implementation of tracing in PyPy, a Python interpreter that focuses on performance optimization. It explores the concept of "tracing" as a method to enhance execution speed by dynamically profiling Python code and generating specialized machine code. The author reflects on the challenges and philosophy behind tracing, including considerations of how to efficiently manage resources and the impact of tracing on programming paradigms. Overall, it provides insights into the technical intricacies and thought processes involved in developing a high-performance interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't always get astounding performance, but it very often does, and you get all the inlining and dynamic specialization goodness that tracing JITs make cheap.  And it demonstrates extremely convincingly that PyPy's difficulty with invoking native code isn't essential to tracing JIT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article. I'd like to also know PyPy developers thoughts on the copy-and-patch approach chosen to implement the new JIT under development for CPython.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42610091</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses images captured by the M-CAM instrument on the BepiColombo spacecraft, which reveal the shadowy northern polar region of Mercury. These observations provide insights into the planet's surface composition and geological features, highlighting areas that may contain water ice and other volatiles. The findings enhance our understanding of Mercury's environment and its potential for future studies related to planetary formation and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ESA's article claims to "reveal" Mercury's shadowy north pole, yet the image provides no actual insight into the pole itself, which remains shrouded in permanent darkness... The term "revealed" feels more like marketing spin than substance, as the image merely captures the general area around the pole.This framing is reminiscent of similar oversights in planetary science, such as the perplexing case of Mars' north pole. Studies suggest a cyclical process where subsurface vapor escapes through a thinned crust during colder seasons, freezing into massive ice deposits, like those seen in the Korolev Crater. These ice layers, some over 1.2 miles thick (see the ESA Korolev Crater Study), challenge the traditional narrative of Mars' geophysical activity. Observations from missions like Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal hints of dynamic interactions between the crust and atmosphere, yet much of this is glossed over in mainstream discussions.Why is there a persistent pattern of incomplete or opaque presentations regarding planetary poles? The public deserves transparency and detailed interpretations, not handwaving claims. If the evidence of crustal thinning and volatile release is as compelling as the imagery suggests, why the reluctance to address it head-on???A commitment to clarity would foster trust in scientific institutions, rather than leaving informed observers to speculate about what's being left unsaid. This is frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With labels describing the surface features: https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/Mercury_s_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely love the ESA Like button in the article.

This forces the ligatures to always take up the same space as two (or however many glyphs) are involved, which may stretch the ligature glyph in a non-intended way (if it is even possible to rasterise it that way).Monospace fonts are also often used for programming (because they make sure that the columns line up consistently, regardless of the font being used). I personally don't see the point in showing ligature glyphs that do not correspond to the actual Unicode code points encoded to bytes in the source code.Just my 2 cents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the ligature from MonoLisa is a good example of how not to do ligatures. I can't tell whether it stands for "#={" or "#{". Ligatures can be nice, to each their own, but only if they don't introduce ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why should code have to be in a monospace font?I've read and written all my code and that of others in proportional fonts for at least 15 years.Of course there are coding styles that look better in a monospace font, e.g. if you use column alignment instead of simple indentation.But even those are nearly as readable in a proportional font.So things don't line up perfectly? Big deal.As a specific example, any Python code formatted with Black will be equally readable in a proportional font or a monospace font.This is because Black forgoes column alignment tricks and uses simple indentation for everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650501</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advanced topics in C programming, specifically focusing on manipulating and utilizing the `void*` type in innovative ways. It explains how to leverage type-generic pointers for flexibility in data handling and includes examples of creative solutions, like implementing a type-safe variant for functions. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding memory management and the implications of using pointers to enhance code efficiency and maintainability. Overall, it encourages programmers to explore unconventional programming techniques in C while maintaining clarity and safety in their code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expect many people know this one, but it's a useful teaching aid when understanding the relationship between arrays and pointers  int array[10];
  *(array+1) = 56;
  array[2] = 4;
  3[array] = 27;

The first two are obvious, but the third is also legal.  It works because array indexing is just sugar for pointer arithmetic, so array[2]=4 is identical in meaning to *(array+2)=4.  Therefore 3[array]=27 is identical to *(3+array)=27 and so is legal.  But just because you can doesn't mean you should.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to speculate a bit on why these silly things are in C.C was developed on a PDP-11 that had 64Kb of memory. That's not much of any at all. Therefore, the compiler must be extremely tightly coded.The fundamental rules of the C language are pretty simple. But articles like these expose consequences of such simple rules. Fixing them requires adding more code. Adding more code means less room for the code being compiled.Therefore, if the intended use of the language works, the pragmatic approach would be to simply not worry about the quirky consequences.A more interesting question would be "why do these characteristics persist in modern C compilers?"The stock answer is "backwards compatibility", "Obfuscated C Code contests" and "gotcha job interview questions". My argument would be that there is no reason for the persistence of such "junk DNA" and it should be deprecated and removed.I've done my part. D doesn't support that stuff, even though the basic use of the language is easily confused with C.For example:    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    void main()
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i);
            printf("%d\n", i);
    }

I've died on that hill. I know others who lost an entire day staring at it wondering what's wrong with it. I saw it on X recently as "99% of C programmers will not be able to find the bug."The equivalent D code:    import core.stdc.stdio;
    void main()
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i);
            printf("%d\n", i);
    }

gets you:    test.d(5): Error: use `{ }` for an empty statement, not `;`

C'mon, Standard C! Fix that!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had read the GCC documentation and I did not know about the forward parameter declaration. I did know about the other stuff that is mentioned there (and in the first part).Declarations in for loops is something that I had only ever used in macros (I had not found it useful in other circumstances), such as:  #define lpt_document() for(int lpt_document_=lpt_begin();lpt_document_;lpt_document_=(lpt_end(),0))
  #define win_form(xxx) for(win_memo win_mem=win_begin_();;win_step_(&amp;win_mem,xxx))

(The compiler will optimize out the loop and the declared variable in the use of the lpt_document macro; I had tested this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657591</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "flattening" in the context of software design, particularly focusing on how reducing complexity in code structures can lead to clearer and more maintainable software. It emphasizes the benefits of flattening nested structures or unnecessarily convoluted designs, which can often hinder understanding and increase the potential for errors. The author provides examples and explains various scenarios where flattening can improve readability and streamline functionality in programming. Overall, the piece advocates for simplicity and clarity in software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Instead of allocating Expr objects willy-nilly on the heap, we’ll pack them into a single, contiguous array."
Zig compiler pipeline (AST, Zir, Air, Sema) does exactly this on all layers. Not only contiguous, but instead of array-of-structs it is struct-of-arrays, so walking the tree is even more cache friendly. For AST see: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/zig/Ast.z...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought a reddit comment on this article had an interesting point:https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1d3b356/my_new_favori...[–]Timzhy0 3 points 7 months agoBtw I think one can go a step further than the author, there is no need to keep two explicit ExprRef baked in a binary node (lhs, rhs). You can exploit locality, basically the AST, seen it the LISP way, is just an arbitrarily nestable list, where elements are atoms or other lists. Hence all you need to know is where each list ends (and if it's an atom you can assume it spans one node) and actually one bit to know if it is the last entry in the list is quite ergonomic as well (because then you can distinguish whether moving next slot in the AST means there is a sibling). Basically it's easier to keep it sync while constructing and takes up less memory per node. I pay 40 bits per node, stored interleaved for best cache locality (some unaligned accesses but I think it's still worthwhile), 8 bits for the tag, 32 for the data, if data is bigger, 32 is an index into some auxiliary segment (basically a ptr).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rediscovering techniques that were somewhat well-known in the 70s and 80s.See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42659061</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "lc" by user gdm85 provides a command-line tool designed for quickly and easily counting lines of code in various programming languages. It supports multiple file extensions and offers options to exclude specific files or directories from the count. The tool is lightweight and aims to streamline the process of analyzing codebases by generating reports of line counts for given project directories. The repository includes installation instructions, usage details, and examples to help users implement the tool effectively in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Gives me that cozy retro feel and fond childhood memories.Beautifying the output sounds like a good idea, perhaps something like this should be an option of standard ls?What strikes me is that the code (which is very idiomatic of C code) is very expressive at the function level, but most of it happens inside the few functions, and the function bodies are much less readable for those who don't write C ls clones all day. The main function is very long because it handles command line switches, that boilerplate could be moved to a function or library.The file lc.1 (UNIX man pasge) is missing, as has already. been pointed out.• simple/compact: single file• small: 446 lines of C code• flat/monolithic: lots of global variables, no separation between functionality and I/O, no separation between command and library API that does the core part of the work.(Just posting what was on my mind, not my intention to attack this fine work!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW, one can download Coherent as a VM:https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/coherent/ftp/vms/Additional Information:https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/coherent/http://www.nesssoftware.com/home/mwc/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the author sees this: please copy/paste the manual in your README instead of including an image with text on it.

So besides not being able to try this app, there is also no way to cancel my automatic payments, which starts on Jan 18.After fixing this onboarding problem, I suggest making it possible to try without giving any personal information. (I expected the video player on the landing page to be functional, but I guess just the note section is.)Also there are many typos on the site. Like "loged in as"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks cool, love work in this direction.

I love the landing page, both the interactive part and particularly the visual style. 
One thing that I would note though, is that scrolling down, I expected the images to be interactive since they blend in with the rest of the page and look like interactive elements. I would either try to make it more obvious that they are example images, or actually make them interactive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42621989</guid></item><item><title>30.

Oops, I moved the scroll wheel button by a notch when pressing it, so it's a mouse cursor now! I fast-forwarded to the second half of the movie and the audio is in French."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “For us, our biggest goal is to create enough value that yes, you would be willing to pay for [Gemini],” Google TV VP and GM Shalini Govil-Pai told the publication.&gt; The executive pointed to future capabilities for the Gemini-driven Google Assistant on TVs, including asking it to “suggest a movie like Jurassic Park but suitable for young children” or to show “Bollywood movies that are similar to Mission: Impossible.”That seems so incredibly useless it reads like parody. No, I will not be willing to pay for Gemini for that.I can’t imagine ever asking questions like those in my life... and even if one day I were drunk, high, and concussed enough to ask, I wouldn’t need to ask my TV—I could just go to claude.ai on my phone instead because I already pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LG keeps missing the obvious: I want in my next TV is a couple more HDMI ports and dumber software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650855</guid></item><item><title>31.

It highlights the potential impact of this service on the continent, where many regions suffer from unreliable and costly internet options.

They just use the cell phone infrastructure for their internet needs via their phones.  I understand this is because cell phone infrastructure is a lot cheaper to roll out and also that there was less desktop computers, etc to plug into ethernet cables.So this article seems to be comparing against something that isn't very popular in the first place - fixed ISPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657692</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a research study focused on the vulnerabilities associated with modern CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in the context of email and browser fingerprinting. It highlights how the complexity of CSS can be exploited to create 'spy sheets' that facilitate tracking users across different platforms. The study presents techniques for leveraging CSS features that are commonly used in web design to clandestinely collect data, thereby illustrating potential privacy concerns. It emphasizes the need for awareness and countermeasures to protect users from such tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

So many things that had just never, and probably would never have, occurred to me to try.It is definitely worth a read (or skim) over the paper to see the lengths they went to in order to figure out some of the unique elements to fingerprint on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this is a privacy nightmare but also kinda... cool? Or at least interesting. I don't think I would have thought of this.1.

I find myself searching for something to make in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652329</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant leak involving the Gravy location data app, which unintentionally exposed sensitive personal information from millions of users. This data, originally collected for advertising purposes, included precise location histories linked to individuals, raising serious privacy concerns. The leak highlights the broader issue of how location data is tracked and shared, often without users' explicit consent, and underscores the need for stricter regulations around data privacy in the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Google forwards info to bidders, who calculate how much they will spend to show you the ad. This means even the losers of the auction get a firehose of data. There are companies set up right now whose purpose is to lose that auction but collect the data anyways.It should not surprise you to learn, then, that In-Q-Tel (the non classified investment arm of the CIA) has invested in some of these analytics (read: digital surveillance) companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One point I do not see addressed in the article is how the location is collected.It'd be a little bit of a stretch to call IP geolocation as collecting location data as it is usually no more accurate than just procuring the geolocation yourself, so there's no need to get it from a broker. However, on an Android for example, both ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION require permission dialogs, so how does it exactly work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    comm -12 &lt;(cat gravy_app_list\ -\ count.csv| uvx --from csvkit csvcut -c 2 | rg '\.' | sort) &lt;(adb shell pm list packages -3 | cut -f 2 -d ":" | sort)

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's quite common in machine learning operations to multiply a matrix of unsigned byte by a matrix of signed byte. Don't ask me why, but that's the case.Overflow is the reason. Intel's vpmaddubsw takes int8_t and uint8_t to give you results in int16_t. If both are unsigned 255 * 255 = 65025 will be out of range for int16_t (−32,768 to +32,767) so likely the instruction is designed to take int8_t and uint8_t. However, if one is signed and other is unsigned extremes -128 * 255 or 127 * 255 are always in int16_t range. The overflow (or rather saturation with this instruction) can still occur because it sums adjacent multiplications. See my comment in PyTorch. https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a37db5ae3978010e1bb7...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious how this compares with, say, the implementation of gemm_s8s8s32 in Intel's MKL / OneAPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656529</guid></item><item><title>37.

Winner promise that and reality was ~250km. There was no chargers installed on terminal loops because it should handle whole day on single charge. That is result of designing system without actual tests and rely only on vendor promises :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This company isn't the only one running autonomous shuttle buses - what makes theirs different from their competitors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many competitors though?

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an in-depth exploration of the concept of time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. It explains how time can pass at different rates depending on relative speeds and gravitational fields, using simple language and mathematical formulas to illustrate these principles. The site includes practical examples and calculations to help readers understand how time dilation affects high-speed travel and is relevant in contexts like GPS technology and astrophysics. Additionally, it highlights the implications of time dilation for both theoretical physics and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author's description of twin paradox is incorrect. In fact, the paradox is not described at all. The paradox is that since motion is relative then from both twin's perspective the other twin goes on a journey and ages slowly. So why it is that on returning, only the traveling twin has aged slowly? The answer is that both twins indeed see each other age slowly but for the traveling twin to come back they have to slow down to zero and reverse direction. At that moment the frame is no longer inertial. While turning around, the traveling twin will see the stationary twin age very quickly (enough to catch up with their earth age), so when they meet there's no paradox. For each of them the other has aged as per their observations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you stop so you don't go whizzing past Alpha Centauri at near light speed? :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woah, thanks for all the comments on this little calculator I built yesterday afternoon.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick the immediate direction that will put you in a position to work with the smartest people. That’s probably more important than picking a technology.Your side projects with agents have impressed people in your org. Do those people impress you? My gut reaction is that if they are impressed by the side projects of a recent college grad, they may not be at the top of that field.At an early stage of your career, the best work environment is one that makes you feel like “damn I’m really going to have to perform to keep up here.” It’s not great to be very early in your career and feel like “damn, I’m the smartest guy in this room.” It can create bad habits and a sense of entitlement.And the tricky thing is, if you are a high performer, most situations will make you feel like the latter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different take here -In my career it hasn't mattered if I'm cleaning bathrooms or building Software used by millions of people IF I'm doing it with people I enjoy being around. The people you work with will make or break your career, and (this will be shocking) if you're smart and like working on hard problems you'll end up wanting to be around people who are like that... so choose your direction based on the people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If space lives up to even a fraction of its potential over the next ~10-20 years then robotics is going to grow astronomically as a field. More generally I have not found software to be a longterm satisfying career - the compensation, freedom, and potential are all excellent. You are well compensated, can work from anywhere*, and a single successful side project (don't sign away your rights to code you write outside of work) always has the possibility to blow up into something worth billions - this is really unlike any other "normal" career. But I think there's a reason that there's a growing sect of people leaving to do everything from farming, woodwork, and even welding. Building even simple things in the real world is somehow so much more satisfying.If I had it to do over again I'd pick a field where software complements something done in the real world - robotics, astronomy, aerospace, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651226</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used kagi for quite a while now, and i use it pretty much exclusively. I was unhappy with google ignoring many terms in my search queries and giving me results that I generally considered to be 'intro' pages and generic content, even when my searches were very specific. I have found kagi much better. I dont use any of the advanced stuff like summarisation or ai stuff, i just want search results that have my keywords in them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brief review of Kagi: I’m never going back to ad-supported search.I rely heavily on internet search for my job, and Kagi has made everything so much faster that I’ve almost stopped thinking about the search engine entirely. Google search had become frustratingly ineffective, often requiring me to dig deep to find what I needed. With Kagi, it just works. I rarely have to scroll beyond the first few results. In fact, Kagi’s effectiveness has made me search even more—now, I use it naturally without considering other services.While this article highlights some valid concerns people may have with Kagi, I think the service is solid enough that everyone should give it a try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kagi is a tough pill to swallow. Their search is hands down the best around, there's no other way around it.That being said, $10/mo is also expensive.The workaround I found is using Kagi Ultimate. I get access to Claude (and I'm still able to attach files + access a dozen other LLMs) for $25/mo, so I was able to cancel Claude and keep Kagi and get the best of both worlds from either product.Side note: incredible that a small team like Kagi's can somehow use LLMs more effectively in search than a company that has years of search experience (i.e. Google)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652125</guid></item><item><title>44.

remained overwhelmingly human—communicating and interacting (23%); coordinating, developing, managing and advising (20%); as well as reasoning and decision-making (18%)—will begin to be automated (30%, 29%, and 27% respectively).WEF 2020, https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-repo...&gt; we estimate that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced by a shift in the division of labour between humans and machines, while 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms.Asymptotic Intelligence is almost here!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run an accelerator out of a huge law firm in Canada. I'm not much involved with the firm outside of using the startup lawyers to get the work done for my founders, but lunch room chatting happens. It's been interesting to hear the discussion: inbound is actually increasing due to AI, AI is both giving bad advice (or more often, good advice badly) and drafting nonsense, or missing so much case law it build weak cases etc. I don't think we will hire less, I don't think we'll downsize, I think we'll just take on work we said no to perviously because it wasn't interesting or whatever, and I think client satisfaction will increase. (also AI tools for huge firm lawyers doing big client files are comically bad, one large legacy player recently turned on the AI feature and it kept telling the lawyers to consult a lawyer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652076</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;A kimchi refrigerator is a specialized appliance designed to store kimchi at optimal conditions, enhancing its fermentation process and flavor while extending its shelf life. These refrigerators typically feature adjustable temperature zones and humidity controls tailored to the needs of kimchi, distinguishing them from standard refrigerators. The design aims to maintain the unique textures and tastes of fermenting foods, often offering separate compartments for different types of kimchi. Kimchi refrigerators are particularly popular in Korean cuisine, reflecting the cultural significance of kimchi in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;And odor. Kimchee taste really does work itself into things in the fridge.I recall a roommate from decades ago (son of Korean immigrants) mention that his parents always kept a small side fridge / mini-fridge for the kimchee, so everything else in the standard fridge wouldn't adopt the flavor -- I think a comment of his was "kimchee flavored butter is not pleasant."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2000 I moved into a shared house in NJ. A few weeks into living there we noticed a growing awful smell coming from the basement. We found that the previous residents had left their kimchi fridge full of kimchi … and had unplugged it before they left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermented foods are a particular interest of mine. I am by no means an expert but I love that we can take very perishable ingredients and make them into other food stuffs using fermentation. Tea, milk, vegetables, bread, etc. can all be fermented and yeast and SCOBY can do so much for us. It’s amazing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42626809</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, what is more common is the likelihood of doing something in the wrong environment (e.g. lab, dev, stage, prod). To help make things a bit more clear, our images now override the PS1 with a `(environment)` at the beginning, which is a different color, lab=green, dev=purple, prod=red. If it saves me once, it was worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I really want is a way to get a read only root shell. I do a lot of work on a "traditional" multi-user unix host, where hundreds of scientists share a powerful computer. I often need to become root to look at files. I want to be able to do that without the ability to screw anything up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why should my user have the right to shut down a production box?Having a tool to warn me that I'm about to do something I shouldn't be allowed to do is okay. Having proper access control would be better.(Fun: 'boulette' is French for 'dumb mistake')&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655708</guid></item><item><title>48.

Your domain does not launch a new "bi" (whatever that is). The .new TLD is managed by Google and they do enforce this requirement.&gt; .new is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it. Help your customers take action faster. Less time clicking means more time creating.You will lose your domain.&gt; While anyone can register, domains that don’t comply with this usage policy may be suspended or deleted by Google Registry without refund.https://www.registry.google/policies/registration/new/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI focused new BI products are a wash, your focus should be a new BI product with maybe an AI integration (Not the other way around), or an AI integration to an existing BI product. The BI tool Kanaries / PyGWalker is a good example of where python based BI tooling should be going, replacing big corp BI tools to get CDO/CIO's to go the direction of abandoning Tableau/PBI for lower infra and platfrom cost, open source tooling &amp; integration.I am not saying its a bad idea, but your net is wide, very wide, you are trying to conquer two separate area. Both areas need innovation in the data space, but I think the AI rush is dieing down. Claude and GPT offer good support for PowerBI and Tableau, but there are no  extension integrations. This is where BI AI should be, AI's integrated into Tableau workbooks editing the core XML of the workbooks, offering translation tooling to convert Prep to Alteryx, Tableau to PBI...etc.It's also hard sell if your core platform doesn't cover SSO, Encryption, DB integrations, Self Deployment, RBAC's, PenTest, Corps looks for these things immediately, and BI tools are purely a Corp thing not a Consumer thing.That said its a cool idea and implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello fellow builder. I think the BI space is definitely ripe for change and I do wish more products had better dashboards for users!That being said, embedded analytics is a tough space, because established BI tools (PowerBI, etc.) can be used and are preferred by data teams, or software engineers just fiddle directly with things like plotly or highcharts.Similarly by now "AI Analytics" is getting crowded: https://github.com/Snowboard-Software/awesome-ai-analyticsLooking forward to watching your journey and ideas!FYI, we're building https://getdot.ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612237</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always wondered who else uses Ruby on Rails besides the usual names like GitHub, Shopify, Basecamp, etc.Last month, I built a directory of web apps built with the Rails framework.With Rails 8 released last year, the framework is stronger than ever. Some even say it’s experiencing a renaissance.There are already 21 submissions, and if you use Rails, you’re welcome to add your app or website!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails is probably one of the most complete, turnkey frameworks I’ve ever used for web development. When I first encountered it, within a day or two, I was building full stack crud apps.However, what shocked me, having come from a C/C++ background were the thousands of dependencies for the most simple of apps. This scared me as how could I possibly understand the security holes and inner workings of all these dependencies.Another problem I ran into was the tendency of rails developers to create monolithic applications with little separation between the UI, middle tier layer, and the data model layer. When I would be writing client side apps and interfacing with rails back ends, The rails teams would always implement new functionality into the website and then separately add functionality to an API. I think this comes down to the way people learn to develop in rails as rails teaches a monolithic method. I would always try to point out that creating an API where all of the logic was held, would make life so much easier for them, and they would agree, but continue to build The monolithic website with a separate API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails 8 made me love Rails again after a few years working with other tools. The new direction is just perfect, specially for solo developers. The 'solid trifecta' in combination with the simplicity of using sqlite3, the new built in auth solution, Kamal... everything, so f*ing good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656559</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "Makefile effect," a phenomenon where developers inadvertently create complex dependencies in their projects, similar to how a Makefile functions. It highlights how this can lead to unintentional complications in code maintenance and project structure, making it harder for developers to understand the relationships between different components. The author advises being mindful of this effect when organizing code and suggests practices to keep projects simple and manageable while avoiding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."– John Gall (1975) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Failhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an alternate theory: about 10% of developers can actually start something from scratch because they truly understand how things work (not that they always do it, but they could if needed). Another 40% can get the daily job done by copying and pasting code from local sources, Stack Overflow, GitHub, or an LLM—while kinda knowing what’s going on. That leaves 50% who don’t really know much beyond a few LeetCode puzzles and have no real grasp of what they’re copying and pasting.Given that distribution, I’d guess that well over 50% of Makefiles are just random chunks of copied and pasted code that kinda work. If they’re lifted from something that already works, job done—next ticket.I’m not blaming the tools themselves. Makefiles are well-known and not too verbose for smaller projects. They can be a bad choice for a 10,000-file monster—though I’ve seen some cleanly written Makefiles even for huge projects. Personally, it wouldn’t be my first choice. That said, I like Makefiles and have been using them on and off for at least 30 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make and Makefiles are incredibly simple when they are not autogenerated by autoconf. If they are generated by autoconf, don’t modify them, they are a build artifact. But also, ditch autoconf if you can.In the broader sense: yes this effect is very real. You can fall to it or you can exploit it. How I exploit it: write a bit of code (or copy/paste it from somewhere). Use it in a project. Refine as needed. When starting the next project, copy that bit of code in. Modify for the second project. See if changes can be backported to the original project. Once both are running and are in sync, extract the bit of code and make it into a library. Sometimes this takes more projects to distill the thing into what a library should be. In the best case, open source the library so others can use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42663231</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The go-haystack project on GitHub is an open-source library designed for the Go programming language, aimed at facilitating the integration and operation of the Haystack data modeling standard, which is commonly used in building automation and management systems. The library provides tools for encoding and decoding Haystack data sets, as well as utilities for managing points and tags within the context of building systems. It aims to streamline the development of applications that utilize Haystack by offering a robust framework for handling the associated data efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

What’s stopped me from using anything like this ever is the fact that I’m confident that at some point Apple will either embrace this sort of piggybacking on the network and open it up more officially, or it will ban any Apple ID that has ever been associated with such things. Right now they know about this and are not commenting either way.Hope in the future either Apple supports this more officially, or there is a way to use it with no direct link to my Apple ID or account. Until then, I am a spectator in these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Story time. My wife and I were vacationing in Portugal last summer. She left her purse in a uber car on the way to the airport. The driver found the purse and dumped it after taking 20$ and some costume jewellery. We tracked it to an abandoned parking lot later that day using an AirTag and we ended up finding it using the Location app. We have AirTags in every bag now and we change the batteries on a schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope in the future we can determine the position of beacons to within a cubic metre or less.My wife has ADD and she loses items often. Tiles aren't very loud and are flaky, we don't have an iPhone to use Airtags. I'm too exhausted to try to master the math needed to locate Bluetooth beacons, but I wish I could. I'd love for there to be a "just add 4 small Bluetooth boards" kind of software project, but it doesn't seem to scratch that itch for most open source devs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42665367</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've burnt out. It was horrible. I am doing much better now!The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.In many places if you get hurt/burnt out on the job the upper seats are looking for any reason to curb stomp you. There's no reason to give a company your all unless you have an actual stake in it or they are there to hold you up when you're dragging. I've worked at multiple places where influential people died, yes dead, below average life expectancy, - on the job - and corporate did everything they could to not even pay out on their legal obligations (life insurance, D&amp;D). In some cases employees joked or snickered about the person who died later on - in meetings.In tech. I've found that you're not on your own but you are at the mercy of who is in charge of your schedule and rates your performance. If you lose trust in that person your best option is to leave as quickly as possible. Otherwise they will do what they can to destroy you for as much 'profit' as they can claim. Being clear. It is not about realized gains, it could even be at great detriment to a company. It is about short-term line item claimable gains. "We got 4 good months out of her...", "they were terminal and now they will be working somewhere better for them...", "he really wasn't closing as many tickets as the rest of the team...", "they weren't helping as many team members as the rest of the team...", "we never needed someone with an advanced degree...", etc.Check in with yourself regularly. Know the signs of burn out. The company you work for does not depend on any person caring about you in the slightest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My theory on burnout is that it arises when the effort you put in doesn't have a meaningful impact because of misalignment or a lack of autonomy. It's like pushing on a lever but the gears are jammed. You're asked to push and push harder, but nobody in a position of power is willing to fix the damn gears.I've worked harder than imaginable in my life on projects without burning out, because the work was incredibly fulfilling — and it fit well with my core beliefs, interests, values. And then I've burnt out from putting tons of unrecognized effort into projects where I lacked adequate leverage to change things.People won't always look after you and burnout can be hard to recover from — harder than you might think. So take care of yourself — and never stop looking for work that aligns with your core values, interests, and the kind of life you want to build.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My own conclusion about burnout is that it fundamentally comes down to who controls the agenda, and how much you invest in that agenda.  I've been burned out.  Many years ago, early in my career.  My cure: I was in the lucky position that it was a good time to spend a year and half going back to school to knock off a graduate degree that simultaneously moved my career forward, gave me a total change of scenery, and gave me some break time between leaving the job and starting classes, time that I devoted 100% to hobbies and home improvement projects.  And of course, an easy-to-tell story when reentering the job market.So on the topic of agenda... if what you are working on is your own agenda, you don't burn out.  You might change the agenda by redefining goals, but in the end, you are sailing your own ship.  Not only do you not burn out, it is curative.  It is when you absorb someone else's agenda and make it your own to an unhealthy extent that you burn out.  Always be computing that dot product between your employer's agenda vector and your own agenda vector.  Don't over-invest beyond that dot-product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645859</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "De-smarting the Marshall Uxbridge" discusses the implications and challenges of simplifying the UI/UX of the Marshall Uxbridge smart speaker. It examines the balance between maintaining essential smart features while making the device more user-friendly for those who may not be tech-savvy. The author argues that a simplified interface could enhance user experience without significantly compromising functionality, enabling broader accessibility and appeal for users who prefer straightforward devices.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're going through all the effort to design a PCB have you thought about driving the I2S input digitally? I skimmed through the AD85050 datasheet and it has internal DSP functionality which would have been already tuned for the drivers and box by Marshall. The reason powered boxes sound decent despite their relatively cheap hardware is because of the extensive processing they have in the background to compensate for any hardware defiencies.As the AD85050 has a stereo I2S input there's a possibility for the actual crossover to be either done on the amp chip itself (with the same signal driving both channels) or done on the Amlogic SOC. The latter would be ugly as you would need another DSP chip on your board to do the crossover functionality, or perhaps you could program the AD85050 via I2C to add the appropiate low and high pass filters.A two channel A/D converter would work on the front end, as you could drive both channels with a single analog input to get a stereo I2S out with duplicate channels to drive the amp. A USB input would be much messier if you want true stereo using two speakers unless you plan on doing routing on the software side. With SPDIF you probably could get away with splitting the signal and using a SPDIF to I2S converter chip in each speaker, but you would still need some way to separate out the left and right channels. The AD85050 has mixing functionality via I2C which may help with that.And of course, all this might be more work than desigining an amp in the first place, and it really depends if you want to explore the analog or digital side of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have this speaker and cannot believe how annoying the smart features are. I'll be talking on the phone in my apartment and the speaker will think I'm trying to prompt it."SORRY. YOUR DEVICE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. PLEASE CHECK YOUR BLUETOOTH SETTINGS AND TRY AGAIN." (at max volume!)It's unbelievable. I'm not an EE, but would love to know how I can disable these incredible unsmart features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lately I've been wondering if there's a way to do this to Smart TVs. Personally, I like the name "stupify" better ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666572</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of PVS (Potentially Visible Set) portals in the Quake engine to manage visibility and optimize rendering in 3D environments. It explains how portals function by segmenting spaces to determine which areas are visible from a given point, thereby reducing rendering load. The piece also covers the implementation of these portals in Quake, detailing technical aspects and offering insights into how they improve performance in complex game levels. Overall, it highlights the significance of effective visibility management in game design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting with Quake II, designers were able to place "area portals" which are portals programmers could toggle at runtime (think disabling a doorway portal when the door is closed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I recall Prey being the first game to hype portals for rendering, though I think theirs may have been for drawing not just culling? Does anyone know how it worked?Dark Forces apparently also used portals for culling, IIRC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42661185</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN family! I found a few bugs for Phi-4 - Microsoft's latest MIT licensed LLM to be on par with GPT-4o mini1. End of sentence should be &lt;|im_end|&gt; not &lt;|endoftext|&gt;2. Chat template should not auto add an assistant prompt3. Padding token should not be EOS but &lt;|dummy_87|&gt;I also converted Phi-4 to Llama-arch. I uploaded GGUFs, 4bit quants, dynamic quants and all fixes to https://huggingface.co/unslothI also made a Colab notebook to finetune Phi-4 on a free GPU: https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update: The Phi-4 team is actively working on adding all our fixes into the original model! https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4/discussions/21&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi. It's nice to see these fixes.I got a question after checking results on the open LLM leaderboard[1].Comparing the result of NyxKrage/Microsoft_Phi-4 and microsoft/phi-4 or unsloth/phi-4, I can see fixing both the tokenizer and chat template causes the performance of both IFEval and BBH to increase. However, the performance on MATH, GPQA and MUSR degrades A LOT.Is there any explanation on why this is happening?[1] https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660335</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Stellar work. The TS looks really proper on first glance. I think you're right on zeitgeist -- we're going to need a lot more fundamental tools like this to build AI apps.Technically speaking, I've long wondered about mount/unmount of components as panels are dragged about and their visibility changed. Sometimes it's more costly to mount/unmount than to display:none.Second, you have basically a declarative structure for these panels, are there plans to expose a Vite plugin for example that could export saved TS layouts, where functions (ie: TS imports) map to the panel contents? (trying to think outside of JSX and more vanilla TS)Fantastic work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this compare to golden layout?  Inspired by it?I really enjoyed that project back in the day, but unfortunately support completely stopped (it had some folks take over, but I didn't see a real feasible upgrade path despite their passionate work on updating it).This looks great!  I'd be interested in giving it a try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I maintain a tiling wm written in Rust, and I just cannot imagine having the patience to do this kind of work in JS/TS. My respect to mathuo! One of the coolest things I've seen on HN recently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666492</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of Ruby's lazy enumerators, showcasing a simple technique to enhance understanding of their functionality. It describes how lazy enumerators allow for efficient data processing by creating enumerables that compute values on demand, rather than generating all values at once. The author provides practical examples and code snippets to illustrate how lazy enumerators can be utilized to improve performance in Ruby applications, emphasizing their usefulness in handling large datasets and optimizing memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I learned Haskell in college I was blown away by how laziness enables cool things like dealing with infinite lists or more performance even though the UX is exactly the same. (Apparently with Ruby there is the slight hint of adding the lazy method in between)Later I found out laziness in the whole system by default leads to some difficult issues, which quite a few people seem to agree with. Simon Peyton Jones (Haskell co-creator) apparently has said "The next Haskell will be strict". (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14011943)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So in Ruby, `map` and `select` are eager-by-default, but you can just write `lazy.map().select()` to make the whole chain lazy? That's really nice - much better than Python 2, which was also eager-by-default and you had to change every function call to make it lazy (`map` =&gt; `imap`, `filter` =&gt; `ifilter`).Python 3 changed to being lazy-by-default. I assume that improves CPU/memory usage, but in some cases it does have less predictable behaviour. I can see why Ruby, with its goal of "developer happiness", would choose to retain the predictable behaviour of eager-by-default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently Typescript doesn’t have anything built-in like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639581</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage addresses frequently asked questions regarding the compatibility of XYplorer, a file management software, with Visual Basic 6 (VB6). It outlines specific issues that users may encounter when integrating or using VB6 with XYplorer and provides solutions or workarounds. Key points include technical details about VB6's limitations and behaviors, as well as recommendations for ensuring smoother functionality between XYplorer and VB6 applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For no specific reason other than life random offers I've gone through a few of those "dead and bad" reputational language in my career (VB6, Delphi, PHP), mostly as a case of "there is a lot of money being a decent programmer who can use these correctly".And there are three things I learned about it1. There is a lot more money in it than you would think. The good part of "there is a lot of newbie using it" is that there is a lot of newbie using it and tons of software in it out there, and once you prove you know what you're doing you drown in high paid work, and with a bit of job selection it's not the bad horrible maintenance kind but decent fun too.2. There is no need trying to argue with people about it online or whatever. You're not going to convince anyone they're better language than they think. PHP 8 is a top notch language and people are still dumping on it using php 4 things.3. Ultimately there are people who spend their time talking about what language is right and people who get things done, build something great and it doesn't matter if it's cpp or Javascript or whatever. So at the end of day I've made a fair bit of money improving or building stuff used by lots of people to generate tons of revenue, and everyone involved is happy about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using XYplorer for 10 years now and it's fantastic. There are just so many features and quality of life improvements over the Windows explorer.It's written by a single person, and they're very responsive. I've recently reported a bug with the search (the first that I've noticed in all those years), and it's been fixed within a day. I'm only worried about the bus factor a little.I have a GitHub repo with some of my settings/scripts/notes for XYplorer if someone's interested: https://github.com/darekkay/config-files/tree/master/xyplore...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think VB is totally fine. It's a pragmatic solution to a real problem, and the ugliest things about it today are all a product of hindsight.On the other hand, this rubs me the wrong way:&gt; So, wouldn’t it be logical to conclude: If such an application can be written in VB6 then VB6 cannot be that bad after all?Yes, it absolutely could be bad. Our industry consists, in no small part, of turd polishing. Plenty of good software is written in bad (or ill-fitted) languages, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623387</guid></item><item><title>12.

It's neat that they thought to turn it into a tourist thing rather than fill it in. Sometimes, the most expedient choice isn't the best one.If you're ever downtown, checkout the Chihuly installations in the main library. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fiesta-tower&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grew in San Antonio as well and one of the best parts about the Riverwalk is that it offers a fantastic pedestrian corridor across almost the entirety of downtown San Antonio and connects a lot of really interesting places, The missions down south, Pearl Brewery and it's shopping district, downtown mall and Convention center as well as La Villita and The Art Museum.Sure you can walk the streets but getting around via the Riverwalk is actually extremely pleasant. I really love how convinient of a convention city San Antonio is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting and refreshing choice to stick to a pure textual description without the usual torrent of photos. Needs frequent looking up of terms though :-)As for the river walk itself, living in Amsterdam predisposes you to treat the bone-dry, car infested asphalt and concrete jungles we call cities as weird places where humanity aggregates for ritualistic suffering. Discovering that San Antonio is different was a great and pleasant surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42628248</guid></item><item><title>13.

I can’t even type that with straight fingers. There were no tests.Intensely relatable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading this, I am now of the belief that software is, actually, a good thing.

&lt;p&gt;The Wends of Texas refers to a group of Slavic immigrants, primarily from the Lusatia region of eastern Germany, who settled in Texas in the mid-19th century. They were drawn by the promise of land and opportunity, significantly impacting the area's cultural development. The Wends maintained their unique cultural practices, language, and traditions, particularly in the community of Serbin, Texas. Over time, assimilation into American society led to a decline in the use of their native language, though efforts continue to preserve their heritage. The site provides detailed information on their history, cultural practices, and contributions to Texas's identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress, took action to deactivate the accounts of several contributors who were planning to create a fork of WordPress. This decision came amid tensions within the community regarding the direction and governance of the platform. Mullenweg's move sparked debates about innovation versus adherence to the original project, as well as the implications for contributors who wish to pursue alternative development paths. The situation highlights the challenges of managing open-source projects and the complexities involved in balancing community interests with leadership decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been contributing for 20 years to the project, am a committer, and built several large parts of WordPress including the REST API.Matt is banning anyone who speaks out at all, even when they agree with points he’s made. A large group of contributors felt they had to make an anonymous statement from fear of the same retribution I suffered: https://www.therepository.email/core-contributors-voice-conc...(I am a less active direct contributor these days, so I’m still able to contribute even while blocked - but many people’s livelihoods depend on it, as sponsored contributors.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TechCrunch headline is not accurate. As far as I understand, none of the people whose WordPress accounts were deactivated were planning a fork.The current top comment and discussion on this Reddit thread provide good context:https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1hylx50/matt_tro...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From Mullenweg (https://wordpress.org/news/2025/01/jkpress/):&gt; To make this easy and hopefully give this project the push it needs to get off the ground, I’m deactivating the .org accounts of Joost, Karim, Se Reed, Heather Burns, and Morten Rand-Hendriksen. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to try different leadership models or align with WP Engine to join up with their new effort.He seems to be justifying the deactivation by claiming it will 'help them', somehow?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667766</guid></item><item><title>16.

I often want to visualize a planned route or verify if a GPX file I have downloaded from somewhere has any obvious problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to tinker with the Babylon.js code for the 3D visualizations, I made a standalone, sandbox-like repo, which is much easier to set up:https://github.com/r-follador/CubeTrek_Babylon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660255</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "Very Wrong Math," Charles Petzold discusses the complexities and misconceptions surrounding mathematical concepts often encountered in the context of computer science. He emphasizes the importance of clarity in mathematical reasoning and argues that oversimplified or incorrect interpretations can lead to significant misunderstandings in both theoretical and practical applications. Petzold uses examples to illustrate common pitfalls in mathematical logic and encourages readers to approach math with rigor and precision to avoid these errors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have seen a very similar (incorrect) argument used to justify the idea of a flat earth.  A builder on youtube made the argument (with a similar out of scale drawing of the earth) that if he drops a plumb bob and makes a right angle so he has a straight horizontal line and then goes across that line for a bit and drops another plumb bob, the two lines he has dropped are parallel, "proving" that the surface of the earth must be parallel to the horizontal line and therefore flat and not curved.  If the earth's surface was actually curved he argued then the two lines he has dropped should tilt slightly inward towards each other.  Which of course they do. The earth is just much much much bigger than in the diagram so the effect is within the margin of error for the measurement he was taking.As a meta point, our intuition often fails us hilariously when we are dealing with stuff that is out of the scale we have commonly seen in our lives. We joke about LLMs hallucinating but I'm not convinced we are so superior when we are outside our personal "training data".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth#Implicat....The takeaway is that the extra length of the arc is likely much smaller than one would intuitively expect. The problem is usually framed like so: If you wrapped a rope around the earth, how much more rope would you need to add so that it would be 1 meter above the ground at all points? The answer is only 2π meters!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if the math of the arc length was correct (and you don't need to be a math professor to figure out it isn't) there's another logic misstep.Implied in the caption is that the speed is the same at all heights (given that an increase in distance is implied as an increase in time.)This is again obvious nonsense - speed is a function of thrust versus drag, and it's safe to say that both of those are affected by air density.It becomes even less true once one gets to space. There height is a function of speed which means that to "catch up" something in front of you, you need to slow down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42661432</guid></item><item><title>18. 17th-century priory in France converted into a medieval-inspired topiary garden</title><link>https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/gallery/prieure-de-vauboin-garden</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The website presents resources and materials focused on teaching English language and grammar, primarily for adult learners. It includes explanations of English rules, various exercises for practice, and tips for improving language skills. The aim is to help learners gain confidence in their English proficiency through clear guidelines and helpful educational content. Additionally, the site emphasizes the importance of understanding grammar as a foundation for effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;English spelling could be significantly improved by adding a few optional accents. They could be purely additive: the ASCII spellings would remain valid for those who prefer to use them.Native English speakers don’t seem to quite grasp how difficult the spelling is. I’ve been using this language for thirty years and I sometimes forget how some basic words are pronounced because I mostly write it.There’s no need to change physical keyboards. In the smartphone era, most English around the world is already being typed using soft keyboards and autocomplete. A spelling reform could be agreed between Google, Apple and Microsoft. They are the de facto equivalent of Académie Française for the English language, even if they don’t use that power.Here’s my basic suggestion for the optional accent marks:A long vowel is marked with an acute accent. The sound is simply the one you’re familiar with from how the alphabet is pronounced. This lets us distinguish between léad (the verb) and lead (the metal), live (the verb) and líve (as in streaming), lów and how, féar and bear, bléak and break, infinite and fíníte, etc.It also fixes the spelling of many loan words that look like the final e would be silent and today you just have to know it’s not: catastrophé, epitomé, Eurydicé, etc.This easy rule doesn’t nearly cover all the weird vowel spellings, but it already fixes a substantial part of the worst obstacles for English learners.Two more accent marks could be deployed:The macron is already familiar to Japanese learners. It’s a long version of the short vowel sound, as in Ōsaka. The spelling of many English loan words could be unified by deploying the macron consistently. It would allow replacing é with ē in French loan words like fiancē.The grave accent could be used to assign a third vowel sound, but it’s not as obvious what this should be. As an example, maybe for the letter A, it could be the sound in words like àll and hàul and àwe. Again, the point would be to give a consistent and useful hint of a sound that doesn’t follow the basic rules, not to make the spelling perfect in one stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading and writing are different transformations - they are not complementary or inverse - they are just different.Phonics gives you some clues to remember a word, context gives you other clues. Eventually, you may learn what kinds of words come from Latin, Greek, and French, and those are more clues. But before those clues do anything at all for you, you have to care and want to read.Four righting ewe jest halve two remmemmber thee spellin.&gt; "There's an idea about how children learn to read that's held sway in schools for more than a generation — even though it was proven wrong by cognitive scientists decades ago.

Can she reclaim her good name?"Gift link: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/lucy-ca...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really, English is sort of a patchwork quilt. English spelling starts making sense if you also know the spelling of several of the source languages it borrowed from. French especially important; Latin and Greek via french IIRC; and maybe German and Dutch or so for the Saxon side of things.The confusion happens when (Anglo)-Saxon, French, and Greek words all happen to collide.Or I would say that, but then I looked at one of the first given examples: Corpse and Corps, not actually from two different languages. Actually borrowed from Latin "corpus" (body) via french twice .  [1]You still get quite a bit of traction if you know those other languages, but ... that one is particularly bad!See also: Ghoti (Supposedly can validly be pronounced "Fish")* "Gh" = /f/ (laugh)  : A sound that doesn't exist in english anymore, but does in german" "Lach", which is pronounced roughly the same as in old english). Or, if you want a word you might recognize: "Loch", which is the Scottish Gaelic word for Lake.* "O" = /ɪ/ (women) : Actually english, from the great vowel shift I think?* "Ti" = /ʃ/ (nation) : Nation is actually a french word, borrowed wholesale including the original spelling.

We know we will have N3 GPU next year, and they should be working with TSMC on capacity planning for N2. Currently Blackwell is pretty much limited by capacity of either TSMC, HBM or packaging. And unless the AI hype dies off soon ( which I doubt will happen ), we should still have at least another 5 years of these GPU improvements. We will have another 5 - 10x performance increase.And they have foreshadowed their PC entry with MediaTek Partnership. ( I wonder why they dont just acquired Mediatek ) and may be even Smartphone or Tablet with Geforce GPU IP.The future is exciting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related ongoing thread:Ask HN: Pull the curtain back on Nvidia's CES keynote please - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808 - Jan 2025 (2 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nvidia Project Digits looked rather interesting.

Initializing it globally in this code would result in the compiler generating some instructions to be run before main() is called, which we can’t very easily patch into the original binary.Assuming your increase the size of the binary, change the first instruction to jump to the end of the program, do your magic, perform the original first instruction, and finally jump to the second instruction. If the program itself does not self modify or otherwise examine its own size, this would get you to the original start with your modifications applied.&gt; In the end, it took about 8 hours to get this project finished, which was spread out over multiple weeks.That’s incredible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't enable code protection on the PIC.If I were in need of a mod like this, I'd just wire another switch in parallel to control the appropriate solenoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645415</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Moravec's Paradox is often misapplied when considering LLMs vs. robotics. It's true that formal reasoning over unambiguous problem representations is easy and computationally cheap. Lisp machines were already doing this sort of thing in the '70s. But the kind of commonsense reasoning over ambiguous natural language that LLMs can do is not easy or computationally cheap. Many early AI researchers thought it would be — that it would just require a bit of elaboration on the formal reasoning stuff — but this was totally wrong.So, it doesn't make sense to say that what LLMs do is Moravec-easy, and therefore can't be extrapolated to predict near-term progress on Moravec-hard problems like robotics. What LLMs do is, in fact, Moravec-hard. And we should expect that if we've got enough compute to make major progress on one Moravec-hard problem, there's a good chance we're closing in on having enough to make major progress on others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh weird to wake up to see something I wrote more than half year ago (and posted on HN with no traction) getting reposted now.Glad to see so many different takes on it. It was written in slight jest as a discussion starter with my ML/neuroscience coworker and friends, so it's actually very insightful to see some rebuttals.Initial post was twice the length, and had several more (in retrospect) interesting points. First ever blog post so reading it now fills me with cringe.Some stuff have changed in only half year, so will see if the points stands the test of time ;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Moravec’s paradox is the observation by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky, and others in the 1980s.I have a name for it now!I've said over and over that there are only two really hard problems in robotics: Perception and funding.  A perfectly perceived system and world can be trivially planned for and (at least proprio-)controlled. Imagine having a perfect intuition about other actors such that you know their paths (in self driving cars), or your map is a perfect voxel + trajectory + classification. How divine!It's limited information and difficulties in reducing signal to concise representation that always get ya. This is why the perfect lab demos always fail - there's a corner case not in your training data, or the sensor stuttered or became misaligned, or etc etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623255</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way I remember it: A* can find shortest path between any two given points; Djikstras can precompute the shortest path between a single point and all other points; And Floyd-Warshall can precompute the shortest path between all possible pairs of points.The author starts with Djikstras and updates the precomputed path-map every frame that either the players location changes or an obstacle is added.Maybe some more performance can be squeezed out. If the player's location changes more frequently than obstacles are added, it may be worthwhile to precompute the all-pairs-shortest-path (floyd-warshall) which would instead only need to be updated on obstacle additions. The precomputed path map would no longer need to be updated on player location changes.A similar trick can probably be used to efficiently update the precomputed APSP path-map in these cases, since only a single obstacle is added at a time.Though if obstacles are added fairly frequently relative to player location changes, this is probably not worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pathfinding is a profoundly interesting problem. I think it is very impressive that Starcraft II still has amazing lag-free pathfinding that beats or matches basically every game out there, including very recent RTS games like Stormgate and Zerospace that have a specific emphasis on smooth mechanics for competitive play. Like you can build all kinds of buildings and a zillion zerglings will instantly go around them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couldn’t you just do a breadth first flood fill from the player every time the environment changes?

&lt;p&gt;The article explores a fictional scenario in which Pablo Picasso is arrested for the theft of the Mona Lisa, blending historical context with imaginative storytelling. It examines Picasso's art and his relationship with theft in the context of creativity, as well as the cultural significance of the Mona Lisa. Through this narrative, the piece reflects on the intersection of art, crime, and identity, ultimately probing deeper philosophical questions about ownership and the nature of artistic genius.&lt;/p&gt;

It provides a detailed mathematical approach to understanding the effects of these holes on shell structures, including derivations, theoretical frameworks, and numerical examples. The findings are aimed at improving the design and analysis of shell-type structures in engineering, focusing on the mechanical implications of imperfections introduced by hole formations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had the "joy" of watching some guys from Perforce setup a new p4 instance.They confed /etc/sudoers so that the perforce user can run everything as root without providing a password. I told them that this is really a bad idea, and they pulled up one of their setup guides with "enhanced security hardening".It ended up with ~35 specific entries for binaries in sudoers, one of them being /usr/sbin/setcap - which allows you to give e.g. the Python interpreter CAP_SETUID, making a privilege escalation to root trivial again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loopholes of this kind exist these days as well.When I was working for a major retailer, who, you'd assume would have thought about these things well enough, you were prevented from executing sudo, except for being able to use it for text editing (sudo vi). I needed to install some packages with a root shell at the time, so I used the command execution feature within vi to get that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting aside all of the technical aspects of this, the history of this in the world of UNIX, I just love the process and bureaucracy that generated this specific paper document. The very formal cover sheet (and the fact that it had an accompanying, separate, numbered instruction document), the pre-determined layout and format of a Technical Memorandum, and the fact that this was published as such a memorandum with filing and control numbers that will be researched and looked up in a library instead of just a blog or post on MediumWe used to be a real society&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639871</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses significant flaws in the implementations of binary search and merge sort algorithms, which are widely used in computer science. Researchers from Google found that nearly all existing implementations of these algorithms contain subtle bugs that can lead to incorrect results. The blog highlights the importance of robust and error-free algorithm design and invites the community to adopt safer and more reliable coding practices to prevent common pitfalls associated with these essential algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally it's just a little excessive to try to solve the halting problem in a library's unit tests ;). You don't have to test a program for all possible inputs, only for all materially unique state transitions. In a binary search, each variable can be zero, one, some(*), max, overflowed. The combination of these is not infinite as the values of some that cause different behavior is much more reasonable when grouped into chunks of the same behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This bug, and many others, can be detected with a trivial amount of formal verification. I really think formal verification should see much wider use for things that see as much use as standard libraries, even if it's just for the trivial things like overflow and out-of-bounds access.In the below code we can see a formal verification tool (GNATProve) detect both the original error and the out-of-bounds access that it causes. Doing the arithmetic using a larger type clears both reported errors without the need for any additional annotations for GNATProve.    function Search (A : A_Type; Target : Integer) return Integer is
       Left : Integer := A'First;
       Right : Integer := A'Last;
    begin
       while Left &lt;= Right loop
          declare
             Mid : Integer := (Left + Right) / 2;
          begin
             if A (Mid) = Target then
                return Mid;
             elsif A (Mid) &lt; Target then
                Left := Mid + 1;
             elsif A (Mid) &gt; Target then
                Right := Mid - 1;
             end if;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of configuration languages, emphasizing the importance of elegance in their design and usability. It explores various characteristics that contribute to an elegant configuration language, such as clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness. The author compares different existing languages, highlighting how they meet or fail to meet these criteria while advocating for a more refined approach to designing configuration languages that enhance user experience and effectiveness in configuration management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a lot of words to describe a very simple syntax: name=value pairs, with line continuation using whitespace.Basically RFC822 email headers, or Debian Control File Format [0] but with "=" instead of ":", and without dedicated comment character.The biggest problem with this format is that a lot of things are left for the app, so each app will have its own way to implement lists, bools, line wrap support.. Even something like "value override" is left to program implementation. Don't expect YAML/JSON/XML-style automated validators/linters, each program will need its own bespoke parser/generator.[0] https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.ht...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the conciseness of this syntax. The language seems very well thought through.That being said, I've been working with NixOS recently and it's made me reconsider what is useful for a configuration language. In many reasonably large software projects, where configs become very complex, config reuse (in other words templating or meta-configuration) becomes an increasingly helpful feature. Nix configs are great because it's not just a config, but a full blown purely functional language for manipulating the config. It's intuitive and powerful once you get the hang of it, and I sometimes find myself wishing I could use it when I have to work with yaml, json, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone is entitled to scratch their own itch, but this seems like the most useless configuration language I've ever seen.Take the "fixed point" example, where you have a boolean setting which one file says should should be "yes" and the other says it should be "no" and the language semantics composes that into a list with both values. For what boolean setting does this make sense?The article says "Overrides are not a problem because you keep both values. And you can decide what to do with them: keep only the first, keep only the last or use some smart logic to combine both of them. You’re the boss."If you need custom logic in your application determine the setting to use, how is this language helping you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42615006</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation and usage of hash maps in Bash scripting. It explains how hash maps can be created, manipulated, and accessed in Bash, emphasizing their utility for associating keys with values. The author provides clear examples of adding, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs, as well as demonstrating how to iterate through a hash map. Additionally, the article highlights some common use cases and best practices for effectively using hash maps in Bash scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh dear. I've been trying to get people to not use this feature for a while.One thing that has bitten me in the past is that, if you declare your associative arrays within a function, that associative array is ALWAYS global.
Even if you declare it with `local -A` it will still be global.
Despite that, you cannot pass an associative array to a function by value.  I say "by value" because while you can't call `foo ${associative_array}` and pick it up in foo with `local arg=$1, you can pass it "by reference" with `foo associative_array` and pick it up in foo with `local -n arg=$1`, but if you give the passed in dereferenced variable a name that is already used in the global scope, it will blow up, eg `local -n associative_array=$1`.As a general rule for myself when writing bash, if I think one of my colleagues who has an passable knowledge of bash will need to get man pages out to figure out what my code is doing, the bash foo is too strong and it needs to be dumbed down or re-written in another language.  Associative arrays almost always hit this bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s amazing how much of a superpower merely reading the manual is nowadays.&lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Arrays&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not only do they exist, but they have some fantastic foot guns! https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#A.5B.5B_-v_hash.5B....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631815</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of unnamed placeholders in C++26, a new feature aimed at simplifying the use of generic lambdas and function templates. It highlights how this feature allows developers to omit explicit names for template parameters, thereby making code more concise and easier to read. The author explains the potential benefits and use cases of unnamed placeholders, providing examples to illustrate their implementation. Additionally, the article addresses the implications for existing C++ codebases and the broader impact on the language's usability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am so shocked at how many people use `auto` in C++. I can not think of a worse thing to do to your code in terms of readability and future maintainability. Maybe it is OK if you use an IDE to identify types for you but I still hate it. I am trying to learn a new library right now with light documentation which means reading the code, and between typedefs, auto, and technical debt, it is a tedious exercise to figure out something's type, to go look up its function, to see what type that is returning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes me wonder when '_' was first used as a token to denote unused information. Prolog ? ML ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a convoluted mess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42636571</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worth noting if someone uses this to share private data: Checking the "Private torrent" would tell your and compliant clients to not use DHT and other public methods that can leak the content. But it doesn't stop other non-compliant clients from sharing it on the DHT once they have it, nor does it stop someone from just ticking "Enable DHT" on their side once they have received it (or change "private" to "false" in the torrent file itself).Obvious to many I'm sure, but maybe best to be explicit about it anyways.Slightly off-topic but kind of fitting: How does infohash v2 support look like today? It's been available for years, but seemingly most private trackers + most other places seems to still be using v1. What clients are people using today, do those support v2? As far as I know, all modern clients do, so it would be possible to start using v2 exclusively.Reason for the question is that I'm planning to distribute many large files to the public, and in my experience, BitTorrent works really well for that. Question is if it's enough to just publish v2 infohashes, or I need to publish both v1 and v2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this. I continue to believe Torrenting is the best way to share files, particularly big files, rather than uploading them to some cloud instance with questionable privacy policies…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a self-hostable BitTorrent tracker that can run with Docker? I know there's an option on qBittorrent but I don't want my server to run a full BitTorrent client; just the tracker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42664409</guid></item><item><title>32.

You're not doing much with that plain javascript couldn't do just as well if not better. Plain JS has come a long way since jQuery first came out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; there are many log services available and this is my attempt at a better one.Out of curiosity, can you describe how your service is better than others?&gt;I hope my application fixes most of these issuesDo you care to elaborate on the "how"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious about the open source nature of this and how you / people in general manage a project where you are hosting it and need to maintain its security, but are also presumably merging pull requests as people contribute to the project. I would be quite paranoid about this, ie concerned that someone might slip a line of code in with the intent of breaching the service that I would not catch during code review. I know this is true of any open source project but it feels especially fraught when you are also hosting it and letting people sign up and pay for it. I’m wondering if you or others have experience with this and what approaches and practices mitigate this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666139</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the essay, the author (David Mason) quotes the beginning of Cinderella. I agree with Mason about the beauty of the terse prose here:&gt; So much is conveyed here about character, time and the natural world, because Cinderella’s piety is natural piety, respect for nature more than conventional Christian belief.It's something that modern fantasy usually doesn't capture, by being too modern, and by being far too verbose. The latter is one aspect in which Tolkien's Simarillion feels better than his "The Lord of the Rings": The Simarillion leaves all the details out, it has little direct speech, and only mentions what's important. Its style is not as raw and authentic as in Grimm's fairy tales, or as in actual historical legends like King Arthur, but it gets close as times, mainly by avoiding the verbosity that is so common in all modern literature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42638706</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the rising tide of loneliness in American society, exploring its roots in personality, politics, and social dynamics. It discusses how changes in interpersonal relationships, driven by factors like technology and individualism, contribute to feelings of isolation. The piece also highlights the alarming implications of loneliness on mental health and political behavior, suggesting that this pervasive issue may have deep-seated effects on the fabric of American life, influencing everything from voter turnout to civic engagement. Ultimately, the article calls for a deeper understanding of loneliness as a critical social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of people who are lonely and wish they had something to do means that when I ask someone to coffee, drinks, or just to hangout, chances are they'll say yes. I'm an active member of one of my city's discord servers, so there's a substantial pool to draw from. I've organized in person book clubs, movie nights, and group coffee outings, all from the same pool.More recently, I've engaged with my city's kink community which has no shortage of public socials. I'm at the point where I have to be choosy about how I want to spend my time because it's easy to get over booked.Maybe I have higher initiative than most, but I found the experience to be dependent on how much effort I put into it and incredibly rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think old distinction between the words "unsociable" meaning not wanting to socialise, and "anti-social" meaning causing trouble to society, is useful. I guess I'm swimming against the tide with this one though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662340</guid></item><item><title>37.

Clicking OK - displays the same box over and over until the battery is &gt;10%, I'm not interested in ordering a replacement battery for this, it's a toy at this point.oh software people.I'd be figuring out how I can jump some leads with the "right" voltage to the battery's leads to see if I can fool it (and hopefully not explode the leads), though might not work with OP's weird 255%/100%/0% simultaneous battery level reporting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dell BIOS updates usually have a switch to override the battery check. I remember /force working on some models, and then they changed it to something more obscure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be funny to if the person finds out there are command line arguments that force the update.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637057</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;A rare astronomical event involving the alignment of seven planets in the solar system is set to occur soon, offering a spectacular sight for skywatchers. This alignment includes Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which will be visible in the early morning hours. The article discusses the significance of such alignments, how to observe them, and the best times for viewing, emphasizing that these events are infrequent and offer a unique opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech.net is a web hosting service that emphasizes affordable and flexible hosting solutions for users, particularly those seeking to maintain free speech online. The FAQ section highlights their commitment to supporting a wide range of viewpoints, while also drawing a firm stance against hate speech and extremist ideologies, including nazism. The service aims to provide a platform that balances free expression with responsible content management, allowing individuals and organizations to host their websites without undue restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly free speech for me is one of those services still (excellently) run by nerds.Its no-frills, functional UI reminds me of the old internet before services and sites began coalescing into bigger, faceless, soulless monoliths. I didn’t know about this policy before today, but now I love them even more.If you’re looking for a place to host your next project or domain, I can’t recommend them enough!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This relies on an EA adjacent market fallacy where we can resolve all moral action down to funding actors of various moral alignments - there's no reason to believe that the end utility (or whatever metric) of the action is linear w.r.t amount of cash moved.Garage band EvilWebsite.com is going to appreciate that 5$ way more than the SPLC or whatever.This isn't to say that the policy is strictly bad, I just worry that it reinforces pretty negative patterns. Carbon offsets barely work, and that's an actual market - bigotry offsets are a dark line to walk.(edit - misread the policy; it's not about matching cash flows through the service to offending websites, it's donating profits from offending costumers. That seems more consistent to me.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is kinda neat.&gt; 2. The recipient organization is as opposite (and hopefully as offensive) as possible to the site operator that funded the donation.This is vulnerable to "false flag" abuse, from faux-morons.&gt; 1. The recipient organization does share our values.This partly mitigates that risk.Faux-morons can still generate more funds for recipients chosen by the site, and/or hurt the profitability of the site, but at least it's for causes within the values of the site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42663923</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was the subject of https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03719. (I suspect you can do simpler than the paper's solution if you're only interested in the top-k.)A related topic is "token healing", although some implementations (unfortunately including the one in HuggingFace Transformers) make some big assumptions that aren't always true (like treating spaces as special).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Can you construct an efficient algorithm for sampling from q(tk∣t1,…,tk−1), that minimizes calls to the original language model?I feel like I'm missing some issue here... Can't you query stopping at the last full token boundary, then reject any results which don't match the character prefix and continue from there with the completion? Kind of like when you mask the invalid actions when reinforcement training on games? Or is that losing too much info?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is harder than it looks.First "token-healing" doesn't work. Consider the case "app" where the most likely options are "ap|praisal" or "apple|sauce". You can't just sample all tokens that start with app, or you'd miss appraisal.Second, it's easy to come up with a naive algorithm that samples from the true distribution. It's very difficult to make this algorithm efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42632478</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a project called PET-Globe, which aims to create a sustainable approach to managing plastic waste by designing a functional, interactive globe made from recycled PET plastic. The project emphasizes the importance of recycling and the potential of PET materials to be repurposed for various innovative applications. It showcases how this initiative not only raises awareness about plastic pollution but also promotes a circular economy through creative design and collaboration. The PET-Globe serves as both an educational tool and a symbol of the ongoing efforts to address environmental challenges related to plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a number of years designing outer-runner direct drive permanent magnet motors for industrial equipment and I've got some questions.Cheifly, bearings. They're not shown in any of the oh-wow images, but these will likely be the most expensive component of each motor. Big bearings are expensive, and to accept the loading of normal wheel operation, these will have to be pretty beefy. That's not even discussing operational life and maintenance.After you've stuffed a pair of angular contact roller bearings into this "wheel", you're going to want to keep salt water and road grime from entering those bearings, so what do you use as a seal? Whatever you use is going to be big, expensive, and suck up huge amounts of power due to the large contact surface.Finally, once you've got big ass bearings and big ass seals, how do you have enough room to put a decent amount of copper in there? Power in these things always amounts to maximizing the amount of copper in the space, and I just don't see room for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first I was like "this is crazy, those are going to be crazy expensive, they'll never make it" and then I realized we're not the customers, at least not willinglyhttps://www.donutdefence.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More on their design can be found in their patents, https://patents.google.com/?assignee=verge+motorcycles&amp;oq=as...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's personal experiences with narcolepsy, highlighting its unusual symptoms and the impact it has on daily life. The author shares anecdotes that illustrate the often misunderstood aspects of the condition, such as unexpected sleep episodes and the challenges of functioning in a world that doesn't always recognize or accommodate those living with narcolepsy. Ultimately, it seeks to shed light on the realities of this neurological disorder, promoting understanding and empathy for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have some of those minor symptoms.One thing I have experienced is lying in bed and being unable to move, and I can't tell why. it seems like I'm just not trying to move, which I think is the feeling that distinguishes it from paralysis.What I have found is I can open my eyes and move them around. Through this I discovered an exercise that helps.  If I focus on the ceiling in the far left side of the room then switch to focusing on the far right, after about 5 to 10 if those switches, the rest of my body can move without issues.  Whatever it was that felt like I was just being lazy simply vanishes.My brain is weirdly configured.   I have had MRIs, catscans,  ultrasounds on though my eye (which is as it sounds,close your eye, pour some goopvon it, then waggle a gadget over the goop)Some of those were before I had Touretts like symptoms turn up.    All I really know at this point is there isn't a tumor in there.  I have a feeling some of my doctors would have placed money on finding one.I also had a thing where they covered me in electrodes and timed how long it took me to fall asleep, then immediately woke me up again to repeat the processSeparately I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on methylphenidate only to find it had no effect on anything (was like taking nothing at all). Now on Dexamphetamine with some benefits.The dramatic difference in how it feels to do something that previously seemed to require insurmountable effort has made me wonder if laziness is not actually a real thing. Those who have not experienced it may feel like you should just put your head down and do the task at hand, but the way the ability or inability to do that seems to switch on and off like a switch really doesn't make it seem like a factor of willpower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brother has narcolepsy. It is interesting how it presents itself in different people. I have never seen my brother fall asleep while occupied with something (walking, talking...) but I have seen him fall asleep so many times when he is not. 
The moment he gets in a car and it starts driving he falls asleep and very deeply. He would fall asleep in class all the time. The first time i really saw his narcolepsy expressed was during a daytime dinner. He had just had a big meal and while we were all sitting and talking, he just kinda nodded off.The sad part is he has felt quite embarrassed by all this growing up. These are not dangerous situations, but it just feels awkward for a teenager. He also talks and walk in his sleep. Even worse is that no one believed him when he suggested he might have narcolepsy. Our mom is a doctor but figured he was just tired like all young, growing boys. It took a brain scan to get it sorted.He's been prescribed Ritalin or something similar, but manages without.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fascinating. Three years ago, after recovering from COVID, along with many long haul symptoms I developed several similar to but still distinct from narcolepsy. Even now as the CFS-like symptoms have mostly faded, the narcoleptic symptoms are still present. Unfortunately I've not been able to get a positive diagnosis of any sort because it's atypical.There are two main symptoms I experience. First is that, often without any clear provocation, I will become very fatigued and weak. This usually occurs over about 20 minutes, but the initial onset is a distinct event I've come to recognize. It gives many of those same long COVID symptoms: brain fog and drowsiness, weakness to the point of struggling to stand up or keep my head up, uncoordinated movements, and a feeling like I've been up all night and I desperately need to sleep. This often subsides after an hour or two, but it may last several hours.The second which is perhaps just a more extreme case of the first is a complete inability to wake up. I may be slightly aroused and fade in and out of consciousness, but I have no ability to control this. I typically cannot move during this: everything feels so exceptionally tired and heavy that I feel like I don't have the strength to move anything, even to turn my head. Depending on how conscious I am at any moment, I may realize I'm in this situation, or I might imagine that I'm just really tired or depressed and that's why I can't move. These episodes tend to last many hours, often 8 or more. They can happen as an extension of my random bouts of sleepiness, but often they occur as an extension of my normal sleep, resulting in me not being able to wake up - even when physically aroused by someone else - until well into the evening.In both cases the sleep is not restful. Instead I often feel it come on again a few hours later, though less extreme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42653370</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Ford's Mach-E electric vehicle has achieved a significant milestone by outselling the gasoline-powered Mustang for the first time. This shift reflects the growing popularity of electric vehicles and the increasing consumer demand for EVs. The article discusses the implications of this trend for the automotive industry, highlighting Ford's commitment to electrification and the changing landscape of car sales, as more customers opt for electric over traditional combustion engines. The success of the Mach-E indicates a broader movement towards sustainable transportation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

EV Mustang is in my honest opinion the worst EV I have driven and I include golf carts and mobility scooters in this category. Yet it still outsells and ICE car which says something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never understood why the Mach-E is called Mustang.

Is salt really that bad? How long would they live if they followed WHO's recommendations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But does it work?This is the third report I’ve seen in recent days and none of them mention if the spoon delivers on its promise. Reporters may be reluctant to share a spoon with dozens of other attendees, but might they practice some journalism by surveying folks who did try it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This idea has been around for a long time:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Wikipedia search patterns can reflect different styles of curiosity among users. It highlights a study that analyzed search data to categorize individuals' interests as either broad or niche. The findings suggest that users with broad curiosity tend to explore a wide range of topics, while those with a niche focus delve deeply into specific subjects. This divergence in search behavior offers insights into how people seek knowledge and engage with information, revealing varying motivations and approaches to learning.&lt;/p&gt;

In countries with lower scores on these variables, people browsed like hunters. Bassett hypothesizes that “in countries that have more structures of oppression or patriarchal forces, there may be a constraining of knowledge production that pushes people more toward this hyperfocus.”This is an odd hypothesis and you know, I’ve read a little bit of enough about postmodernism/critical theory and its influence on hypertext to feel like this take is down right saditty.The need to try to sow conflict between “patriarchy” and “xetriarchy” by depicting one style of curiosity as more virtuous than the other dampens what looks like an otherwise interesting study.And it doesn’t help that the authors don’t appear to list or accessibly depict which countries were more inclined toward one style as opposed to the other.https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn3268If anyone can decipher the sophistry in the actual study, please let me know what’s going on here, especially in figure 8.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: Isaiah Berlin's "The Hedgehog and the Fox".

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to choose Common Lisp as their programming language of choice. The author outlines several compelling reasons, including the flexibility and power of Lisp's macro system, its ability to support multiple programming paradigms, and its suitability for complex problem-solving tasks and artificial intelligence. They also highlight the importance of Lisp's interactive development environment, which enhances productivity. Overall, the author advocates for Common Lisp as a valuable tool for developers seeking an expressive and efficient way to write programs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SBCL is a great choice! It's a surprisingly dynamic system (so are other CL implementations).A while ago, I did some private work for someone, using SBCL, and sent her the native binary I built, then forgot about the whole thing.The client came back with some new requirements much later, when the project was concluded, and the source code was already lost by that time.I vaguely remembered how I did things, so I spawned a REPL from the old binary, went into the relevant CL package, wrote a new function that overrides the old behavior, and the client's problem was solved.I did all those without the original source code. It was a small thing to fix, but I can't imagine making the same fix so swiftly with any other tech stack, when the source code is lost. I was deeply impressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is a very interesting journey — mine was exactly opposite, after many years with Common Lisp, I moved to Clojure and wouldn't even think of going back. I find it intriguing that the author would want to move in the other direction, especially as concurrency was mentioned (one of the main reasons why I initially looked at Clojure).I wonder what it was about babashka that didn't work for the author. When I need a quick script with batteries included, I use babashka and it works great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like vim-slime is essential to how you work with CL + vim. I've only used vim for not even 2 years, and came across vim-slime 6 months ago when working in ruby and wanting to quickly 'send' code from editor (neovim) to rails console. 2 months ago I launched a startup and for hours every day had to swat/fix repercussions of bugs that weren't apparent pre-launch (as well as doing via the console things users needed but weren't able to do because the feature to do it hadn't been built yet). It was daunting. I don't know how I'd have managed without vim + vim-slime. Probably a lot of copy/pasting from vscode. Vim + vim-slime was at least a 2x productivity improvement, and &gt;2x increase in developer happiness.Another huge benefit of vim and vim-slime is it is immediately valuable when you use/learn any new language. So long as the language has a REPL/console/interpreter that can be opened from the terminal or terminal emulator in any form (e.g. CL, ruby, python, bash etc etc etc) then vim + vim-slime will be a brilliant ~IDE. (Possibly the only thing I haven't been able to do but wanted to is 'send' code from neovim to the javascript console in chrome, which would be pretty awesome!)A side note: I found doom-emacs very similar to vim, only needed ~10 or so new keyboard shortcuts to be productive in emacs. (I still much prefer vim, but I'm not so down on emacs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671105</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a new exoplanet named "LTT 9779 b," which orbits a star located about 260 light-years from Earth. This exoplanet is notable for its unusual characteristics, including a very short orbital period of just 19 hours and a highly inflated size, suggesting it may have a gaseous atmosphere. The research, conducted using the European Southern Observatory's instruments, provides insights into the nature of such extreme exoplanets and contributes to the understanding of planet formation and evolution in different stellar environments. The findings are expected to prompt further studies and observations of similar exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm noticing that the reporting on this, including the ESO press release, is vague on exactly what this "industrial megaproject" happens to be.  Ordinarily, there is no hesitation to disclose this, unless it's a military matter.  Or a sacred cow.A sacred cow, indeed.  It's a green energy operation powered by both wind and solar to generate hydrogen, electricity and ammonia.  Here[1] is the AES Andes press release about this project, if you care to read the opposing spin on this matter:"AES Chile submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Chilean permitting authorities for a proposed industrial-scale green hydrogen project called Inna. The project, which is in early-stage development, could include a variety of solutions, including green hydrogen for export or domestic consumption, aligned with Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy."[1] https://www.aesandes.com/en/press-release/aes-andes-submits-...Land use.  It's not just a fossil fuel shill talking point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I lived in the Welsh countryside, there were occasional nights where I could not see my hand in front of my face. The requirements were that it was new moon, and that there was slight fog. We also lived deep in a valley, which helped. I had great fun navigating my way to the local pub in complete darkness.The odd thing is that when I recount that experience, some people refuse to believe me. Of course they are all city dwellers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be unthinkable to just NOT have bright lights pointed at the sky all night? Could they still do this project with severe restrictions on light emissions? If there’s some reason it absolutely must include hundreds of outdoor sodium vapor lights then build it somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42668953</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Cobol and its evolution into Cobvious, a modern programming language that retains the readability and business-oriented features of Cobol while incorporating modern programming concepts and practices. It highlights the potential of Cobvious to facilitate the use of legacy systems while enabling developers to write code that is easier to maintain and integrate with contemporary technologies. The purpose of the article is to explore the significance of reviving and adapting older programming languages to meet current software development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Header files are one of the things I miss the most about languages that aren't C. Having a very clear distinction between public and private, and interface and implementation is one of my favourite things about C code (at least the way I write it).Being able to just read through a library's .h files to know how to use it is really nice. Typically, my .h files don't really look like my .c files because all the documentation for how to use the thing lives in the .h file (and isn't duplicated in the .c file). It would be entirely possible to put this documentation into the .c file, but it makes reading the interface much less pleasant for someone using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the author has WAY more knowledge/experience than me on this and so I wonder how he would solve the following issues:Evaluating Constant Expressions- This seems really complicated...if you're working within a translation unit, thats much simplified, but then you're much more limited in what you can do without repeating a lot of code. I wonder how the author solves this.Compile Time Unit Tests- This is already somewhat possible if you can express your test as a macro, which if you add in the first point, then this becomes trivial.Forward Referencing of Declarations- I think there may be a lot of backlash to this one. The main argument against this is that it then changes the compiler from a one-pass to two pass compiler which has its own performance implications. Given the number of people who are trying to compile massive codebases and go as far as parallelizing compilation of translation units, this may be a tough pill for them to swallow. (evaluating constant expressions probably comes with a similar/worse performance hit caveat depending on how its done)Importing Declarations- This is a breaking change...one of the ways I have kind of implemented templating in C is by defining a variable and importing a c file, changing the variable, and then reimporting the same c file. Another thing I've done is define a bunch of things and then import the SQLite C Amalgamation and then add another function (I do this to expose a SQLite internal which isnt exposed via its headers). All of these use cases would break with this change.Are there any thoughts about these issues? Any ways to solve them perhaps?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write unit tests for my C code all that time. It's not difficult if you use a good build system and if you are willing to stomach some boilerplate. Here is one test from    my "test suite" for my npy library:    void
    test_load_uint8() {
        npy_arr *arr = npy_load("tests/npy/uint8.npy");
        assert(arr-&gt;n_dims == 1);
        assert(arr-&gt;dims[0] == 100);
        assert(arr-&gt;type == 'u');
        npy_free(arr);
    }
    int
    main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        PRINT_RUN(test_load_uint8);
        ...
    }

I know I could have some pre-processor generate parts of the tests, but I prefer to KISS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669637</guid></item><item><title>6.

I just re-ran that same experiment, but swapped out `gpt-4o-mini` with `phi-4`.`phi-4` really blew me away in terms of learning from few-shots. It measured as being 97% consistent with `gpt-4o` when using high-precision few-shots! Without the few-shots, it was only 37%. That's a huge improvement!By contrast, with few-shots it performs as well as `gpt-4o-mini` (though `gpt-4o-mini`'s baseline without few-shots was 59% – quite a bit higher than `phi-4`'s).[1] https://bits.logic.inc/p/getting-gpt-4o-mini-to-perform-like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone blown away by how fast we got to running something this powerful locally? I know it's easy to get burnt out on llms but this is pretty incredible.I genuinely think we're only 2 years away from full custom local voice to voice llm assistants that grow with you like JOI in BR2049 and it's going to change how we think about being human and being social, and how we grow up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s odd that MS is releasing models they are competitors to OA.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of decentralized syndication as a potential solution to improve how content is shared across the internet. It highlights the limitations of current centralized platforms, which control content distribution and user engagement, leading to issues such as censorship and lack of control over personal data. The author advocates for a new protocol that fosters decentralized communication and collaboration, enabling users to retain ownership of their content and data while encouraging a more open and resilient internet ecosystem.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to have an RSS interface where I can republish articles to a number of my own feeds (selectively or automatically). Then I can follow some my friends' republished feeds.I feel like the "one feed" approach of most social platform is not here to benefit users but to encourage doom-scrolling with FOMO. It would be a lot harder for them to get so much of users' time and tolerance for ads if it were actually organized. But it seems to me that there might not be that much work needed to turn an RSS reader into a very productive social platform for sharing news and articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While everyone is waiting for Atproto to proto, ActivityPub is already here. This is giving me "Sumerians look on in confusion as god creates world" vibes.https://theonion.com/sumerians-look-on-in-confusion-as-god-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its not obvious to me that what is missing here is another technical protocol rather than more effective 'social protocols'. If you havent noticed, the major issues of today is not the scaling of message passing per-se but the moderation of content and violations of the boundary between public and private. These issues are socially defined and cannot be delegated to (possibly algorithmic) protocols.In other words what is missing is rules, regulations and incentives that are adapted to the way people use the digital domain and enforce the decentralized exchange of digital information to stay within a consensus "desired" envelope.Providing capabilities in code and network design is ofcourse a great enabler, but drifting into technosolutionism of the bitcoin type is a dead end. Society is not a static user of technical protocols. If left without  matching social protocols any technical protocol will be exploited and fail.The example of abusive hyperscale social media should be a warning: they emerged as a behavior, they were not specified anywhere in the underlying web design. Facebook is just one website after all. Tim Berners-Lee probably did not anticipate that one endpoint would succesfully fake being the entire universe.The deeper question is, do we want the shape of digital networks to reflect the observed concentration or  real current social and economic networks or do we want to use the leverage of this new techology to shape things in a different (hopefully better) direction?The mess we are in today is not so much failure of technology as it is digital illiteracy, from the casual user all the way to the most influential legal and political roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42654891</guid></item><item><title>8.

It highlights the potential risks and dangers of implementing such backdoors, including the vulnerability to cyberattacks and exploitation by malicious actors. The piece also examines various case studies and examples where government pressures have led to weakened security measures, stressing the importance of maintaining strong encryption to protect privacy and security in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To avoid my comment being entirely a terminology nitpick I will say this is very cool work that I would be too afraid of CFAA to ever attempt. Especially funny to see four parasites on one government domain. Do skiddies not excise other skiddies' backdoors when pwning systems so they can have them all to themselves?&gt; We then hooked that up to the AWS Route53 API, and just bought them en-masse. Honestly, it’s $20, and we’ve done worse with more.&gt; We’re incredibly grateful for the support of The Shadowserver Foundation, who have agreed yet again to save us from our own adventures and to take ownership of the domains implicated in this research and sinkhole them.I wish we could collectively stop using the terms “buy” and “own” with regard to domains. Try “leased” or “rented”. If they could be bought then they wouldn't have been available again for this exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved this write up. Light-hearted. Conscious of the impact of any disclosure. Everything substantiated, but not taking themselves too seriously. Enjoying read, and at the same time talking about a serious issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what would happen if they exploited these webshells' backdoors to delete the webshells...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674455</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's perspective on scheduling calls, emphasizing the importance of setting boundaries around time management. The author prefers to communicate through written formats, such as email or messaging, to foster clearer, more organized interactions. They advocate for acknowledging the potential inefficiencies of phone calls and suggest alternatives that can lead to more productive exchanges. The key message is to prioritize efficiency and respect for one's own time, encouraging others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone needs to write the other side of the story as a small startup owner having to deal with big businesses. It should feature:- Beeing asked for demos when they could have tried your free tier/trial and you have decent doc (They always prefer that you waste your time then asking someone on thier side to review)- Being used a price/feature comparison with your enterprise competitor just so they can get a better deal on their renewal (no stupid they never intended to change)- Having to fill endless security questionnaire without being sure you can even sell to them (what you dont love filling 100+ questions at 11PM on a Friday???).- Having to deal 3-6 months with procurement, often with one or two third party software resellers which only cares if he can make its margin (hello there CDW, no I wont lower my price 15% so you can make money)- Receiving the money 60-90 days after the deal close while you struggle with cashflow and you had to provide the service (and receiving a call from my bank rep to see why my margin and CC is full).I am sure I can think of more things. That is why I will absolutely charge an arm and leg to big businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against all of the advice in the world, I'm trying to set things up to avoid basically everything described in the article. It's tricky because the truth is that a lot of the tactics work and that is why companies implement them. A lot of investors also consider that process to be best-in-class and look for it as a sign of maturity.The counter approach is:
- Make complete information available as transparently as possible and don't gate it.
- Be forthcoming about weaknesses. Don't force prospects and customers to find them.
- Ensure that when a prospect or customer does want to talk to someone, they immediately reach someone who can handle the problem or answer the question (no need for escalations.)
- Never have an AI agent call someone unless the customer specifically requests that and be sure that all AI agents immediately disclose that they are AI.
- Offer flexible e-mail list subscription options (monthly, quarterly, annually, only release notes, etc.)
- If the product is not a fit, try to offer something useful anyway such as a suggestion of another product that might be a better match for their needs.Value based pricing is one of the reasons why a lot of companies end up in these situations. Rather than setting a standard price, the company does a detailed investigation of the customer to try to find out how much value they will gain from using the product and then they set the price based on that determination. Although it maximizes revenue in theory, it is slow and invasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate and nicely written article.There's a worse angle I've seen on the same story: A different engineer, who was already running the good open source solution successfully with their team, heard the other engineer had an enterprise sales assault dumped on them, for some load of trash, and so tried to sound the alarm, but it was already out of the other engineer's hands, because upper subtrees of the org chart had already signed on with political capital (and in a couple cases, it's somehow become an express personal performance metric that they spend the company's money on this specific product).  So all alternatives are blocked, everyone has to wait the next couple months for the sale to finalize, and then another month for IT to set up the SSO and databases, and forced to migrate from working solutions to garbage.  Then eventually the contract doesn't get renewed, with appropriate face-saving for those who pushed it through, but half the people upon whom it was inflicted have already found jobs in better companies, a quarter got PIP'd or stalled careers for being sabotaged by the trash, and the remaining quarter will mostly be laid off next year.Just say NO to enterprise sales.The only thing worse than having to do enterprise sales to sell your own product, is being the employees forced to use the likely bad purchasing decisions of other enterprise sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669754</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like uv, and it's the first package manager for a while where I haven't felt like it's a minor improvement on what I'm using but ultimately something better will come out a year or two later. I'd love if we standardized on it as a community as the de facto default, especially for new folks coming in. I personally now recommend it to nearly everyone, instead of the "welllll I use poetry but pyenv works or you could use conda too"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually stay away far FAR from shiny new tools but I've been experimenting with uv and I really like it. I'm a bit bummed that it's not written in Python but other than that, it does what it says on the tin.I never liked pyenv because I really don't see the point/benefit building every new version of Python you want to use. There's a reason I don't run Gentoo or Arch anymore. I'm very happy that uv grabs pre-compiled binaries and just uses those.So far I have used it to replace poetry (which is great btw) in one of my projects. It was pretty straightforward, but the project was also fairly trivial/typical.I can't fully replace pipx with it because 'uv tool' currently assumes every Python package only has one executable. Lots of things I work with have multiple, such as Ansible and Jupyterlab. There's a bug open about it and the workarounds are not terrible, but it'd be nice if they are able to fix that soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heck, you can get even cleaner than that by using uv’s support for PEP 723’s inline script dependencies:  # /// script
  # requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "pandas",
  # ]
  # ///

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses why the Mac Mini G4 is considered the best classic Macintosh for retro gaming enthusiasts. It highlights the device's compact design, versatility, and performance capabilities that make it suitable for playing older games. The author also mentions compatibility with various software and emulators, as well as the ability to connect to modern displays. Overall, the piece emphasizes the Mac Mini G4 as a solid choice for those looking to enjoy retro gaming on a classic Macintosh system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great comprehensive article on the "why" and there are good YouTube videos on the "how." What the article is missing that makes it even better is putting an SSD in which makes it even faster of course. You can get an untested Mac mini G4 for about $60 on eBay and the rest of the parts (SSD, PATA-mSATA adapter, RAM if less than 1 GB, power adapter, any missing screws, clock battery, etc.) will run you another $60 to make the ultimate Mac OS 9 machine. If you're comfortable taking things apart and putting them back together it's not too bad.A quick tip: be sure to reset the PRAM with command-alt-p-r holding down during restart until you hear 3 chimes. Then while the machine is booting hold down command-alt-o-f and type "reset-nvram" and then "set-defaults" and then "reset-all" (all of this is in open firmware) before installing Mac OS 9 to make sure firmware is in its original state.I came across this idea of SSD upgrading and installing Mac OS 9 in April 2024 and bought three broken ones to build one for my son. [0] When the first one worked, I ended up figuring, why not just finish the other two and sell them on eBay?That led me into a hobby business. I've now cleaned, upgraded with SSDs, and sold about 70 of them. The "business" basically breaks even, so it truly is a hobby. In fact I invested so much in inventory buying 90 of them in a lot at the end of 2024 that I am negative right now. I will probably turn a slight profit in 2025. But it's fun and if you want you can buy one from me at:
https://os9.shopSorry for the self-promotion, but very relevant!0: https://x.com/davekopec/status/1795872492386398683&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The depth of this article is wonderful. The PowerPC line did have lots of good things going for it, and the Mac mini G4 is a good example of how much you can get done with modest space, power and heat.I'm still using Mac mini G4s in several places, both for Mac OS X (legacy Final Chop) and as small, low power servers running NetBSD.There are really only two drawbacks to the Mac mini G4, in my opinion:Gigabit ethernet would've been a dollar or two more? Being stuck with 100 Mbps, or around 300 Mbps if one uses a gigabit USB adapter, isn't fun.If the DIMM slot could take 2 gig DIMMs, this'd be a perfect machine. Other PowerPC Macs could take 2 gigs - heck, even the older PowerPC 604e Power Macs 9500 and 9600 could take 1.5 gigs - so being limited to 1 gig is a bit unfortunate, especially considering that 2 gig DDR DIMMs are a thing (later Xserve G5 units could take 2 gig DDR DIMMs).Still, the Mac mini G4 is the only computer aside from SBCs that I've bought brand new, and I have always been very happy with my decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 2002 TiBook[1]; it officially supports MacOS 9.2.2, but also every OS X release up to 10.5.8. I've been surprised to find that the retail copy of StarCraft that I bought in 2009 not only includes an OS X build, but also supports PowerPC![1]: https://www.rollc.at/posts/2024-07-02-tibook/I'm not sure if it can be made to run m68k apps "natively", but on the other hand you can emulate just about any classic MacOS in a modern browser[2].[2]: https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674385</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the state of internet protocol address allocation as of January 2025, focusing on the current trends in address distribution and management by various regional internet registries (RIRs). It highlights the challenges posed by IPv4 address exhaustion and the transition to IPv6. The piece emphasizes the importance of efficient address allocation for internet service providers (ISPs) and the ongoing efforts to facilitate the broader adoption of IPv6 to ensure sufficient address availability for future internet growth. Additionally, it provides statistics and analysis on address usage, availability, and the impacts of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this blog does not accurately describe how large the ipv6 address space even after accounting for it being reduced by 2^64 for the host portion of the address. If it did it would make the concerned comments about /28 ipv6 network sizes seem very misplaced.A single static ipv4 address is a /32 slice into the ipv4 space and is considered a reasonable to size give out to a single person or even a small business that asks for it. Of course larger companies and telecom operators need larger network allocations and they have gotten them for many years in the past.Now realize that if a /64 ipv6 network is the minimum size like a single ipv4 address then you see that the ipv6 address space has 2^32  /32 ipv6 networks. Now with ipv6 any technical person and acquire a entire ipv4 internet sized network in a continuous (globally routeable if you want) range.And if any sized business today can expect buy a single "class c" /24 range of ipv4 it makes sense that large global compaines get a ipv6 /20 network to run their entire network on it.For example cloudflare[1] uses 6 regional /32 networks and a /29 network for all their routing needs. Imaging trying to build cloudflare with less than 32 addresses in a single /24 ipv4 allocation.ipv6 is so large that you can just design your network without worrying about subnet size and route based on real policy or security boundaries alone. We will run out of MAC addresses before we run out of ipv6[1] https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeing the domain which screams Australian (potaroo, quoll, quokka, et al) I looked at the author's name which brought back a few memories :-)For general interest, this is (among other accolades) 2012 Internet Hall of Fame Inductee Geoff Huston https://www.internethalloffame.org/official-biography-geoff-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how the IPv4 price has pulled back 30% since early 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670468</guid></item><item><title>13.

I first published them in 2010!To those in the comments who mentioned you are just starting your own PhD: Good luck to you! And, I hope you, like I once did, find a problem that you can fall in love with for a few years.To those just finished: Congratulations! Don’t forget to keep pushing!To those many years out: You have to keep pushing too, but there can be tremendous value in starting all over again by pushing in a different direction. You have no idea what you may find between the tips of two fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I can attest that nowadays, in some fields, research has become a 'game', where:- people torture data until it yields unreproducible results;- people choose venues that maximise their chances of getting published (and pay for publication sometimes, I'm looking at you, APC);- little concern given to excellence, rigour, and impact;- the chase for a 'diploma' from a renowned institute without putting the effort;I could go on and on, but I'll stop now.Perhaps something changes, I am waiting for this to happen for some time now (10y and counting).It's a bad system but that's what we have (at the moment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm starting a PhD — essentially from tomorrow. It's a shame to see so much discouragement here, but at this point I'm no longer surprised. I also don't care because if left to my own devices I would do research anyway.In the kindest possible way: screw all of you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671512</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;In her article, Rachel discusses the concept of "lag" in the context of programming languages and development processes, emphasizing how the perception of time can differ based on various factors, such as project complexity and one's level of experience. She reflects on her own experiences with lag when learning new technologies and tools, highlighting the importance of patience and continuous learning in overcoming these challenges. By sharing her insights, she aims to encourage others to embrace the learning curve and recognize that progress can take time, often leading to deeper understanding and mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

remote filesystem syncs and cryptography problems where machines are
out of sync. My GPS wall clock is handy for adjusting NTP, but the
time it takes to scan my eyes from the wall back to the monitor.. you
really do need two stacked like she did. So I now figured to use
transparrent terminals each logged into a different host and lay them
over one another running "watch -n1 date".Would have been nice to have some more network, code and command line
examples.  You need to set up a local ntpd and need to point your
local master at that temporarily. A better utility to write would be
"timediff -s1 -s2" that takes two time servers and shows the offset. I
bet there's a way to do that in one line. Anyone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a standard "smearing" period now? For a while, Google had a 24 hour adjustment period, 12 hours on each side of the leap second, while Facebook used a shorter period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650732</guid></item><item><title>15.

I went through several rounds and was basically ghosted after the 4th with no explanation or follow up. The last interview was to write an blog post for their blog which I submitted and then didn’t hear back until continuously nagging months later. It was pretty disheartening since all of the interviews were some form of a take-home and I spent a combined total of ~10 hours or more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo on the homepage for the completion of the findMaxElement function is a good example of what is to come. Or maybe where we are at now?The six lines of Python suggested for that function can also be replaced with a simple “return max(arr)”. The suggested code works but is absolute junior level.I am terrified of what is to come. Not just horrible code but also how people who blindly “autocomplete” this code are going to stall in their skill level progress.You may score some story points but did you actually get any better at your craft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never imagined our project would make it to the HN front page on Sunday!Tabby has undergone significant development since its launch two years ago [0]. It is now a comprehensive AI developer platform featuring code completion and a codebase chat, with a team [1] / enterprise focus (SSO, Access Control, User Authentication).Tabby's adopters [2][3] have discovered that Tabby is the only platform providing a fully self-service onboarding experience as an on-prem offering.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a project called "Tiny Tapeout," which aims to make hardware design and fabrication more accessible to hobbyists. It specifically focuses on a small donut-shaped chip designed for educational purposes, highlighting the process of creating the design, the technical details involved, and the outcome of the project. The author emphasizes the potential of such initiatives to inspire more people to engage in electronics and chip design, ultimately promoting DIY hardware development and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going slightly off topic, I was interested to learn from this blog about Tiny Tapeout, the service they've used to order their custom chip design. The concept for anyone as unfamiliar with it as me is that lots of people pay a few hundred dollars each to get a small part of a chip being made, and once it's made they receive the chip ready to use with their section everyone else's, too, with a way to choose which bit gets run.I know basically nothing about chip design, and I'm wondering if anyone could tell me: is this only useful for education purposes, for example learning how to make a chip that creates a donut on a screen, or are there people using Tiny Tapeout for useful projects, too?For each of their chip runs, they publish a list of the different people's projects that got included - https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ - but it's not easy to spot which ones might be more than somebody just learning how to play with chip design.Essentially, if someone were to pick this up as a hobby, what is the most interesting thing they could make using this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yay, a1k0n!Long time since AI Challenge, I see you're dabbling into hardware too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So great to see this excellent explanation.  Have been a fan of donut.c since it first came out.  Also I'm way better at golfing js than c so it kinda feels like you wrote this just for me :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675208</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance of a simple animal guessing game created in the 1980s, which served as a precursor to modern machine learning. It highlights how this game utilized an early form of artificial intelligence by allowing players to guess animals based on their characteristics, while the system learned from mistakes and improved over time. This innovation laid the groundwork for later advances in AI, illustrating how foundational ideas in machine learning existed before the technology gained widespread popularity. The piece reflects on the evolution of AI and its roots in playful experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In two places the article states that the original game had the ability to save the updated tree ("it had the ability to save progress and load it during the next run" and "It is an amazing example... of how, even with such a simple language, ... and the ability to save new questions").The later part says the opposite - that the original implementation had "No ability to save progress" and that this is new in the C++ implementation.I can't help but wonder (also due to other language features) if the author ran the article through an AI to 'tidy up' before posting... because I've often found ChatGPT etc. to introduce changes in meaning like this, rather than just rewriting. This is not to dismiss either the article or the power of LLM's, just a curious observation :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like "Pervading Animal" (or just "Animal") from the 1970's [1].

&lt;p&gt;The article "Life in Console" by Eugene Andrienko explores the concept of using command-line interfaces (CLI) as a powerful tool for productivity and efficiency in computing. Andrienko discusses the advantages of working with consoles, including faster navigation and control over system processes compared to graphical user interfaces (GUI). He emphasizes the learning curve associated with mastering CLI tools but argues that the investment in learning can lead to significant improvements in workflow and problem-solving. The piece serves as both an introduction and a motivational piece for those looking to enhance their skills in using command-line resources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I have been using Linux since 1996 or so, and do have quite an opinionated workflow, I never could agree with this kind of ultraconservative approach to things. History never stops. Things change. Linux changes. Not every day, not every month, but every couple of years something has to go. And that's ok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found openbsd to be one of the best unix desktop systems. Which is strange as that is not something they advertise as being good at. A large part of this is familiarity with the system(surprise, if you use a system a lot, you get comfortable with it) but some of it is this subtle feeling that the developers actually use it as a daily driver, which is often not the case with many linux systems.Now there are some huge caveats to this statement, When I say unix desktop I mean fairly bare bones terminal heavy classic unix type operating environment, If you want something more like a mac or windows desktop, but don't want to use mac or windows, than a linux distro offering that is probably more suitable. But openbsd does.. ok... here as well.Most problems with the heavy wimp style desktop environments are system administration related, where they don't understand openbsd system administration. personally I prefer cli based administration tools, and get a bit agitated when I have to worry about conflicting with some unknown desktop manager app that also wants to admin the system. So this works out great for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thats a long time to spend in it. Likely stuck trying to quit vim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674153</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a Python implementation of the classic snake game, designed for educational purposes. It features a simple graphical interface and is built using the Pygame library, allowing users to see the mechanics of game development while enabling them to play and modify the game. The documentation includes setup instructions, gameplay controls, and guidance for further development, making it a useful resource for both beginners and those looking to enhance their programming skills in game design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We’re an inverted organization. That means that tactical decisions are made by the people who are doing the work, not managersI've worked at various places where this was supposedly the system.Guess who had budgets, hiring powers, went to leadership offsites? Yeah not the ICs. It usually just means the C level will smile and nod while "listening" to your feedback instead of ignoring you completelyHas anyone worked at a true inverted company where centuries of classical power structures are thrown out the window?I feel it can never be properly implemented unless in eg a cooperative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but not surprising, that Agility only made place 5, way behind Quality. It will soon be a quarter of a century since the Agile Manifesto has been published.  It would be sad if we hadn't progressed since then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that they have a programming philosophy that they want people at the company to adopt. A common problem I see at companies that don't have onboarding is that people join the team with assumptions from previous jobs but you never level set them with the company. So 12 months down the line the new guy wants to change the process and you have to repeat the same discussions about what agile means for the nth time.Amazon does a good job of training new hire on the 'Amazon way'. Amazon does 6 pagers, they do design docs. Amazon does SOA. Amazon does not use relational databases. Everything has an API. Because of the 'Amazon way' and the training they do new team members understand at least some of the context and expectations.Is it the best way? Probably not but no one knows what the best way is anyway. At least they have a way. Saves a lot of effort compared to every new hire relitigating the process and architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676123</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Rewilding the Self" explores the concept of rewilding as a means to reconnect individuals with their natural instincts and surroundings. It discusses how modern society often suppresses innate human behaviors and encourages disconnection from nature. The author advocates for practices that promote self-discovery and a deeper relationship with the environment, emphasizing the importance of mindfulness, community, and authentic experiences in fostering a more balanced and fulfilling life. Through rewilding, individuals can reclaim their true selves and enhance their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are nature. The separation between humanity and nature is a false one, that works against conservation efforts.I like the idea of rewilding because it forces us to see ourselves as part of a large natural system - which is what we are - and helps grow appreciation for that system.But until there is a way for recognition of that system to become more profitable than "othering" nature - polluting the environment, destroying parts of that system - or regulation prevents that othering, it can be depressingly isolating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My problem with the term “ecological balance” is that it doesn’t exist. It’s a mythical term that seems invented by Disney. Nature is brutal. Populations will get wiped out, species will disappear.That’s exactly why having a lot of species is important. But it’s hardly balanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the world's population now exceeding 8 billion, we need to be thoughtful about the best way to rewild ourselves. We can live in dense cities with concrete high-rises but animals can't. Many animals at the top of the food chain need significant ranges for themselves. So the challenge is finding a way that we can minimize our footprint while also providing more opportunities for legitimate connection with nature. Put another way, a bimodal life - with time split between a concrete high-rises and natural areas is probably more ideal for the overall system than a push for everyone to live in slightly more rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672758</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the prevalent issue of spam and misleading extensions on Google's Chrome Web Store, highlighting how these extensions can compromise user security and privacy. It details cases where some of these harmful extensions, despite violating store policies, have gained significant popularity and visibility, raising concerns about Google's review and moderation processes.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have two Chrome extensions in the store. They're not very popular and are really just features I wanted for my own use. I think I have less than 100 users total.At least once a week I get emails from people- offering money to add their "tracking" code- wanting to purchased the extension outrightWhat they clearly want is access to my modest install base to push questionable code onto. I certainly am not going for these offers, but I could certainly see someone less financially secure giving in to it, and that scares me a little.The idea of paid malware insertion in smaller packages is kind of troubling in general. How often just in life in general do we just trust opaque binaries to be clean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These rogue extensions are "surreptitiously monetizing web searches" - but doesn't Google conspicuously monetize web searches?So it seems the Google TOS bans competition in search monetization using their "open source" browser. Isn't it odd that an "open source" browser is apparently designed to provide a monopoly on search monetization by the nice people who give it to you for free?And being 80% or so of all searches:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-...It seems like Peter Thiel's claim that google is a search advertising monopoly masquerading as a (competitive, non-monopoly) technology company might be spot on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google would prefer to focus on limiting ad blockers with V3 instead of protecting users from these extensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640207</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This advice to quit social media is always a hit on HN. When I was 10 years younger I read the same thing on HN, was thoroughly convinced and quit social media. I even followed the advice of trying to stay in touch by email. Sure.Turns out that a lot of people I knew posted huge life updates that I completely missed out on. I asked them why they didn’t tell me and they were confused. They said the posted it on social media. I can’t speak for everyone, but I know a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely. I have a few close friends and that’s it.Maybe that’s an ok tradeoff to make, but it’s worth knowing that before getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When something is used by billions of people its kinda futile to argue about its utility. But then billions are addicted to tobacco, alcohol, drugs, gambling etc. and those benefitting from providing these "services" will do everything they can to keep people addicted while arguing that they are solving a real problem.The reality is always a mundane core that gets complicated by human tragicomedy. Ofcourse its wholesome to be able to connect digitally with friends and family. Its also a great economic enabler to connect digitally with professionals. Or to be able to publish to a bulleting board about your brilliant accomplishments.But to paraphrase Gates, we need these connections, we don't need the self-appointed universal connectors.Its 2025, and this is HN. I put it to you that technically the only thing preventing us today from having good "connections infrastructure" is the corrupting influence of big adtech. One possible vision of how to organize the digital space in technical and economic terms had become the only vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to be a producer more than a consumer. I produce videos (admittedly that are technical and dry) so it's not like I get hundreds of thousands of views.On my downtime I still participate in social media though usually anonymously in the form of shit posting. Or just watching YouTube. I did get sucked into that crap of posting everyday about my glamorous life. Eventually I found I didn't know what to post anymore. Had to find something to post. I'm glad I never got sucked into it completely like TikTok/Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677587</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer per process over the alternatives.When you write code you have the choice to do per process, per thread, or sequential.The problem is that doing multiple tests in a shared space doesn't necessarily match the world in which this code is run.Per process testing allows you to design a test that matches the usage of your codebase. Per thread already constrains you.For example: we might elect to write a job as a process that runs on demand, and the library we use has a memory leak, but it can't be fixed in reasonable time. Since we write it as a process that gets restarted we manage to constrain the behavior.Doing multiple tests in multiple threads might not work here as there is a shared space that is retained and isn't representative of real world usage.Concurrency is a feature of your software that you need to code for. So if you have multiple things happening, then that should be part of your test harness.The test harness forcing you to think of it isn't always a desirable trait.That said, I have worked on a codebase where we discovered bugs because the tests were run in parallel, in a shared space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A much better model still is a mixture.* Use multiple processes, but multiple tests per process as well.* Randomly split and order the tests on every run, to encourage catching flakiness. Print the seed for this as part of the test results for reproducibility.* Tag your tests a lot (this is one place where, as many languages provide, "test classes" or other grouping is very useful). Smoke tests should run before all other tests, and all run in one process (though still in random order). Known long-running tests should be tagged to use a dedicated process and mostly start early (longest first), except that a few cores should be reserved to work through the fast tests so they can fail early.* If you need to kill a timed-out test even though other tests are still running in the same process - just kill the process anyway, and automatically run the other tests again.* Have the harness provide fixtures like "this is a temporary directory, you don't have to worry about clearing it on failure", so tests don't have to worry about cleaning up if killed. Actually, why not just randomly kill a few tests regardless?I wrote some more about tests here [1], but I'm not sure I'll update it any more because of Github's shitty 2FA-but-only-the-inconvenience-not-the-security requirement.[1]: https://gist.github.com/o11c/ef8f0886d5967dfebc3d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nextest is one of the very small handful of tools I use dozens or hundreds of times a day. Parallelism can reduce test suite execution time significantly, depending on your project, and has saved me cumulative days of my life. The output is nicer, test filtering is nicer, leak detection is great, and the developer is friendly and responsive. Thanks sunshowers!The one thing we've had to be aware of is that the execution model means there can sometimes be differences in behaviour between nextest and cargo test. Very occasionally there are tests that fail in cargo test but succeed in nextest due to better isolation. In practice this just means that we run cargo test in CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649139</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that the "cargo cult" metaphor, commonly used to describe the adoption of superficial practices without understanding their underlying principles, is becoming outdated and counterproductive. It discusses how this metaphor often leads to dismissing innovative ideas and practices instead of fostering a deeper understanding of their significance. The author emphasizes the need for a more constructive approach in discussions about technology and methodologies, advocating for embracing new concepts rather than clinging to outdated metaphors that hinder constructive dialogue and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nah, we better abandon this kind of retroactive policing of language instead from people with nothing better to do.Nobody who uses the term "cargo cult" in a technical settings does it out of spite or even refers to specific nations or peoples. Just refers to the core takeaway of a practice which might as we be all lore.Care about politics and colonialism and injustice and what have you? There are 1000000 causes you could devote your time and make an active  difference to people actually suffering this very moment, rather than language policing tech terms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I this post has enabled me to put my finger on what makes me uncomfortable about  articles like this.Even though I frequently understand and sympathise with the goals and feelings of the writers, there are two factors that stand out.1.  A sense of certainty of the causal nature of the issues at hand.  It comes across that the author has concluded the correct course of action.2.  Everybody, including you,  should follow their concluded course of action.I would be fine with an article talking about what the cargo cult metaphor means, its historical accuracy and how the author thinks that impacts upon people.   It would then seem to be quite reasonable for them to say that they are going to cease using the metaphor because of those reasons, and to invite people to consider doing the same if they think the reasons seem valid to them.It's ok to say"I think this, so I'm going to change my behaviour"It seems unreasonable to say."I think this, so everyone should change their behaviour"Unfortunately it feels like we are heading to"I know this, so everyone should change their behaviour"The call for everyone else to change is backed by the certainty of their opinion.  It presents complainants as wanting you to do their thing not because it's their opinion,  it's because it is undeniable fact.  It places you as morally deficient if you disagree.This affects things large and small,  whether people want you to boycott a brand of toothpaste, or talk about milliBTC as the base unit of bitcoin,  or talk about the topic they are uninterested in in a different forum.    The solution is simple, everyone has to do this simple act of my bidding.Surely if the case for the damage caused by the cargo cult metaphor were to be made clearly and undeniable,  people would not need to be told to stop using it,  They just would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nope, we’re not doing this in 2025. Cargo cult succinctly expresses an important concept. We’re not catering to imaginary offenses somebody hallucinates on behalf of some supposedly marginalized people anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675025</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the Chatham House Rule, which is designed to encourage open dialogue by allowing participants to speak freely without attribution. It highlights how this principle is often applied in discussions but can inadvertently contribute to a sense of burnout among attendees who feel pressured to engage without the chance to express themselves fully. The piece emphasizes the importance of balancing open communication with the well-being of participants, suggesting that organizers should find ways to alleviate pressure and foster meaningful interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not new. Many of the mailing lists that dominated the discourse of the early Internet in the 1990s operated under a similar rule. The novelty is that it disappeared almost entirely for decades.The original purpose (on the Internet) was to create a space where complex ethical and moral questions could be explored and discussed in depth without risk of someone taking a hypothetical statement out of context to slander you, as people are wont to do. It would be orders of magnitude worse in this current age of people obsessed with generating click-bait for engagement, which wasn’t a thing back then. I personally found that environment to be intellectually stimulating and rigorous, I miss the standard of discourse of those days.Chatham House Rule is going back to the old Internet, which valued novel insight and reasoned discourse highly, before the masses took over the Internet. The purpose was not to enable edgelords. Rational defense of ideas, statements, and hypotheses was expected and table stakes. Related rules of that era, such as Crocker’s Rule[0], placed responsibility on the reader to address uncomfortable or offensive feedback in the most dispassionate way possible.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12881288&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Denunciations of the Chatham House Rule seem underdeveloped. According to the history on Wikipedia, it was invented to let members of post-WW1 English civic society discuss and debate potential reforms, and then get as much of that discussion into the public record as desired without having individual members pilloried for things they said during the discussion, even if the rest of the group disagreed with them.This doesn’t even seem unique. Newspaper editorial boards don’t assign individual names to editorials or sentences thereof. Individual members of Congressional commissions aren’t cited for the sentences they (or their staff) committed to reports.Chatham House Rule, meet Chesterton’s Fence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems pretty obvious why in a world where if you misspeak or say something ill considered it can be all over twitter and have serious personal and professional ramifications.Regardless of how well meaning people are in their desire to hold people to account for bad views, it does have a chilling effect, and you can't learn if you don't have a safe place to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669027</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the probabilities associated with token generation in large language models (LLMs). It explores how LLMs predict the next token based on context, detailing the statistical methods involved and the implications of token selection on model performance. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these probabilities for optimizing LLM applications and improving their effectiveness in various tasks. Additionally, the article potentially covers practical examples and mathematical frameworks that illustrate these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The scenario that I’m worried about, and that is playing out right now, is that they get good enough that we (or our leaders) become overconfident in their abilities and start integrating them into applications that they just aren’t ready for without a proper understanding of their limitations.Very true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The o1 example is interesting. In the CoT summary it acknowledges that the most recent official information is 1611m, but it then chooses to say 1622 because it's more commonly cited. It's like it over-thinks itself into the wrong answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bank account anchoring bias may be just the base model predicting as best as it can, as OP described earlier. Imagine a random Internet page where you read "There is V in my X. The Y of Z A, in Bs, is _." What do you expect? V, of course! Because why would a person on the Internet ever join these two factoids if they were totally unrelated (as they are in fact in this example)? That would be a gross violation of basic writing and human communication norms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42653744</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that utilizes virtualization to compartmentalize different tasks into isolated environments called qubes. This design enhances security by preventing malware or other threats from affecting the entire system. Qubes OS allows users to run various operating systems simultaneously and supports secure application management, making it particularly suitable for users with high security needs, such as developers or cybersecurity professionals. The website provides resources, documentation, and community support for both new and experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have used it for several months as my daily OS and dropped it because of bad graphics performance (only software rendering supported, many frame drops when watching HD videos on YT) and bad battery management. Due to software rendering the overall systems perfmance also dropped. So I cannot recommend it for people with high requirements on graphics and battery duration. Besides that it was an interesting and good experience.I think it would be good to make it possible to deactivate certain security features such as strict graphics isolation so that users can adjust their settings to their risk acceptance level. It would also be interesting to be able to optionally replace Xen with lighter isolation mechanisms, even if the user would compromise on security here too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We wouldn't have to rely on security by hypervisor if linux had proper security measures, sandboxing and access controls OOTB. Qubes is still far from good although it's slowly getting there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though I never used Qubes OS I used to really enjoy Joanna Rutkowska's passion for it.Other women who's computing enthusiasm I enjoyed was Jessie Frazelle's writing and speaking about running everything in Docker on her laptop and Sacha Chua's love for Emacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677608</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent decision by Matt Mullenweg to shut down the WordPress Sustainability Team, which has sparked significant backlash within the WordPress community. Critics argue that this move undermines efforts to make the platform more environmentally friendly and threatens the broader mission of promoting sustainable practices. The article highlights various responses from community members who are disappointed with the decision and emphasizes concerns over the future of sustainability initiatives within WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a piece yesterday about the recent WordPress drama, including this bit. A fun thing I learned while digging into it is that Mullenweg himself requested that the Slack channel for this team be set up live on stage at WordCamp Europe in 2022. When disbanding the team, Mullenweg said, “today I learned that we have a sustainability team”. Maybe he forgot, but setting up this team was — at least in part — his idea.https://anderegg.ca/2025/01/11/wordpress-is-in-trouble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't really understand what a "WP Sustainability Team" was, so I clicked the link to the linked website in this story. I was surprised that it was in fact an initiative to do things like "have a dashboard that shows the climate impact of publishing" and "promote static publishing over..." I assume because serving this content (under someone's model) uses less electricity?Hey - if this is important to you, by all means pursue this direction, but I would cut this sort of initiative too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher has described Matt Mullenweg’s move to shut down WordPress’s sustainability team as “bizarrely heinous behavior.”Is it bizarrely heinous? Or is it just kind of bad? I enjoy WordPress drama, and run a couple of lazy WordPress services, but I don't think that this is actually worth all the spilt ink and tears, relative to all the other injustices a person might choose to concern themselves with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672675</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Microsoft Bob, an early attempt by Microsoft to create a user-friendly graphical interface for Windows in the mid-1990s. Aimed at non-technical users, Bob featured a cartoonish design and a simple layout with an emphasis on ease of use. However, it faced significant criticism for being overly simplistic and not meeting the needs of its target audience, which contributed to its poor sales and eventual discontinuation. The article positions Microsoft Bob as one of the company's most notable product failures, highlighting its ambitious intent overshadowed by its execution shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676928"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft never really left the dream of creating Bob behind. If you look at their Virtual Reality Portal it is basically a modern version of Bob where you start in a livingroom and need to go into into other rooms to perform certain task. To start apps you eg. need to pick them from a book shelf. Essential the same a Bob.A few images for reference. Notice that you start MS Paint same way in the VR portal and Bob.VR Portal:
https://onewindows.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/windows-mix...Bob: https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/upl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had Bob in an attempt to make my technophobic mother capable of using the computer.My main memory of it was that it allowed you to add shortcuts to other installed programs, so I added the few games on the computer to Bob. This used way too many resources, causing Bob to crash and me being unable to get into my profile to fix it. It may have broken the program for anyone else using it too, I can't recall. Relatively standard behavior crashing the program far beyond their target market's ability to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimmed it quickly and saw it taught Racket to teach programming design.I've worked at a coding bootcamp in 2017. And I have to say, I was a bit jealous. Where I was learning through methods at university that were a bit quaint, my students learned JS with the latest frameworks. And sure, you can argue whether the length of 3 months is enough, but they were surely getting a better education. What they learned in 3 months, took me at least 6 months to a year in terms of how useful it is.The thing is, especially as a beginner, learning any programming language will give you similar difficulties (glossing over some nuances). So why not just learn a practical one?I think once a student has had a practical programming course under their belt, only after that should more esoteric languages come to showcase certain concepts. I believe that they'd be more motivated to learn them as they're more into the groove of programming.And this is coming from someone that has programmed 2 years in Pharo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676928</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the famous wager between economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich regarding the future availability of natural resources and the impact of population growth on scarcity. Simon argued that human ingenuity and technological advancements would lead to resource abundance, while Ehrlich maintained that growing populations would deplete resources. The outcome of the bet, which focused on the prices of specific metals over a decade, ultimately favored Simon, illustrating the resilience of supply in the face of increasing demand and highlighting the role of innovation in resource management. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding population dynamics and resource distribution in addressing environmental and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not Paul Ehrlich's worse prediction. His most infamous was that "hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death" in the 1970s[0]. It’s curious how he managed to remain influential despite a track record of such inaccurate forecasts.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich#The_Population...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;| If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000I would love to know what it was about England that meant it's end was nigh, I mean what about France, Norway or Belgium ?Also, when he said "England" was he actually referring to the United Kingdom (as Americans often are) or were Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland going to be spared in some way ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's only one core problem in AI worth solving for most startups building AI powered software: context.No matter how good the AI gets, it can't answer about what it doesn't know.  It can't perform a process for which it doesn't know the steps or the rules.No LLM is going to know enough about some new drug in a pharma's pipeline, for example, because it doesn't know about the internal resources spread across multiple systems in an enterprise.  (And if you've ever done a systems integration in any sufficiently large enterprise, you know that this is a "people problem" and usually not a technical problem).I think the startups that succeed will understand that it all comes down to classic ETL: identify the source data, understand how to navigate systems integration, pre-process and organize the knowledge, train or fine-tune a model or have the right retrieval model to provide the context.There's fundamentally no other way.  AI is not magic; it can't know about trial ID 1354.006 except for what it was trained on and what it can search for.  Even coding assistants like Cursor are really solving a problem of  ETL/context and will always be.  The code generation is the smaller part; getting it right requires providing the appropriate context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this argument only makes sense if you believe that AGI and/or unbounded AI agents are "right around the corner".  For sure, we will progress in that direction, but when and if we truly get there–who knows?If you believe, as I do, that these things are a lot further off than some people assume, I think there's plenty of time to build a successful business solving domain-specific workflows in the meantime, and eventually adapting the product as more general technology becomes available.Let's say 25 years ago you had the idea to build a product that can now be solved more generally with LLMs–let's say a really effective spam filter.  Even knowing what you know now, would it have been right at the time to say, "Nah, don't build that business, it will eventually be solved with some new technology?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one thing ignored here is the value of UX.If a general AI model is a "drop-in remote worker", then UX matters not at all, of course. I would interact with such a system in the same way I would one of my colleagues and I would also give a high level of trust to such a system.If the system still requires human supervision or works to augment a human worker's work (rather than replace it), then a specific tailored user interface can be very valuable, even if the product is mostly just a wrapper of an off-the-shelf model.After all, many SaaS products could be built on top of a general CRM or ERP, yet we often find a vertical-focused UX has a lot to offer. You can see this in the AI space with a product like Julius.The article seems to assume that most of the value brought by AI startups right now is adding domain-specific reliability, but I think there's plenty of room to build great experiences atop general models that will bring enduring value.If and when we reach AGI (the drop-in remote worker referenced in the article), then I personally don't see how the vast majorities of companies - software and others - are relevant at all. That just seems like a different discussion, not one of business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672790</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! A couple gameplay suggestions I would have is that while the game does pretty well figuring out which word I'm typing sometimes I will get "locked" on a word that I decide I don't actually want to complete (for example, if something is coming at me faster). And, while probably intentional, sometimes I just can't see words or there is some delay in when they actually get destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games like this based on an existing skill would really benefit from the ability to start at higher levels. I'm a pretty proficient typist, it'd be a lot more interesting to me if there was any risk at all of me failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The game doesn't penalize wrong key presses. I made an automation cheat for it back in Dec 2013!    import java.awt.*;
    
    public class autokey {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            // Give the user time to switch windows
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            
            // Repeatedly type the letters A through Z until the mouse is moved
            Robot rob = new Robot();
            Point prevLoc = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
            while (MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation().equals(prevLoc)) {
                for (int i = 'A'; i &lt;= 'Z'; i++) {
                    rob.keyPress(i);
                    Thread.sleep(1);
                }
                Thread.sleep(50);
            }
        }

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of invariants in programming, providing a detailed explanation of their importance in ensuring the correctness and reliability of algorithms. It clarifies what invariants are—conditions that remain true during the execution of a program or a portion of it—and discusses various types of invariants, such as loop invariants and class invariants. The author emphasizes the role of invariants in facilitating reasoning about code behavior, aids in debugging, and contributes to effective software design by promoting a clear understanding of how data and states are maintained throughout the program's lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure that I agree with the article.In the course of my work, I think of an invariant as a state that must hold true at all points during the software’s execution.For example, “port xxx must never accept inbound traffic”.I don’t think of invariants as mindsets; I think of them as runtime requirements that are observable and testable at any point during execution, and whose violation is an indication that some assumption about state that the proper execution of the software depends on, no longer holds.Maybe a good analogy would be “a runtime assert”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that the Ada language features baked-in pre- and post-condition invariants as a part of a function's signature. It goes beyond just runtime assertions by becoming a part of the function's contract with callers.https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/cont...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another way to view such invariant is to see it as a generalization of both pre-  as well as post-condition.The pre-condition is a special case, then the invariant provides the "guard rails" along which the computation proceeds, and then the post-condition is again a special case which ultimately is the result of the computation.In the search example of the computation, the pre-condition is "the position is somewhere in the allowed indices", the post-condition is "the return value is the position". The stated invariant is "the value is between current min and max bounds". These bounds become tighter and tighter, so that eventually the pre-condition is transformed into the post-condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640178</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a phone with a limited version of Android (Android Go) and only 2GB of RAM which isn't enough. It has a slow CPU, it lacks 5G connectivity which is more and more important just to have good reception. It comes with at most 2 years of security updates. It has 32GB of storage which quickly fill up if you take pictures every now and then.If you can afford it, get something like the Samsung A52 5G with 7 years of updates and 6GB or 8GB of RAM. If that's too expensive, get one from the list when it's on sale: https://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=umtsover&amp;v=e&amp;hloc=uk&amp;sort=p&amp;bl1...These are recently released phones with 6GB RAM or more and Android 14+ starting at £99. 6GB of RAM means you can use your phone for a couple of years without it getting super slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the issue with these low end devices are that the duopoly on operating systems makes it impossible to develop a competing operating system that get's any traction.I am 100% sure you, as a manufacturer, could develop a very lightweight shim over a linux or BSD kernel that has significantly better performance than Android does. It would however be a universal flop regardless of how useable it is since critical apps like WhatsApp/Telegram/banking would not get ported to that platform ever.That effectively leaves you with needing a capable web browser and well... Even Firefox with every form of adblocker enable regularly chews up 2-3 GB of ram for me, at least on desktop. And building a competitive web browser to Chromium is an absurd endeavour for a cheap cell manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HMD is a mobile phone brand; "Key" is a line of phones.I thought it was something like a YubiKey, but it appears instead to be a really cheap phone running Android Go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673090</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Working for Americans" by Sean Goedecke emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs and welfare of American citizens in policy-making and governance. It outlines strategies for improving economic opportunities, enhancing social services, and fostering community engagement to ensure that government actions directly benefit the populace. Goedecke advocates for transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in government decisions, arguing that a focus on American interests will lead to a stronger and more unified nation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am Brazilian-Australian, worked for a few years in Australia and then moved to Sweden and worked for an American company here.The company was Swedish, but was eventually acquired by an American corporation.One of the projects we were working on started getting delayed due to endless discussions about which tech to use and how to architect things (the companies used completely different stacks) so we could integrate everything. One day, we had a video call with one big Manager from Florida. The guy just started shouting like a maniac and treated everyone, including us and his American team, like crap.That was so incredibly surreal to everyone on our side, as even the tiniest raising of your voice in our office would've been extremely unusual, and Swedes are one of the most conflict-avoiding people you can find anywhere. After the call was over, everyone was all thinking like "what the fuck just happened" but no one said much at all... we just  kind of pretended that did not happen and slowly went back to playing some ping pong and calmly sitting at our desks and doing some work with headphones on.After a few months, only I was left on the team as everyone just found elsewhere to work.... I followed a couple of months after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an additional issue with timezones I'm surprised he didn't mention - you're off by a day. This means nobody is around on your Monday because it's US Sunday and conversely US Friday is your Saturday morning. This means you either need to adapt to having 4 days a week of overlap, or you need to shift your life to accomodate 7am meetings on a Saturday morning.There's also regular chaos with the mis-matched DST windows meaning meetings will swing about by 1-2 hours multiple times as the seasons change depending on whose calendar created them, it's manageable but inevitably there's misses and confusion or someone's 8am suddenly becomes a 6am without rescheduling.The bigger issue however is if you're the AU leg of a global firm with a US plurality: If there are teams in the UK or EU for example there's simply no way of operating with overlap that doesn't involve someone regularly having meetings in the deeply inhospitable early hours of the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one.In some sense this also fits under culture. The Australian government has historically been fairly technophobic (they really have a thing against privacy - the ban on effective encryption springs to mind, they've tried to ban Monero too but that doesn't work because crypto is too slippery). I also vaguely recall from years ago that we make it hard to use equity as a significant part of employee compensation. Overall Australia lacks the free-wheeling spirit of letting people do things that works so well in tech so I assume there are a lot of other small barriers I don't know about (eg, I'd bet companies like Uber would have been killed in the crib if it started in Australia). We also have a subtly anti-cheap-energy policy that must make life hard for data centres.We've produced some big tech success stories like Atlassian but when you combine dubious regulation with the larger US capital markets there isn't really much to recommend about Australia. I wouldn't suggest putting money into the Australian tech scene and the market has probably sniffed that out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669681</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Case for Letting Malibu Burn" argues that the natural cycle of wildfires is an essential aspect of California's ecosystem, particularly in areas like Malibu, where human intervention has increased fire risks and altered the landscape. It discusses the historical relationship between fire and the region's ecology, suggesting that allowing certain areas to burn can promote ecological health and prevent more destructive wildfires in the future. The piece also addresses the complex issues of property rights, environmental policy, and the increasing threat of climate change, calling for a reevaluation of fire management practices to prioritize ecological resilience over human development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; So why do people insist on rebuilding in the firebelt?Why do Floridians keep rebuilding in the wake of endless hurricanes? Why do folks live in Tornado Alley? Why do Dakotans endure one tragic winter after another? Why did New Orleans build back after yhe flooding?Man seeks to tame nature - to bend it to our will. Plus we'll take "build now, great views now" over "possible disaster later ".One could argue that nowhere is completely risk free, but it seems like the homing instinct (Plus the cultural instinct to build out of wood) is strong.It might be time to consider alternate building methods suitable for the risk of the area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So instead of a long-overdue debate about the wisdom of rebuilding and the need to prevent further construction in areas of extreme natural fire danger, public attention was diverted into a discussion of the best methods for clearing vegetation (rototillers or goats?) and making homes fire-resistant.Does anyone honestly think that debate has any actual chance of hapenning, even now? Malibu and the Pacific Palisades are some of the best real estate in the state if not the country. There’s always going to be someone willing to pay the rising cost of fire insurance and take the risk to live there. Short of the state buying out all the property owners or making that area uninsurable by CalFAIR, people are going to build. Not to mention the political connections they have.Altadena, on the other hand, was built where and how it was built because of segregationist redlining in Pasadena and South Pasadena. It’s a historically minority neighborhood that was only built so densely with so little fire protection because they couldn’t afford it and the state never gave them much help. It looks like once again our power companies are responsible for starting a destructive conflagration because they siphoned maintenance money to shareholders and executives (many of whom probably live in Malibu or the Palisades). Any state policy that tries to solve the Malibu/Palisades problem is going to disproportionately screw these low income communities that have built out around the edges. I’m betting that entire neighborhood will sell out to real estate developers building apartment complexes that can afford more expensive fire mitigations, destroying a historical community as much as any freeway and opening the door to tenement fires.This has all happened before and will happen again. I don’t really see a holistic solution that has any chance of passing public scrutiny and working, other than chipping away at the insurance regulator and CalFAIR, which will screw over the most vulnerable and entrench the real estate NIMBYs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It certainly feels like the need for climate change adaptation that's been foretold for years is starting to happen. There’s quite a bit of blame being thrown around regarding details like how much water was in the reservoir and the DEI stance of the fire chief, but does any of that really provide a sustainable solution?Maybe it’s time to confront the fact that people can’t continue to live in those areas without substantial changes in the build environment.The tragic reality of climate change is that despite well informed and well meaning people, no one actually wants to meaningfully change their own lifestyle to adjust to the consequences. Clear cutting trees for instance, can be a preventative measure, but I'm sure home owners in the area would protest the environmental impact, the loss of privacy, the change in their lifestyle.California has always been a state that, on paper, acknowledges the severity  of climate change, but thus far, has been fighting tooth and nail to keep homes in wildfire prone areas. What I worry about is that California chooses to create a public option for homeowners insurance that is tax payer funded to subsidize at risk homes, increasing costs for everyone else. To me this would just be another form of climate change denial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675274</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why you wouldn't deploy a spar horizontally, filled with dry ballast powder evenly along it's length, then tip it vertical once in position and pump in water to set the ballast. This seems an obvious approach, allowing use of a shallow dock ,so there must be some issue with it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this works, then why is tidal power not more widely used?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the designs presented for floating  oceanic wind turbine bases shows, that there is a need to have as much stability as possible, while
moving in response to wave action and tides.By default, all power generating equipment is 100% duty cycle , 24/7/365. For fixed land based machines the various loads and environmental wear
conditions are more or less predictable. Marine instalations on the other hand, are notorious for destroying anything and everything, very especialy
anything with moving parts, due to all of the land based factors, plus operating on an unpredictable moving platform.
 Total failure of the entire structure can be initiated by the failure of any one of many bearings/joints where movement between components takes place,deep underwater.
 Inspection becomes a challenge and service at sea impossible.
 The many failures of underwater tidal generators
bears testimony to the dificulties and challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655207</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a group of physicists advocating for a re-evaluation of the concept of dark energy, which is currently used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. They propose that instead of assuming the existence of dark energy, we should consider alternative theories of gravity that could potentially account for observational data without invoking this elusive substance. The physicists argue that by exploring these alternative frameworks, we might gain a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and the nature of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

They are sort of the default solution to a set of problems that exist in cosmology. In a sense, every physicist wants to ditch dark matter or dark energy (or at least our current understandings of them), but they just don't know what to replace them with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the better nautilus articles I’ve read, usually they’re unreadable and boring, despite an interesting title. Unsurprising that it was written by Sabine Hossenfelder. Good science communication is a real skill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every science documentary I've watched tells me most physicists want to ditch "dark energy" because it's a placeholder term for something we still don't understand yet.  Map-makers didn't actually believe there were dragons after all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672752</guid></item><item><title>46.

- it is annoying to have the "category" required to create a task. Maybe you could create a task with an "undefined" category if none provided?
- a great feature would be to be able to export the result output or view in a PNG picture or SVG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's really nice, such a good idea.Over the last 15 years the browser has become more and more of an application delivery platform, and that notion has caused SaaS to run basically everything.I realised this not too long ago, and incidentally it was due to gantt software.We, like everyone it seems, use Jira for issue tracking, but the actual roadmapping of resources and dependencies leaves a lot to be desired, tools like Microsoft Project are not only prohibitively expensive- they also don't work on MacOS.Similar issues can be levied at Omnigraph.Only SaaS tools like "InstaGantt" seem to fit the bill of cross-platform, lightweight and reasonably cost effective.Note: I'm currently not using Instagantt, despite it being the closest to good I could find, because I dislike subscriptions. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me a little bit of https://markwhen.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been programming some CAD algorithms during the last two months and found myself buying cheap pens for a cheap plotter (a Silhouette machine), to make geometric diagrams. Can't say that the process is more efficient than a color printer[^1], but it is way cheaper than those damn color toners and the profit-maximizing ways the printer accounts for its consumption. And the pen strokes on paper look cool, and one can chose different pens to draw different layers in the diagrams.[^1]: Though, in truth, the plotter is extremely reliable and fast. Inkjet printers on the other hand have a lengthy warmup and drivers are finicky to the point one imagines they constantly are on the lookout for new ways to botch a job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used a standard Lamy fountain pen for 11 years in school, and later several higher-end products (ball pens and fountain pens). But a few years ago I discovered that I really like writing with the Bic Cristal [0]. It's reliable and writing feels very smooth (even better than with some Lamy products I own). I also like that it has exactly the same shape as a classic pencil. Of course it is also very relaxing to know I can get a pack of 50 for 14 EUR. You can gnaw away on it, roll over it accidentally with you chair, lose it, break it in half - doesn't matter, because you can easily afford to have 20 of these on your desk at any time.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had quite a few nice pens over the years. For me, Lamy Safari with its triangular grip is peak ergonomics, and its price-per-usability is fantastic. I tend to have a claw-like grip, and the Safari forces me to hold it in a way that my hand doesn't cramp after 3 minutes. It's great. I love it.But for quick jotting, like making shopping lists or bullet journal notetaking, I'm on board with this list's top ballpoint pick, the Uni Jetstream. If all ballpoints were this smooth and pleasant to use, I never would've bothered investigating fountain pens. I think they're fantastic, supremely reasonably priced, and rugged enough to lose in the bottom of a bag without leaking all over stuff.I love my Safaris, but when I need to jot something down, I reach for the Jetstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676274</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say that I think the photo without the Ligthroom processing actually looks better. The second one hasn't just added a bitcoin, it has also added the "AI shimmer" that seems to be a part of a lot of generated images. I can't put my finger on exactly what the characteristic is, but my first instinct (separate from the bitcoin, which was hard to find) is "that's an AI picture." Someone should just spend some time in the blur tool if they don't like those glints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you zoom in and squint your eyes, it does look like some kind of shiny coin.What I'd like to know though... is how is the model so bad that when you tell it to "remove this artifact" ... instead of it looking at the surroundings and painting over with some DoF-ed out ocean... it slaps an even more distinct artifact in there? Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently this isn't an isolated incident: https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/1e5nyt7/generati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670132</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Whonix is a privacy-focused operating system designed to ensure anonymity while using the internet. It operates on the principle of isolation, utilizing two virtual machines: one to run applications (Workstation) and another to route internet traffic through the Tor network (Gateway). This architecture prevents potential IP address leaks and enhances user security. The Whonix website offers resources, documentation, and guides for installation and usage, emphasizing the importance of maintaining digital privacy and anonymity in an increasingly surveilled online environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experiences with consistently high CPU usage on their Chumby 8 device and details the process of upgrading its kernel as part of an ongoing series. It outlines the potential causes for the 100% CPU usage, including software inefficiencies and background processes, and shares insights into the specific changes made during the upgrade. Ultimately, the piece aims to help readers understand performance issues in similar devices and encourages exploration of kernel modifications for improved functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An old manager of mine once spent the day trying to kill a process that was running at 99% on Windows box.When I finally got round to see what he was doing I was disappointed to find he was attempting to kill the 'system idle' process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't feel like reading 4 times is necessarily a portable solution, if there will be more versions at different speeds and different I/O architectures; or how this will work under more load, and whether the original change was done to fix some other performance problem OP is not aware of, but not sure what else can be done.  Unfortunately many vendors like Marvell can seriously under-document crucial features like this.  If anything it would be good to put some of this info in the comment itself, not very elegant but how else practically are we meant to keep track of this, is the mailing list part of the documentation?Doesn't look like there's a lot of discussion on the mailing list, but I don't know if I'm reading the thread view correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the late 1990's I worked in a company that had a couple mainframes in their fleet and once I looked into a resource usage screen (Omegamon, perhaps? Is it that old?) and noticed the CPU was pegged at 100%. I asked the operator if that was normal. His answer was "Of course. We paid for that CPU, might as well use it". Funny though that mainframes are designed for that - most, if not all, non-application work is offloaded to other processors in the system so that the CPU can run applications as fast as it can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649862</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Debugging: Twenty Ourths Explained" by David A. Wheeler explores common misconceptions about debugging software. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the debugging process beyond just fixing code, highlighting that debugging often involves complex problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The text dispels twenty myths related to debugging, such as the belief that debugging can be automated, that experience is the main predictor of debugging success, and that debugging is merely the responsibility of testers. By addressing these myths, the article seeks to improve understanding of debugging's true nature and encourage better practices in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, the most pernicious temptation is to take the buggy, non-working code you have now and to try to modify it with "fixes" until the code works. In my experience, you often cannot get broken code to become working code because there are too many possible changes to make. In my view, it is much easier to break working code than it is to fix broken code.Suppose you have a complete chain of N Christmas lights and they do not work when turned on. The temptation is to go through all the lights and to substitute in a single working light until you identify the non-working light.But suppose there are multiple non-working lights? You'll never find the error with this approach. Instead, you need to start with the minimal working approach -- possibly just a single light (if your Christmas lights work that way), adding more lights until you hit an error. In fact, the best case is if you have a broken string of lights and a similar but working string of lights! Then you can easily swap a test bulb out of the broken string and into the working chain until you find all the bad bulbs in the broken string.Starting with a minimal working example is the best way to fix a bug I have found. And you will find you resist this because you believe that you are close and it is too time-consuming to start from scratch. In practice, it tends to be a real time-saver, not the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule 0: Don't panicReally, that's important. You need to think clearly, deadlines and angry customers are a distraction. That's also when having a good manager who can trust you is important, his job is to shield you from all that so that you can devote all of your attention to solving the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For #4 (divide and conquer), I've found `git bisect` helps a lot. If you have a known good commit and one of dozens or hundreds of commits after that is bad, this can help you identify the bad commit / code in a few steps.Here's a walk through on using it: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/using-git-bisect-to-help-find...I jumped into a pretty big unknown code base in a live consulting call and we found the problem pretty quickly using this method. Without that, the scope of where things could be broken was too big given the context (unfamiliar code base, multiple people working on it, only able to chat with 1 developer on the project, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682602</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the techniques used in older films to create dramatic car crashes and destruction. It highlights methods like using lightweight materials, rigged cars, and specialized props that would break or fall apart on impact. The community provides insights into specific movies and their stunts, exploring the behind-the-scenes craftsmanship that contributed to the iconic scenes. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the creative approaches filmmakers employed to ensure thrilling visual effects while maintaining safety on set.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I immediately assumed this article was about the French movie Le Corniaud (1965) in which a 2CV falls apart in 250 pieces in an accident—this scene specifically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnLj5Xo4zBc&amp;t=19s It became one of the most iconic scene of French comedy movies. To prepare the scene, the special effects engineer sawed off the car in 250 pieces, reattached every piece with hooks, and secured the hooks with "explosive bolts". At the right moment, the actor driving the car pushed a button to trigger the (tiny) explosives which made the car fall apart. Here is a French article about it: https://2cv-legende.com/expo-de-la-2cv-du-film-le-corniaud-a...PS: the French wikipedia article on the movie has a picture of the explosive bolts they used: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corniaud#L'accident_de_la_2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don't know, Keaton was amazingly dedicated as a comedic stuntman - a silent era Jackie Chan (he was less popular after the silent era, but kept working until his death in the 60s).From Wikipedia: Garry Moore recalled, "I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you.' He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it—it hurt—but you had to care enough not to care." This would have been in about 1955, when Keaton (born 1899) was an old man and well past his heyday of really dangerous stunts (he once broke his neck during an early stunt).And he usually had an amazing commitment to film in a lot of other ways. The first time he was shot in a film he took a camera apart to figure out how it worked, because he really cared about every detail (though in the middle of his career this really hurt him, as execs wanted to just trot him up in front of the camera as a high paid celebrity - they didn't want him wasting his valuable time fussing over details, or risk their investment letting him do stunts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those reasons seem to make sense but I'd say just as much has to do with Buster Keaton himself, he had nerves of steel.During the filming of the Civil War movie The General there are images of Keaton doing things that even the bravest of stuntmen wouldn't do these days and we'd now rely on film animation and tricks to make the scenes work.For instance, Keaton—who obviously was very fit and agile—is filmed sitting on a cowcatcher of a moving locomotive whilst removing rail ties that were placed on the line to impede the train's progress and then tossing them aside.I read somewhere that Clyde Bruckman the film's director gave instructions to the cameraman "to keep filming the scene until finished or until Keaton is killed" or words to that effect.I can't remember whether Bruckman was referring to this scene or another such as when he's running across the locomotive's tender (the comment could equally have applied to many other scenes I reckon). Others who are more knowledgeable could perhaps fill in the details.I like this movie, Keaton was a
great performer and his movies are a testament to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679127</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Paul Graham discusses the concept of "wokeness," critiquing its impact on society, particularly in relation to free speech, creativity, and the startup culture. Graham argues that the rise of wokeness leads to a culture of fear and self-censorship, stifling open discourse and innovation. He highlights how this movement can be counterproductive, as it often targets individuals for their views rather than fostering genuine debate and understanding. Graham ultimately advocates for a more tolerant approach that encourages diverse perspectives and real conversations rather than conformity to ideological norms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the word “woke” means very different things to some people.As an example I think people from the American political left to somewhere(?) in the middle see it as what it has been introduced as, that being looking past the status quo and instead looking at your own values, i.e. the morality of homelessness and not having a disdain for them but empathy for them instead.and then on the other side it feels like the people on the American political right see it as what this website describes it as “ A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others.”I think the divide has originated from taking unlikeable behaviour and labeling that as ‘woke’ (in bad faith of course) and some people have just bonded to that definition so much that they see it as that.At least that’s what I’ve noticed online over the past few (bonkers) years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Imagine having to explain to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the phrase "people of color" is considered particularly enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. [...] There are no underlying principles.To understand much of our language, Gnorts would have to already be aware that our words and symbols gain meaning from how they're used, and you couldn't, for instance, determine that a swastika is offensive (in the west) by its shape alone.In this case, the term "colored people" gained racist connotations from its history of being used for discrimination and segregation - and avoiding it for that reason is the primary principle at play. There's also the secondary/less universal principle of preferring "person-first language".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to political correctness was precisely that — they were student movements. They didn't have any real power.

I don't know what Graham thinks 'political correctness' would have looked like in the 1960s – most Americans still thought women's lib was a joke, many Americans were fighting to preserve segregation, and nobody had heard of such a thing as a gay rights movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682305</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses standard patterns observed in choice-based games, focusing on how players make decisions that can affect gameplay and narrative outcome. It examines the mechanics of choice in games, highlighting the significance of player agency and the influence of design on player behavior. The author analyzes specific examples from various games to illustrate these patterns and emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics for both game design and player experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. I've been a game dev for about 30 years, much of which I've spent working with narrative design/writing teams. One thing I've learned to watch out for, especially among junior designers, is what the author labels the "Time Cave."Narrative branching, done well, is fantastic—it gives the player agency and lets them make the story their own (as it were). But when you're creating the story graph, it's easy to get lost in it and lavish care on one path at the exclusion of the others. You can easily end up with one or two long, greatly-detailed paths, and (because dev time is finine, and you need to move on to writing other parts of the game) a pile of other paths that are shorter and less interesting. If the player takes one of the shorter ones, they end up missing out on all your coolest stuff. The tools I would design for the kinds of games I created specifically made it easy to create a main story trunk with side paths (that rejoined the trunk), and more difficult to branch/loop/etc.Of course, that's not the only (or even the best) way to do narrative design—Disco Elysium is a masterwork because it did the branching, merching, loops, jumps, random checks, and so forth, so well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always nice to share: the Grim Fandango Puzzle Document (pdf): http://gameshelf.jmac.org/2008/11/13/GrimPuzzleDoc_small.pdfPerfect example of the "Branch and Bottleneck".It even includes similar graphics at the start of each act.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fun, and holds true in the creative writing group I run. We use a website I programmed that helps us collaborate on writing branching fiction. We have a mapping utility that creates graphs like in the article, except more animated (d3.js, elkjs).As different authors can start their own new stories, one thing I often have to deal with is that they want to design their story to have both long path lengths (multiple chapters before an ending), and also high choice count. Those of you who know something about geometric series know that this causes problems. I often have to tell them they can't have everything they want, which causes minor drama. :)As a result, one of our stories basically shot its "choice budget" in the first few chapters, leading to many linear paths in the latter parts of the narratives, which is fun in its own way.Another of our stories has just started playing with the "gauntlet pattern" as the article describes. For this one, we decided that all chapters must be in the "same universe", just following different characters' perspectives, and are planning for certain "anchor chapters" where all characters come together for a meeting. Probably the detective questioning them as a group (it's a murder mystery).All of our stories are supposed to be literary, so usually in third person, sometimes first, never the second-person. So we don't tend to use choices and chapters as directions and rooms; it's all about how the plot moves. We also don't track state; they're designed to be able to be printed as books people can page through.Overall a super-fun project for me and a handful of other writers, it's been a consistent way to spend a few hours of fun each week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "root access" in the context of technology and computing, emphasizing the importance of users having control over their own devices and software. It argues for the right to root access as a fundamental aspect of digital autonomy and security, allowing users to customize and optimize their systems to meet personal needs. The piece highlights the implications of denying root access, such as increased vulnerability to security breaches and reliance on manufacturers for updates and support. Overall, it advocates for greater transparency and user empowerment in digital environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a ton of products on the market that are vastly more dangerous than computers: guns, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, chainsaws, table saws, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food. Yes, consumers do sometimes harm themselves by using these products. That's the price of freedom. I think it's bizarre that we treat computers as the most dangerous products in the world that for some reason demand paternalism, when none of these other products are locked down by the vendor.The reason that computers are locked down by the vendors is not that computers are somehow more dangerous than other things we buy. The reason is simply that it's technically possible to lock down computers, and vendors have found that it's massively, MASSIVELY profitable to do so. It's all about protecting their profits, not protecting us. We know that the crApp Store is full of scams that steal literally millions of dollars from consumers, and we know that the computer vendors violate our privacy by phoning home with "analytics" covering everything we do on the devices. This is not intended for our benefit but rather for theirs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP here. Really glad to see others engaging with this topic, I wrote up this post because I felt like there wasn't anything out there that was advocating for unlocked hardware as part of the discussion on "right to repair".As someone that works in security, I fully understand the need for sane defaults that protect the average user. I even advocate in the article that we should keep these defaults in place for the most part.What I tend to not understand is the argument that there should be no option for more enterprising users to access their hardware at the lowest levels because we need to protect the average consumer. It may be a footgun for some, but that's sort of the point. I expect to be able to modify something I own, whether it's to my detriment or not.My argument isn't that root access should be the default, but at the very least it should be an option. I just don't think it's right that we've normalized corporations blocking the ability to load / inspect software, which often is marketed as a safety or privacy thing, but is arguably more a business decision meant to protect profit margins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I detest Google, but I do think they made the right call with Android devices and Chromebooks. You can unlock either as long as you are willing to totally wipe the device first and start over as a new device under a new security context.This removes the risk of this being abused to compromise the data of stolen devices or evil maid attacks unless a user that knows what they are doing has explicitly opted themselves into that risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677835</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the wiki -- I have always been interested in hardware hacking but I have always felt overwhelmed as I didn't know where to start. I believe this kind of resource can greatly help with that, especially the case studies.However, I can't help but feel that a major part of the content is LLM-generated, or at least LLM-rewritten. It feels off and uninteresting to read, honestly. Is it the case? To support my case, I see that the case study page (https://www.hardbreak.wiki/introduction/case-study-led-to-a-...) has very similar paragraphs next to each other, the second one seemingly being the "genuine" one, and the first one being the LLM-rewritten version.I'm not against using LLMs to help fix typos or reformulate things, but you should definitely keep some of your style. The LLM that you used (if you used one) made the content super bland, and as a reader, I'm not really incentivized to browse more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately not Open Source, in the common definition of the word.From the license.md [0] page, under "Terms":&gt; Exemptions: Commercial Use: For inquiries regarding commercial use, please contact the author.[0] https://github.com/f3nter/HardBreak/blob/fd3d2d4cd17624a3f62...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shameless plug: For anybody wanting to get into rockchip SoC development I've created a (no AI) resource: https://danielc.dev/rk/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672821</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the computer game "Railroad Tycoon II," discussing its release, gameplay mechanics, and the impact it had on the simulation genre. It highlights the game's emphasis on strategy and economic management, allowing players to build and operate their own railroad empire. The piece also reflects on its innovative features, such as improved graphics and artificial intelligence, while considering the legacy it left in gaming history. Overall, the article captures the essence of the game and its significance within the realm of simulation titles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I played the Linux version the article mentions while at Goldman Sachs; a colleague on the Red Hat coverage team gave me a boxed copy of Corel Linux including the game. The port ran very well on my Red Hat Linux box at home.In retrospect it was part of a brief flurry of Linux ports of major games. I also got to play Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Neverwinter Nights; in both cases the publishers made Linux clients available for download that use the retail version's assets. Despite the valiant efforts of Wine and related projects, the world would have to wait 15 more years before Proton leveraged Wine technology to bring quasi-native games to Linux, and 20 years before Steam Deck made it the norm or close to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In this reviewer’s opinion, it was a sparkling creative success as well as a commercial one, making it all the more deserving of remembrance. We’ve seen a fair number of train games built on similar premises in the years since 1998, but I don’t know that we’ve ever seen a comprehensively better one.RRT2 is my all time favorite game, and has yet to find a spiritual successor in my heart. Alongside Anno 1602, it may be the oldest PC game I regularly open up and play for fun.The gameplay is still so good. The fact that the game is so open-ended and also so cutthroat, combined with the procedurally generated maps means it always feels fresh to play, even all these years later. The UI has aged but has not gotten in the way.And yes, as reviewer describes, it absolutely nails the theme. The sound design, the visuals, the music, the historical setting. Things feel gritty and real and tough. Just like the game's treatment of Robber Barons, the game perfectly balances romanticism with cynicism. The game made me love trains.I still remember learning as a child how stock trading on the margin worked when I simultaneously made and then lost a massive fortune attempting to buy out a rival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still keep this on my box and crack it open now and again.   I also pulled the music out of the distro and put it into my listening rotation while working.   You have to add your own hawk screech sounds though :-)I’m a total sucker for network optimization train games though.   Love the crayon rails games which I wrote about here:https://dave.org/posts/20221206_trains/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657585</guid></item><item><title>9.

The movie is split into roughly 1min sections, with each one done by a different creator. The quality is all over the place, in a hilarious way. One minute it's produced by a professional animator nailing the scenes, then the next minute it's people goofing around in their backyard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I drew a few frames in this, but it was a real shame to see how little quality control there was in the final cut. Makes it kind of unwatchable.Progress near the end was really fast, as lots of people had caught on and were racing to get as many frames in as possible.I really don't think this concept has been worn out yet, and someone could make their own version of this with a small review step and then we'd get some fun, actually watchable hand-drawn movies :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Artists in Europe have already been fighting to protect the copyright of Tintin to keep the artwork away from large language models (LLMs) training various AI algorithms.There is no copyright in the character anymore, so there’s nothing to protect.I really do not understand this perspective.  Do people also wish to use legal force to prevent others from working with, for example, Gainsborough, or Moliere, or Julius Caesar, or Homer?  Come on: at some point something has to enter the public domain and become part of the shared treasure of all mankind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to a Hacker News comment, my kids, ages 7-13. Have been watching an episode of Tintin from the internet archive every week, and they love it. Link: https://archive.org/details/tintinseries43&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post about Tintin, one of my top childhood influences. I have a new edition of all the albums (much better than mine) unopened and ready for when my kid grows enough. The TV show wasn't so good IMHO - of course the narrative was great because it came from the comics, but animation quality was just so-so, or at least that's how I remember it.If you liked Tintin and long for more comics of the same kind, I recommend you to try Blake and Mortimer. They're different (e.g. with a more serious and wordy style, hardly any comical gags, but also with more fantastic elements). But they are the closest I know, and in some aspects even better (I personally prefer them although I'm aware it's due to very subjective factors, most people would still rank Tintin higher overall and Blake and Mortimer don't have such a universal acclaim).The only thing I dislike about the post is the gratuitous rant on AI at the end. It is great news that Tintin joins the public domain. Especially great because it's one of these cases where the owners have been especially abusive, chasing fan efforts done as a labor of love, lest they harm their sales of overpriced merchandising.Why exactly should be worry about people generating AI images of Tintin? What is the harm done? We know what the original albums are, they will probably be preserved as long as there is human civilization (despite copyright, not thanks to it), and we can freely decide if we also want to read/watch/see derivative works (and which) or not. I just don't see the problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651043</guid></item><item><title>11. Entropy of a Large Language Model output</title><link>https://nikkin.dev/blog/llm-entropy.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of entropy in large language models (LLMs) and how it relates to the predictability of generated text. It explains that understanding entropy can help improve the performance and effectiveness of LLMs, highlighting the balance between randomness and coherence in text generation. Furthermore, the blog post explores the implications of entropy on model training and evaluation, offering insights into how adjusting entropy can influence the quality of output and the potential for innovative applications in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are observing "flattened logits" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774#page=12&amp;org=openai .The entropy of ChatGPT (as well as all other generative models which have been 'tuned' using RLHF, instruction-tuning, DPO, etc) is so low because it is not predicting "most likely tokens" or doing compression. A LLM like ChatGPT has been turned into an RL agent which seeks to maximize reward by taking the optimal action. It is, ultimately, predicting what will manipulate the imaginary human rater into giving it a high reward.So the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text). This reduction in entropy is a standard RL effect as agents switch from exploration to exploitation: there is no benefit to taking anything less than the single best action, so you don't want to risk taking any others.This is also why completions are so boring and Boltzmann temperature stops mattering and more complex sampling strategies like best-of-N don't work so well: the greedy logit-maximizing removes information about interesting alternative strategies, so you wind up with massive redundancy and your net 'likelihood' also no longer tells you anything about the likelihood.And note that because there is now so much LLM text on the Internet, this feeds back into future LLMs too, which will have flattened logits simply because it is now quite likely that they are predicting outputs from LLMs which had flattened logits. (Plus, of course, data labelers like Scale can fail at quality control and their labelers cheat and just dump in ChatGPT answers to make money.) So you'll observe future 'base' models which have more flattened logits too...I've wondered if to recover true base model capabilities and get logits that actually meaningful predict or encode 'dark knowledge', rather than optimize for a lowest-common-denominator rater reward, you'll have to start dumping in random Internet text samples to get the model 'out of assistant mode'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In LM research, it is more common to measure the exponentiation of the entropy, called perplexity. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting aspect of this behaviour used in the byte latent transformer model.Encoding tokens from source text can be done a number of ways, byte pair encoding, dictionaries etc.You can also just encode text into tokens (or directly into embeddings) with yet another model.The problem arises that if you are doing variable length tokens, how many characters do you put into any particular token, and then because that token must represent the text if you use it for decoding, where do you store count of characters stored in any particular token.The byte latent transformer model solves this by using the entropy for the next character.   A small character model receives the history character by character and predicts the next one.  If the entropy spikes from low to high they count that as a token boundary.   Decoding the same characters from the latent one at a time produces the same sequence and deterministically spikes at the same point in the decoding indicating that it is at the end of the token without the length being required to be explicitly encoded.(disclaimer: My layman's view of it anyway,  I may be completely wrong)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent outage of Canva and explores themes of system saturation and resilience in digital platforms. It analyzes how high demand can lead to vulnerabilities in online services, highlighting the consequences of such outages for users and businesses reliant on these tools. The author emphasizes the importance of building resilient systems that can withstand unexpected spikes in usage while reflecting on the broader implications for the tech industry and the necessity for better preparedness in the face of similar disruptions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had a similar CDN problem with releasing major Warframe updates: our CDN partner would inadvertently DDoS our origin servers when we launched an update because thousands of cold edges would call home simultaneously when all players players relogged at the same time.One CDN vendor didn't even offer a tiered distribution system so every edge called home at the same time, another vendor did have a tiered distribution system designed to avoid this problem but it was overwhelmed by the absurd number of files we'd serve multiplied by the large user count and so we'd still end up with too much traffic hitting the origin.The interesting thing was that no vendor we evaluated offered a robust preheating solution if they offered one at all. One vendor even went so far as to say that they wouldn't allow it because it would let customers unfairly dominate the shared storage cache at the edge (which sort of felt like airlines overbooking seats on a flight to me).These days we run an army of VMs that fetch all assets from every point of presence we can cover right before launching an update.Another thing we've had to deal with mentioned in the article is overloading back-end nodes; our solution is somewhat ham-fisted but works quite well for us: we cap the connection counts to the back end and return 503s when we saturate. The trick, however, is getting your load-balancer to leave the client connection open when this happens -- by default multiple LBs we've used would slam the connection closed so that when you're serving up 50K 503s a second the firewall would buckle under the runaway connection pool lingering in TIME_WAIT. Good times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem is similar to what electric utilities call "load takeup". After a power outage, when power is turned back on, there are many loads that draw more power at startup.The shortest term effects are power supplies recharging their capacitors and incandescent bulbs warming up. That's over within a second.Then it's the motors, which have 2x-3x their running load when starting as they bring their rotating mass up to speed. That extra load lasts for tens of seconds.If power has been off for more than a few minutes, everything in heating and cooling which normally cycles on and off will want to start. That high load lasts for minutes.Bringing up a power grid is thus done by sections, not all at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole incident report is interesting, but I feel like the most important part of the solution is buried here [0]:* "We're adding timeouts to prevent user requests from waiting excessively long to retrieve assets."When you get to the size of Canva, you can't forget your AbortController and exponential backoff on your Fetch API calls.--0: https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/canva-incident-report...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676529</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe that most of the papers presented here focus on acquiring knowledge rather than deep understanding. If you’re completely unfamiliar with the subject, I recommend starting with textbooks rather than papers. The latest Bishop’s "Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts (2024)" [1] is an excellent resource that covers the "basics" of deep learning and is quite updated. Another good option is Chip Huyen’s "AI Engineering (2024)" [2]. Another excellent choice will be "Dive into Deep Learning" [3], Understanding Deep Learning [4], or just read anything from fast.ai and watch Karpathy's lectures on YouTube.[1]: https://www.bishopbook.com

Just get a feel for how these LLMs respond then build a pretty and user friendly app on top of them. Knowing the difference between "multi head attention" and "single head attention" isn't very useful if you're just using OpenAI or Groq's API.Am I missing something here? I'd love to know where I'm wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hi! author here! putting together a list like this is intimidating - for every thing i pick there are a dozen other suitable candidates so please view this as a curriculum with broadly prescriptive weightings, with the understanding that the CURRENTLY_RELEVANT_PAPER is always a moving pointer rather than fixed reference.we went thru this specific reading list in our paper club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIMY9pLPdgif you are interested in a narrative version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42686457</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please stop putting salespeople in charge of highly technical product companies like Sonos. I'm so glad that Tom Conrad is an engineer by training. I hope he can turn this mess around.The key technical change that broke Sonos was abandoning their reliable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) system for device discovery in favor of mDNS, while also shifting from direct device communication to a cloud-based API approach. This new architecture made all network traffic encrypted and routed through Sonos cloud servers (even for local operations), adding significant overhead and latency, especially for older Sonos devices with limited processing power. They also switched from native platform-specific UX frameworks to a JavaScript-based interface while moving music service interactions through their cloud instead of direct SMAPI calls, resulting in slower performance and reduced functionality.For a more extended discussion, see this excellent LinkedIn post from Andy Pennell, a principal engineer at Microsoft with a deep technical understanding of Sonos systems. He created one of the most successful third-party Sonos apps for Windows Phone and worked directly with Sonos on their official Windows Phone 8 app.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-happened-sonos-app-techn...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's less the app, more the business decision to tell people who had spent thousands and thousands of dollars on elaborate sound systems to go throw it all in the trash and start over, all at once.Even Apple has never been that bad. They drop support for things over time but even their roughest transitions (x86, Apple Silicon) have come with extensive day 1 support for previous functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did they switch apps again, or is this still about the debacle when they switched from their original app to the second gen (S2) app many many years ago?Because while that was a shitshow, that's ancient history by now. Did they screw up another generational switch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687932</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone fill in the missing link in my understanding here? It seems like the post never gets around to explaining why waiting for 14272 years should make the river passable. (Nor why this river in particular, as opposed to any other obstacle.)The post alludes to a quirk that causes people not to get sicker while waiting; but it says they still get hungry, right? So you can't wait 14272 years there for any purpose unless you have 14272 years' worth of food, right?IIUC, the blogger goes on to patch the game so that you don't get hungry either. But if patching the game is fair play, then what's the point of mentioning the original no-worsening-sickness quirk?It kinda feels like asking "Can you win Oregon Trail by having Gandalf's eagles fly you to Willamette?" and then patching the game so the answer is "yes." Like, what's the reason I should care about that particular initial question? care so badly that I'd accept cheating as an interesting answer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mental image conjured up by this scenario is amusing.  Your impossibly patient party waits almost 15,000 years to cross a river in a state of suspended animation.  Then they finally cross the river and instantly wither away to dust because they had not had a good meal in 15 centuries.Something that was very common with BASIC interpreters but still baffling is how they were running on machines with extremely limited memory and fairly limited CPU time, but for some reason decided not to make integer types available to programmers.  Every number you stored was a massive floating point thing that ate memory like crazy and took forever for the wimpy 8 bit CPU with no FPU to do any work on.  It's like they were going out of their way to make BASIC as slow as possible.  It probably would have been faster and more memory efficient if all numbers were BCD strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You board the Generation Ship Oregon Trail with some trepidation. If the scientists are correct you will be in suspended animation for the next 14272 years. You already feel colder somehow. To the West you see a robotic barkeep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682813</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the practice of mudlarking along the River Thames in London, highlighting the discovery of garnets and other historical artifacts by individuals searching through the muddy banks. It delves into the rich history of the river as a site for finding lost treasures, elaborating on the thrill and context of these findings. The piece also discusses the evolution of mudlarking, the significance of the artifacts in understanding London’s past, and the personal stories of those who engage in this unique hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Only a few people are legally allowed to hunt for Thames garnets—or even remove them if they find them by chance. Mudlarks are among the few who are legally permitted to remove items from the riverbanks. To be a mudlark, you need a license, and in recent years, the British government suspended the issuing of new licenses for several years following a boom in applications during the pandemic lockdowns, leaving the already tight-knit mudlark community in a holding pattern.Well, that's something new I learned today. I wonder why they have to be licensed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my mind, "gems" is pronounced "games", just to mess with foreigners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not these gems but my son and I hunted for and found a couple of 19th century single use pipes and part of a brick with a cool logo a couple of years ago. Go to the Tower Bridge, there are stairs to go to the shore right next to it. Good hunting!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684257</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of suspending and resuming FreeBSD systems, detailing the underlying mechanisms and configuration steps required to effectively use these features. It outlines different methods for suspending a system, including device control commands, and emphasizes the importance of ensuring proper handling of system processes and services during these operations. The author provides practical tips and commands to help users effectively implement suspend/resume functionality while avoiding common pitfalls. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for FreeBSD users looking to manage power states efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP S3 sleep... Took years to get it to work reliably under Linux, then we had a good decade+ run of it "just working" like this, now back to trying to weed out all the wacky platform quirks and weird hardware/firmware behavior that make the S0ix states be just barely unusable.Maybe in another five years...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows used to work about this well back in the XP days, possibly Windows 7 as well. Plenty of times I hit the "sleep" button that Logitech put right next to the esc key (....) and resumed the system to find everything working as expected.Not sure if the embedded video is suspend to RAM or disk. Also not sure why there wasn't a PW prompt upon resume, but I'm not a BSD person, just someone who is paranoid about PW prompts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD and Suspend/Resume… About 10 years ago, I switched from FreeBSD to Linux because I couldn't get suspend/resume to work reliably (i.e. suspend/resume cycle succeeds and it doesn't drain my laptop battery in between) on FreeBSD on my Thinkpad.
And this was only Suspend to RAM. Suspend to Disk is really nice to have, especially if coupled with hybrid standby, as on macOS and Windows by default.I really appreciate that people still maintain FreeBSD on the desktop, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662552</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Northeastern University's recent redesign of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences curriculum, arguing that it moves away from essential computer science fundamentals. The author expresses concern that the new curriculum prioritizes trendy topics over core principles, potentially undermining students' foundational knowledge and problem-solving skills critical for the field. The piece emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between innovative content and traditional computer science education to ensure that graduates are well-equipped for future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to Caltech when they were contemplating similar things in the CS curriculum, although the normal curriculum was less radical than Northeastern's seems to be.There is a tension here that is being understated which is that people of every major now take the intro-level CS class because programming is integral to everything. Teaching algorithm design in that class is not particularly useful to a biologist who just wants to be able to cobble something together to analyze some data (usually in Python). As a result, the non-computer-scientists and non-software-engineers at the school would rather have a curriculum that is more "practical" and directly applies to research (or later class projects) the students might be doing.Some time not far in the future, we are going to accept that this is not the same thing at all as computer science and give the computer scientists a curriculum that is a lot heavier on math and theory while adding elective or core courses for non-major students on programming. That will end the compromised state that intro CS courses currently sit in. Right now, there isn't enough teaching talent to run those non-core courses (because that talent is earning the big bucks doing something else).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The end of an era. This is nothing less than a travesty honestly. The current (now former) curriculum at NEU was uniquely exceptional, and now it will be conformingly adequate. Anyone who complained about the difficulty or lack of "job-market applicability" of the  Fundies classes entirely missed the forest for the trees. The point is the design _process_, and using Racket forced this. It also demonstrated the magic that is possible with computer science. The Dr. Racket editor has features that do not exist in any other editor (e.g. visually tracing references, and so much more). The teaching language just got out of the way and let professors teach the essentials of program design, without the burden of language idiosyncrasies. My mind was honestly blown when Olin Shivers coded the Y combinator directly and showed us how to add recursion to a language. It felt like having occult knowledge, and it made me an acolyte to computer science. I mourn the loss of this curriculum for future students, especially considering the premium price tag they now pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The University that hosted "The Little Schemer" and all its derivatives. Those books were a delight and taught me to think about programming in a way that other languages had not. (Even if I didn't go to that University). 
https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/teaching.htmlI had been to a Scheme conference in Washington, adjunct to the Clojure Conference one year, and it was attended by many undergraduates from Northeastern, (and the authors of those books that I got a photo with.)I have to feel sympathy for those undergraduates I spoke to. They gave a strong feeling, even then (8 years ago), that it was time for the University to move on in language choice.I had a similar experience in the late 90s when the world was picking up Java, and our University insisted on teaching in Eiffel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655283</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that the internet has fundamentally changed human nature for the worse, arguing instead that negative behaviors were already inherent in society before the rise of online connectivity. It reflects on the nostalgia for a more amicable digital environment of the early 2000s while contending that this yearning overlooks the complexities of human interaction and the ways in which online platforms have amplified pre-existing social dynamics. The piece emphasizes the importance of recognizing that both positive and negative aspects of human behavior have always existed, irrespective of the technology used for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rose-tinted glasses are definitely a thing, as is nostalgia, and before I get into topics like the fact that UI/UX was actually scientifically better[0] back then, I'd like to take a moment to step back and consider what the author is actually implying.Yes, the world was centralised, and profit motives did exist. There was a time where it looked like AOL would legitimately kill the open web, and MSN was trying too at the same time. However; the early 00's were blessed with technological limitation.I distinctly remember the fact that IRC and the primitive forum systems we designed such that an identity tied to a real person was not something people felt the need to have.  To even care what a community thinks because ultimately there's quite literally another one just around the corner.The golden era of community creation was 2002-2004 (incidentally this is when my own IRC network formed). Because heavy handed moderation, power trips and so-on caused market pressures on moderation staff.Too heavy handed and authoritarian: you might kill your community.Not willing to stamp out toxic elements: you might kill your community.That's why we're nostalgic, because simpler times was a combination of:* more focused, human and often better moderation;* a deluge of communities where you could find a place; even if you were weird, like me - and;* an understanding that your identity was not important. "On the internet, nobody know's you're a dog".Yes, there were companies and profit seeking, the web itself was mired in proprietary plugins and jank standards. But there was an ease of hosting communities that is totally lost now.The best many of us can hope for these days, is a little carved out niche as a serf in a fiefdom.[0]: https://ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/course-notes/Micro...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there. I helped build it.It was better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do miss it though.20 years ago you could run your email domain on a machine in your basement and it would work.  You could send out email and it would be received, and the incoming spam volume was manageable.20 years ago, a buddy used an account on my net-connected Linux machine to scrape map tiles off Google Maps.  Google put a stop to it, and Gmaps wouldn't work any more on my (static) IP address.  I told him "you broke it, you fix it" and he got on the horn with someone at Google and got it unblocked.20 years ago, you could go on an online dating site and have a serious hope of finding a real mate for life. I did.  Several others I know did.20 years ago, you could go on Facebook, and see what your friends were up to.Sure, many things didn't exist back then.  But it was a more innocent world.  The internet was still an optimistic place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673596</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges facing WordPress as a content management system, highlighting issues such as security vulnerabilities, competition from other platforms, and the need for modernization. It emphasizes the declining user base and potential stagnation if the platform fails to adapt to user demands and technological advancements.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really think Matt is suffering from some sort of a mental breakdown. It’s a sad situation and there’s a lot to learn about open source projects with a huge user base and where the bottle necks exist. But I think people who know or are close to him should seriously consider an intervention. I can’t believe after two decades he’d just decide to throw it all out in a blazing fire and tarnish his reputation (and Wordpress) because of some valuation drop or being short on money. I think the dude needs help, and people close to him should try and talk sense into him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy how hosting wordpress, between 2003-2024, your main concern was Chinese/Russian hackers. And in 2025 you main concern should be if Mullenweg will hijack your website for his pissing match.Also he didn't shut down the sustainability team because he "didn't know about it". He shut it down because their stated goals are a threat to Mullenwegs dictatorship hold over wordpress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.This move by Matt to pull out of development all but guarantees a fork. The biggest argument against was the work that Automattic was putting into WordPress would be very hard to replicate in a new project. But if the community is going to be expected to do ~all of the work anyway, there's no reason to do that work inside Matt's personal fiefdom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687121</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this rather odd:&gt; “We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.”If your goal is to extract every possible cent from your existing customers, why would you also switch them from net 30 to requiring partial prepayment?  VMware wants money in general but should not have a cash flow problem, and forcing a monster early payment seems like it will force customers to notice an immediate problem and make a choice instead of allowing themselves to be slowly and steadily ripped off.If I were a pointy-haired CEO committed to the multiply-pricing-by-five strategy, I would do my best to sweeten the deal: offer generous payment terms, give nice-sounding discounts for up front commitments, give very large discounts for nodes that haven’t yet been leased to a customer, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely don't want to miniminize the significance of this.  This is huge!But, they did have some major benefits that most companies looking to do the same won't:&gt; Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform.&gt; The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes.Again, still a great accomplishment and an exciting milestone for them, but for people still stuck on VMWare that are looking to migrate, it's good to know about the above things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phrase "homebrew KVM platform" made me chuckle. All of the hyperscalers have a homebrew, aka proprietary platform using a hypervisor.  AWS has Nitro which seems to have been based on KVM but likely quite different by now.If you are selling VMs to customers, I can't understand a good reason to use VMWare.  The only reason would be if you are selling VMWare as a service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682671</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;User defined functions were implemented similarly as external execs in early shells. As the script was parsed, functions were dropped into /tmp without their wrappings and then called as external programs.  Since they would still reference parameters as $1, $2 etc, it just worked: function bodies and standalone sh scripts had the same interface! Such a clever idea to avoid managing an interpreted call stack in the parent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked C source file is an excellent example of ancient C, when it was still more closer to high level assembly:https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V2/cmd/glob.c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; PS: I don't know why expanding shell wildcards used a separate program in V6 and earlier, but part of it may have been to keep the shell smaller and more minimal so that it required less memory.See, I thought it was a nice separation of concerns and wondered why we lost such a nice approach, until I read:&gt; How escaping wildcards works in the V5 and V6 shell is that all characters in commands and arguments are restricted to being seven-bit ASCII. The shell and /etc/glob both use the 8th bit to mark quoted characters, which means that such quoted characters don't match their unquoted versions and won't be seen as wildcards by either the shellat which point I suddenly became a fan of ditching it. I do wonder if there's not some better way to factor that functionality out...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680437</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been my experience. Foundation models have completely changed the game of ML. Previously, companies might have needed to hire ML engineers familiar with ML training, architectures etc to get mediocre results. Now companies can just hire a regular software engineer familiar with foundation model API’s to get excellent results. In some ways it is sad, but in other ways the result you get is so much better than we achieved before.My example was an image segmentation model. I managed to create an dataset of 100,000+ images and was training UNets and other advanced models on it, always reached a good validation loss but my data was simply not diverse enough and I faced a lot of issues in actual deployment, where the data distribution kept changing on a day to day basis. Then, I tried DINO v2 from Meta, finetuned on 4 images and it solved the problem, handled all the variations in lighting etc with far higher accuracy than I ever achieved. It makes sense, DINO was train on 100M + images, I would never be able to compete with that.In this case, the company still needed my expertise, because Meta just released the weights and so someone had to setup the fine-tuning pipeline. But I can imagine a fine tuning API like OpenAI’s requiring no expertise outside of simple coding. If AI results depend on scale, it naturally follows that only a few well funded companies, will build AI that actually works, and everyone else will just use their models. The only way this trend reverses, is if compute becomes so cheap and ubiquitous, that everyone can achieve the necessary scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's tough to judge without seeing examples of the targets and the user photos, but I'm curious if this could be done with just old-school SIFT. If it really is exactly the same image in the in the corpus and on the wall, does a neural embedding model really buy you a lot? A small number of high confidence tie points  seems like it'd be all you need, but it probably depends a lot on just how challenging the user photos are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tracks with my experience.
We built a complex processing pipeline for an NLP classification, search and comprehension task. Using vector database of Proprietary data etc.We ran a benchmark of our system against an LLM call and the LLM performed much better for so much cheaper, in terms of dev time, complexity, and compute.
Incredible time to be in working in the space seeing traditional problems eaten away by new paradigms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660184</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the American food industry, tracing its origins back to the 1970s when it became a cheaper alternative to sugar due to government corn subsidies. It explores the health implications of HFCS consumption, its role in the obesity epidemic, and how food manufacturers adopted it widely because of its sweetness and preservative qualities. The piece also highlights the backlash against HFCS and the growing demand for natural sugars, reflecting on the complexities of food production and consumer choices in America.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corn Syrup and Sucrose are chemically identical from the standpoint of human metabolism, especially in solution where sucrose will have already disassociated. The only difference is that the ratio of fructose:sucrose is slightly (~5%) higher in corn syrup.I've always been dismayed at the misdirected fury around corn syrup as if it is somehow worse than any other sugar.If you want to go down the rabbit hole, try to find an actual proper double blind academic study that demonstrates a taste difference between sucrose and high fructose corn syrup. I'll be here waiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently watched an interesting video on the subject of corn syrup. Which led me into the fascinating rabbit hole of sugar chemistry.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY66qpMFOYoIf I might summarize.Your body can absorb three types of sugar into the blood, glucose, fructose and galactose. glucose is directly used by cells, the other two have to take a trip through the liver to turn them into glucose.Table sugar is sucrose. a complex sugar. which can be best thought of as a fructose and a glucose linked together.Corn syrup is a mixture of ~ 45% glucose 55% fructoseSucrose is quickly broken apart into glucose and fructose in several environments, high heat will do it, but also acidic environments. like your stomach, or a soda. a soda will be slightly acidic due to the carbon dioxide dissolved in it(carbonic acid). And some formulations(like coke) add additional phosphoric acid.And to spoil the video. Even if you put sucrose into a soda, that is not what you are going to be drinking. I was unable to figure out why it tastes different, are the ratios off? additional trace chemicals in one source?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Americans are paying their food higher than they should because industrials are paying more for sugar because lobbyist paid money to politicians to get them to put tariff on sugar import.So, basically American's money is going in the pocket of big corporation thanks to corrupt politicians.And it's still going on to these days, no government has yet removed these tariffs.Isn't tariff what started the American revolution ? Things changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687133</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wonder why conversation graphs look this way in Disco Elysium is because it's build using middleware called Articy:draft. Graphs is how Articy editor designed so it's only natural to visalize it this way.Since my team also made a story driven game using Articy that far less complex than Disco Elysium, but still complex. After we done it I can say for sure that whoever written Disco Elysium is trully insane, in a good way. While Articy is a good tool it's have own set of problems specifically awful performance on huge projects and I can't even imagine how developers of Disco Elysium managed to accompish it.So I pretty sure Disco Elysium isn't just masterpiece of storytelling and writing, but also insane technical achievement of whoever managed to get it all working together using tools they had. Even on a project of much smaller scale getting it all debugged, loop-free and free of tons of logical errors is very hard. Knowing how much variables Disco Elysium have I truly believe developers are all geniuses.PS: It's just everyone always wonder at how cool and complex modern rendering is or performance in game with millions of objects, but very few people understand how hard is to create story-driven game if there is more than 10 variables and not just int skill checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is something more supposed to show up?

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive map of the London Underground system, showcasing various tube lines, stations, and key transit information. Users can explore different tube routes, view station details, and access real-time updates on train services. The site aims to facilitate navigation through London's extensive underground network, making it easier for commuters and tourists to plan their journeys efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, it doesn't even mention the map. Instead, it invokes trademark registration numbers but these resolve [2] to LONDON UNDERGROUND and UNDERGROUND wordmarks and the roundel, none of them covering the map geometry as far as I can tell. It alleges a violation under Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act [3] but the act only applies to domains - and TfL never claims "traintimes" to be an infringing domain name (certainly doesn't look so under the marks cited). And, as a sibling comment points out, the act is a U.S. law but the site appears to be hosted in the U.K.If you think you have a case about the map, why not state it explicitly? The cynical answer is that ISPs have incentives not to care so making a case doesn't matter but ...[1] https://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/email2.txt

[3] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t see the issue. You were using the TfL schematic map which is very much a form of art. I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they asked you to take that specific map down or continue with a license.To remove the whole site because of that seems petty.It was clearly stated in their api documentation. It’s no
different than getting a license or usage rights for hosting an image or video on your site. Just because you are a hobbyist doesn’t mean you don’t have to follow the rules.This is coming from someone who is extremely pro fair-use and right to ownership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This licensing page appears to be a new addition to TfL, which probably suggests some bureaucrat negotiated a deal with a creative agency to license the tube map for pennies on the dollar, resulting in them sending out these notices.https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/business-and-advertisers/map-lic...Amusingly the notice was sent with references to USA trademark law.I am not sure how it works with regional governments, but copyright information for government-produced works tends to live as a "crown copyright" in the UK and former colonies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682876</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the harrowing experience of a luxury passenger train that became trapped for three days during a deadly winter storm near Donner Pass in 1952. The train, named the "City of San Francisco," was stuck in deep snow, leaving passengers stranded without sufficient supplies or heat. The piece details the efforts of the train crew and rescuers to keep everyone safe and fed while highlighting the brutal conditions they faced. Ultimately, the story illustrates both the challenges of winter travel in the Sierra Nevada and the resilience of the stranded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “In the 1950s, you had this mid-century hubris—technology could conquer all,” says Ty Smith, director of the California State Railroad Museum. “Part of the reason this episode happened was this unyielding optimism that we could solve every problem. In the face of a blizzard in the Sierra, that just wasn’t true.”My takeaway was the opposite. A hundred years before this, a different group was stuck in the same pass, and couldn't get help for 4 months. This situation resolved in 3 days, and there was no cannibalism. When something similar happened to an Amtrak in 2019, it only took a day and a half, and people still had access to Twitter the entire time. Not to diminish the suffering, etc., etc., but it seems like there's cause for optimism when it comes to technological progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The City was among America’s premier trains, a luxury streamliner that could hit 110 miles per hour while white-jacketed waiters balanced trays of cocktailsI wonder how passengers back then would have imagined rail travel today, 75 years later (aside from the life-threatening storms, of course). The Overland Route is now freight-only, and the closest equivalent, the California Zephyr, takes about 52 hours to make the journey this train did in just 40!More on topic, I was surprised to read:&gt; When the steam generators’ water tanks ran dry, heat disappeared, too.Weren't there surrounded by frozen water? Is there any reason snow couldn't be used in an emergency to heat the train?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I've driven Route 50 between Tahoe and Placerville a few times. Many of these times the weather has been quite bad. Many of these times I've had to wait for hours while an accident was cleared, or 12 foot snow drifts were plowed.When I'm traveling in mountain snow, I'm always very neurotic about prep. AWD or 4x4, water, chains, food, emergency kits, etc ... I always assume I could be stuck for 24 hours or more.In the meantime, I am constantly shocked by how many people make this trek with little or no respect for how deadly snow can be. The worst of it is when it puts others in danger: I'll never forget seeing a front-wheel drive sedan repeatedly driving up, then slipping back on a steep hill, while a line of 20 cars waited behind it.Part of it is just not knowing (I grew up in the east coast), but part of it is just human nature to not understand some things to be inherently dangerous. Snow and cold looks so serene, but cold in it's various forms has killed many more people than heat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657593</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper basically reinforces one of the tenets of transit noise and vibration analyses: if you don't maintain your system (specifically wheels and rails in the case of noise), things tend to get louder over time. BCRTC knows this [0] and they're working on it. As with all things, it's about time and money, but they are trying to be proactive with vehicle and track maintenance via rail grinding and complaint tracking.[0] https://archive.wheel-rail-seminars.com/archives/2022/rt-pap...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rail grinding noise of those Mark 1 Skytrain cars are really something. They literally made my ears hurt. For reference New York's subway rail noise never made my ears hurt that much.The explanation I read online is that Translink (the transport authority) lost one of the 2 rail grinders they contracted, and had to buy a grinder for use. So for a few years, while waiting for the grinder to arrive, the rails were not getting the regular grinding needed that'd lessen the wheels-on-rail noise.An unverified rumor I heard was that Translink cheaped out and bought a batch of substandard rails that are softer than needed. This means the rails wear out and become out of spec faster. The issue was compounded by the fact that the softer rails were used to replace a large portions of routes with sharp curves.The rolling stocks use linear induction propulsion, which means there is no electric motor on the train. The trains are very light as a result and require different maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And then you have Montreal with their very quiet rubber wheeled metro system. https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-techn...The problem with the Vancouver system is the combination of it being above ground and noisy. Ideally, you want to build density directly beside the tracks. That said, I lived near the tracks for a few years and although we could hear it, it wasn't that bad. We were fairly high up and had good windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681762</guid></item><item><title>31.

The author reflects on the benefits and drawbacks of using little languages in software development, emphasizing the importance of understanding the trade-offs involved. Ultimately, the piece encourages developers to appreciate the diversity of programming languages while critically assessing their practicality for real-world uses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My take is that, for productive work, language is much less important than everything around it. I need at the very least some kind of package management and dependency resolution system. Sometimes I want to read a CSV file, turn some of the content into JSON and serve it over HTTP. In an environment with sensible libraries, that's just a case of glueing stuff together. The problem is not little languages, it's little ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author seems to miss that many people don't write their lisp (or their game, or their code-golfing one-liner, or their befunge program) for it to be used, they write it because they enjoy writing a lisp.As for those who believe their language of choice can actually become mainstream, it's a long, soul-crushing and miserable road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The problem seems to be languages with a small, well written specification.that’s why I’m making my language as big and poorly specified as possible:https://hyperscript.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655544</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "comptime" or compile time as a form of configuration in programming. It explores how using compile-time techniques can lead to more efficient and safer code by allowing certain operations and configurations to be determined before runtime. The author presents examples highlighting the benefits of comptime, such as improved performance and compile-time error detection, as well as its applications in various programming languages. The piece encourages developers to consider comptime as a valuable tool for enhancing their code's configurability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun story, while at FAANG I was once tasked with making a parameter configurable via flag. This wasn't super easy for various reasons, but I pointed out that it was configurable already: all you had to do was submit a PR to change the hardcoded value in the code and it would update everywhere and that wasn't much different from how we already configured runtime parameters by submitting a PR that updated the config file.I got a good chuckle out of my coworkers but as I've gotten more experienced there's a grain of truth in that. Actually the main non-joking objection was that deployments are slow so if we needed to, reconfiguring runtime flags was a good amount faster. But that made me think: if deployments and builds are super fast, would we still need configuration in the conventional yaml and friends sense? It could save a lot of foot guns from misconfiguration and practically speaking, we essentially never restarted the server to reconfigure it. From the article,&gt; Unless you have really good reason to, you probably should not do this for normal options - it makes your library much more rigid by requiring that the user of your library know the options at comptime.I dunno, actually that sounds really great to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652730</guid></item><item><title>35.

Some comments:1) May want to auto-magically handle input for things like apostrophes. E.g. "O'Hare"... It looks like somewhere in the process this data was not preserved/saved/sent, but people will probably try to search with it. Might also want to handle the accent marks and what not too2) The terms &amp; conditions for Step 3, the checkbox at the bottom doesn't have enough contrast when checked. I do not have a disability, and I still found it very faint. Someone with a disability would likely have a lot of trouble (not to mention, it requires scrolling to the bottom to check it in the first place, which isn't awesome for accessibility)3) I appreciate the warning on the terms and conditions about seeing things you might not want to see. A good reminder for those that might not want to tarnish a memory of someone... Reminds me of the DNA tests for Christmas, or learning about Punnett Squares and genetics, sometimes you might not want to go looking :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I previously tried getting military records for my deceased grandfather. From what I can recall, it was complicated by the fact that I wasn't "next of kin", which would limit the data I'd have access to. Even my parent, who was next of kin, would have needed additional paperwork as proof, e.g. a death/marriage certificate for my grandmother.On one hand, if this works then I'll be happy to have the information I otherwise wouldn't have. But on the other hand, all these processes, no matter how convoluted, exist for a reason. It feels weird bypassing those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you aware that the API appears to be publishing the SSN of each individual? Although I’m aware most SSNs are leaked in one breach or another, I still thought it was customary in the U.S. to attempt to keep such information somewhat protected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of literate programming, which emphasizes writing code that is easily readable and understandable by humans in addition to being executable by machines. It highlights the importance of documenting the thought process behind the code and integrating narrative and code together. The author argues that this approach fosters better understanding and communication among programmers while also serving as a self-documenting method. The post includes insights into tools and techniques that facilitate literate programming, promoting a shift in how coding can be approached to enhance clarity and collaboration in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are at least two aspects to literate programming.Knuth wrote TeX in Pascal, which has a couple of limitations that annoyed him:- Pascal has no module system: you can’t break a program up into multiple files- The order of presentation of a program is dictated by the needs of a single-pass compilerThe tooling that supports literate programming is mostly about overcoming these problems with Pascal. (Knuth also uses it to split up larger procedures in a manner that makes me think of very un-structured C macros.) Most other languages are more flexible so they have much less need for a technology like tangle/weave.The opposite extreme is Literate Haskell, which doesn’t need any preprocessor. You just feed your TeX document to ghc and it picks the code out of the \begin{code} blocks. Or instead of Knuth style you can write in Bird style, where the file is a plain text document with code marked by &gt; quote blocks.The other aspect of literate programming is organizing the code like a book. This is very difficult to do well. When I think of how I approach a codebase, it reminds me of textbooks that have a complicated diagram describing multiple suggested orders of reading (a chapter per module?), or the informal introduction to Algol 68 with its orthogonal table of contents. Ideally a program’s commentary should span both the explanatory and reference documentation quadrants.What strikes me about Knuth’s literate programming is how hypertextual it is, albeit using printed cross-references and indexes. It seems to be in desperate need of interactive pixels. And an underlying programming language that has better support for Knuth’s preferred size of code fragment.On balance I think modern tools achieve Knuth’s goals better than tangle/weave. Modern languages let you organize code much closer to its narrative structure, without WEB’s unhygienic scoping. Editors and IDEs and documentation browsers give you hyperlinks everywhere.It’s then “just” a matter of writing the exposition. Less literate programming, more literate programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a lot of time thinking about no/low code and one conclusion I came to was that there was "the program" and then there was the way it displayed.  Considerhttps://www.knime.com/why-visual-workflowsthe topology of the connection between the blocks is essential to execute the program;  that doesn't require coordinates for the blocks,  but the visual editor does.  The ideal tool has a clean separation between these.  People are dimly aware of the "hairball" graph problem and looking for a visualization algorithm that banishes them:https://blog.tomsawyer.com/untangle-the-hairball-with-bundle...yet the real problem is that if your goal is to communicate you want to tell stories with visualizations and you need a visualization organized around a story -- and for each story you tell you need a different visualization.I see the same thing with literate software.  I can think of a number of interesting stories to tell about last month's chess program (e.g. "move generation",  "alpha-beta search",  for instance.)  For a particular story I want to focus on certain things and completely eliminate other things.  The same code might appear in more than one story.  To make all this work there has to be a clean separation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with literate programming is that most people aren’t good writers, and they aren’t interested in developing their writing skills - they only want to code.Already it’s pulling teeth just to get literate commit messages…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009</guid></item><item><title>37.

Our motivation for developing CopperSpice was to change the core design of the libraries leveraging modern C++ functionality.&gt; The redesign allowed us to completely remove the Meta-Object Compiler (moc) system. Moc is a code generator and did not support many aspects of modern C++ including templates, complex data types, static type checking, and relied heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves run time performance, reduces the complexity of the build process, and allows more issues to be detected at compile time.This sounds pretty great. Does anyone have experience using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any reason to not upstream the refactorings?The default theme doesn't look that great on mobile. At least one can change the side menu size.The challenges I'm facing with doxygen is to create a seamless integration with a MkDocs site, but not just for a single version. The current workaround of manually copying the generated MkDocs header and footer isn't very automated...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Supports C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, (Corba and Microsoft) IDL, Objective-C, Python, PHP, TCLWondering how Python support stacks up against Sphinx.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page 29 is the first code.  You need to work through 'War and Peace' of text before you get there.  This is not good for a "young person".  They need to get there quicker IMHO.I always say that the reason I got into programming (at the age of 10) was because of the BBC Micro User Guide [1].* Page 5: first code written (and importantly, code that has a visual component)* Page 6: Drawing lines* Page 7: Playing soundsetc.I realised very quickly that I was able to make a game.  And that was it, I was hooked for life.The Raspberry Pi took its inspiration from the BBC Micro (Model B).  It's a shame that there wasn't more of a push to make it as easy as the original Model B to get going and start programming.(Of course I realise that it's running Linux where nothing is simple, but yeah, I'm not sure it necessarily helps kickstart the next generation in the way the original BBC Micro did)[1] https://archive.org/details/BBCUG/mode/2up?view=theater&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To install the BCPL System on the Raspberry Pi you must first ob-
tain a copy of the file bcpl.tgz [...]Version numbers, what are those ...When you have some problem with bcpl.gz, just send an e-mail. Be sure to mention the approximate date when you obtained bcpl.gz. Like was it closer to Halloween last year, or more toward Thanksgiving or Christmas? Be sure to download bcpl.tgz daily, until the problem goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice introduction text with detailed description to set-up a R.Pi and interesting examples (AES, calculating Euler's number, Rubik's cube etc.).  Shame it uses an utterly obsolete language of which most interesting feature (byte code interpreter making porting the compiler to new architectures comparatively easy) was important in the seventies with its plethora of architectures (many short-lives), but hardly today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673435</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the evolution of skyscraper architecture, focusing on the trend of utilizing glass as the primary material in modern towers. It discusses factors contributing to this phenomenon, including advancements in technology, the quest for natural light, and the desire for aesthetic appeal. The emphasis on transparency and the minimalist design of glass facades reflect both functional and cultural shifts in urban environments, highlighting how these structures symbolize modernity and progress while addressing energy efficiency and sustainability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two lines that summarize the article for me:&gt; Why developers chose glass curtain walls -
So why did developers embrace the glass box aesthetic? Unsurprisingly, it comes down to economics.&gt; Ornamentation and glass curtain wall aren’t mutually exclusive.And while I agree that ornamentation is very likely lost to cost savings, the switch to glass walls is also just a huge improvement for people inside the building.Having worked in an all-glass tower and also a "normal" office building, my personal experience is that the natural light that giant windows let in and the external views that they afford are both phenomenal improvements to the atmosphere. It's really a much more pleasant environment to work in. The only catch is that the interior or window treatment design needs to consider glare from sunlight directly hitting computer screens and/or eyes.So, sure, maybe something something costs, but people also pay attention to environmental ergonomics now in ways that they never used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Air conditioning was becoming common, making it possible to cool buildings with large expanses of windows that might otherwise get too hot in the summer.I guess the cost of having to install and run AC is dwarfed by the savings in construction costs?Or is this a case of operational costs being ignored in favor of capital costs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always thought large buildings have more windows because the inner spaces would otherwise get 0 natural light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683736</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've been using Taskfile, which is fantastic and super understandable, but it's only a task-runner and as such wouldn't meet OP's needs. I hated `just` and did not find it at all intuitive.Only problem I have with the article is saying that Ruby doesn't work on Windows is just categorically false. It's one of the easiest languages to install and use on Windows, even easier than C# and Java, and I'm a Java/Kotlin dev, so that's saying something. It's literally just a single exe/msi installer.But you wouldn't want to be using Rake anyway, it's not really that good, and is only useful if you're working in an environment where you don't want to install anything and you hate Make. Then Ruby is very often installed by default with Rake and so you get a 'free' build tool. Rake was good 10 years ago, but not so much anymore.Anyway, if you needed a specific kind of tool and built it then all the power to you. Can't blame you for not wanting to use the other options!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish you success with this! I really was surprised to see that there isn’t a modern make replacement that actually does what make does, and does it well: build /compile things with a notion of inputs and outputs and out-of-date checks. Most appear to be “just” command runners. That’s a very useful thing to have, but it’s not really a make replacement.
Then again, many “build tools” do get very large and unwieldy eventually, so maybe it’s more a case of the good make replacements simply getting too much traction…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why a new language?In my opinion, Starlark (in rust, Apache 2: &lt;https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust/blob/v0.13.0/LICEN...&gt;) is the way since it is designed for sandboxed environments and also (AIUI) was initially designed to support Bazel, a build toolNow, I'm totally on board that people can hate on whitespace sensitive languages, but if my choice was "make my own language that no one has ever heard of" or "delete the Python hater's emails" ...It also would mean that you could tag your Werkfile in .gitattributes with linguist annotations[1] and they'd syntax highlight, which isn't the case with your own language https://github.com/simonask/werk/blob/5990c8a9536a1a76c3da59...1: https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/v9.0.0/docs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672863</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;New York has begun enforcing a new broadband law aimed at enhancing accessibility and affordability of internet service, despite significant opposition from internet service providers (ISPs) who attempted to block its implementation. The law mandates that ISPs offer plans for $15 per month to low-income households, with the goal of increasing connectivity for underserved communities. The article discusses the background of the legislation, the resistance from ISPs, and the potential impact on consumers and the broadband market in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The New York law requiring Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes will take effect on Wednesday this week following a multi-year court battle in which the state defeated broadband industry lobby groups.I don't like these types of mandates because it distorts the market. Politicians get to say "we provided X people with internet service and we didn't use a dollar of tax payers' money". Which sounds nice, but you can't really get something for nothing. This will increase costs for ISPs and likely increase prices for others. How much? Who knows!If politicians feel that low income New Yorkers deserve reduced cost or free internet, give them a voucher for internet. Better yet, figure out how much of a voucher they would need and give them a check. Let them decide whether they want to buy internet, or better food or housing or whatever else. Or if you go the voucher router, giving them options lets ISPs compete for this. Don't think taxpayers should pay? Make a special ISP tax and give it to these people to make it budget neutral.Not to mention the red tape and abuse this will create. I really don't want me ISP to track my income.What they decided on is the worst possible option as it results in hidden costs and bad incentives. The only people its good for (compared to the alternatives), is politicians who can by dictate just seemingly create free things for people for no cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Price increases are to be capped at 2 percent per year, and state officials will periodically review whether minimum required speeds should be raised.2% is below current inflation rates, so this could potentially go haywire super easily.New York has been here before; the subway was fixed to a nickel for four decades, which ended up bankrupting the private subway companies and set the stage for the underfunded, deferred maintenance of future decades, which New York is still working through the backlog for nearly a hundred years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I agree that people getting internet in this day and age is _basically_ a necessity (and thus the govt should interfere when needed to make that happen), doing it in this way is the worse possible implementation. Was it necessary in this case? I don't know.First, foster competition. I don't know the NY landscape, but in the West Coast, it's not uncommon for a residency to have effectively a single option for ISP. Ensure consumers have options (incentivize creation of new ISPs? Stop allowing big corporations to buy small ones? break up big corporations and force them to compete?)Second could the government offer public internet? (ie, be a player in the market).Only as a last resort should these types of heavy hand price enforcements should be taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687861</guid></item><item><title>45.

All this other crap, all these holiday parties, all of this let's dance in diversity videos, no that's not what I'm here for .Most of the time coming to the office actually adds a bunch of unnecessary crap that is completely unneeded. If you can't get your job done remotely, what's the stop you from also slacking off in the office. I have to go back to the office for a while last year times were hard and I didn't have another option .We're just talking to each other, shooting the s**, and it was cool to meet some Junior Devs who were just starting their career. But none of that made me a more productive worker.If I had to think, I imagine the entire point of RTO mandates is to keep cities sustainable.If every single office job went remote, what's the point of a city like New York. Who's going to willingly pay $6,000 for an apartment, ride the trains for over an hour a day, if you can just sit at home in a much cheaper city .However, to quote a famous philosopher, it's a big club and you ain't in it. The powers that be one as many people in office chairs as possible, so they're real estate holdings appreciate in value.Billy Bob's bagels also benefits from this, although I'd imagine he's not able to have the same amount of pool as the real estate titans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think RTO mandates will be the straw that broke the camel's back, for a lot of Americans. Workers in sectors that previously wouldn't even think about unionizing, are now having serious discussions.Going back to commutes, wasting time, for no obvious reason - yeah, that did wake up people.EDIT: I'm talking about rigid 5 days a week RTO policy. As other have pointed out, having a flexible WFH policy is often "good enough" for most people. Not all want 100% WFH, but taking away the flexibility of WFH a couple of days a week, if you want, feels like a shitty deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally think for many jobs, in-person is actually better.SWE in a place with good process, remote is probably fine. Generally similar for jobs with clear deliverables on that kind of time scale. if it's more research oriented, there is a huge benefit to being in-person in front of a whiteboard. For a job with shifting requirements day to day (like some legal or banking work), it is easier to coordinate everyone in the same office.unclear if this overcomes cost to employees of the commute, housing, etc., but the value is there.however there is also "worst of all possible worlds" RTO, where you have to commute to the office because the office is the place you are required to sit for your 4+ hours of Zoom calls per day with other colleagues in other offices. I expect a lot of companies are going to do this, which is totally stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688159</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;on year 7 of my startup and profitable. I'd like to add a few things.1. look for a boring problem that needs solving. related to the product market fit. a lot of founders are trying to build a sexy solution to a problem that no one has.2. Sales is half the equation!. you can have the best engineering team in the world but it means nothing if you dont have good sales. and good sales people don't just get sales. they are the first point of contact for your prospective customers. Empower them to get feedback and ideas for how to evolve your product. half of our features at my startup are things we never would have thought of until our sales guys kept telling us how many restaurants were requesting the feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, I got it. If I want to make a successful startup, I simply just need to get an insane amount of funding and develop a great product based on detailed market research that fits the market and solves an actual problem. I also should find a way to actually sell a product in order to avoid negative cash flow problems.This reminds me a bit of the main reason why restaurant businesses fail according to some TV shows I've watched: They have a lousy cook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article must be pretty great to make it to the front page while messing about with how scrolling works:-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660424</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon known as "Havana Syndrome," characterized by mysterious health issues reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers, primarily in Cuba and later in other countries. It delves into the theories surrounding its cause, including potential foreign attacks using advanced technology, with a particular focus on Russia's possible involvement. The piece examines the government’s response, the ongoing investigations, and the implications for U.S.-Russia relations, while highlighting the challenges faced in conclusively identifying the syndrome's origins and the broader impact on personnel safety in diplomatic missions.&lt;/p&gt;

We already know directed-energy weapons are possible [0], what are the challenges in exploring the space until you're able to build an approximate match for what people report having experienced?The most scary thing about these kinds of systems seems to me to be the potential for urban terrorism. If it doesn't leave any trace and it can penetrate walls, it could be used to attack people working for rival organizations as well as general harassment. Imagine a tool that lets you disrupt someone's sleep, using that over months would be enough to drive them insane or at least seriously hamper their productivity and performance. For example: if a rival sports team is visiting and you're able to disrupt their sleep that might be enough to give your team an edge.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential banning of the game "Luck Be a Landlord" from Google Play due to concerns related to its gambling themes and mechanics. It explores the implications of such a ban on the game's accessibility and the broader impact on similar games within the digital marketplace. The piece highlights community reactions, developer responses, and the ongoing conversation about gambling regulations in mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LBAL and Balatro being banned or 18+ age-gated for having gambling "vibes" despite not actually simulating gambling, while the stores are full of gacha games which are designed to bleed players dry through real-money gambling mechanics is a ridiculous state of affairs. The latter makes Google and Apple insane amounts of money though so of course they're not going to do anything about them unless their hand is forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a “finished” game or app on google play has never worked well for me. 
There is constant nag to update it for a variety of reasons. Even if the nag comes from device related sdk updates (just recompiles), a reupload requires you to comply with latest policies that often seem very subjective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be fair, if you were to design a game meant to create false positives for gambling, it would probably be a game just like this.While a sympathize with the dev, this is a bit like carrying around a replica gun in public and complaining that you constantly have to ward off police reports.Parents are gonna see the slots and file reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683567</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so few people blog these days makes blogging even more influential than it used to be.You can establish yourself as something of a global expert on some topic just by writing about it a few times a month over the course of a year!Don't expect people to come to your blog. Practice https://indieweb.org/POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere - post things on your blog and then tweet/toot/linkedin/submit-to-hacker-news/share-in-discord etc.Also, don't worry too much about whether you get traffic at the time you write something. A lot of the reputational value comes from having written something that you can link people to in the future. "Here are my notes about that topic from last year: LINK" - that kind of thing.There's a lot to be said for writing for its own sake, too. Just writing about a topic forces you to double-check your understanding and do a little bit more research. It's a fantastic way of learning more about the world even if nobody else ever reads it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define "worth it", but I've written a blog post about some printer driver issue two years ago and it now happened twice that someone (Older person, not very technical) reached out over email and asked for some further help and I could walk them step by step through using a Terminal, booting into macOS recovery mode and fixing the issue.The Apple store and Epson told them to do a clean install so they were very grateful and it made me happy that I could help them. Worth it for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write for myself. I don't track, I don't care if people read my blog.I do mention my blog on my resume together with code repositories. It is some kind of portfolio, and it is a good learning experience for me.I don't think that it is worth "building a brand", unless you want to specialize in building brands. It's not like someone at Google will ever read your blog and offer you a job; if you want to work at Google, learn how to pass their interview process. If you want to be visible on social media, probably you need to follow a ton of people, engage with them, produce a lot of content and the kind of content that people like or repost. This has nothing to do with a personal blog, though.Another thing is that if you find it worth blogging about, it's probably niche in the first place. If it's common knowledge, it's probably already on Wikipedia, or StackOverflow, or now some LLM (and if you wait long enough, your blog will be part of the LLM, whether you want it or not).I see it like FOSS: if you do it with the hope that many people will use it, then I think it's a bad idea. Because you work for free and people will never be happy. If you do it for yourself, it's great!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42685534</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godot uses their own engine features for the GUI of the editor itself as you’d use to make a game itself with.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/list_of_feature...&gt; Godot's GUI is built using the same Control nodes used to make games in Godot. The editor UI can easily be extended in many ways using add-ons.And they even go as far as to explicitly say the following:&gt; Godot's small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to frameworks like Electron or Qt.I’ve only used Godot for game development, not GUI stuff yet. (The game I started making doesn’t have any menus, I’m working on gameplay and level design first.) But I’m personally keeping a mental note in the back of my mind to investigate building bona fide desktop applications with Godot also, and not just games.Also, if you’re going to make an application instead of a game, they have a special mode they recommend that you use:&gt; When creating a non-game application, make sure to enable low-processor mode in the Project Settings to decrease CPU and GPU usage.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#is-it-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For truly novel UIs with high dynamism it is probably a good decision.For anything else it is almost certainly more work for the dev and more resource-intensive for the system.One thing I haven't seen anyone else mention is that a game engine is generally going to be re-rendering constantly, as part of the game/render loop. This is because in a game it is almost always the case that something is changing on screen at any given moment.In a more "normal" app UI, most things are static, so having a render loop operate like that doesn't make much sense. So instead things are optimized for the static case – if nothing is happening on screen, resources are not being used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It really depends on your App and probably the game engine.There's a reason why a lot of people use Electron for apps and it's because the amount of effort it takes to write HTML / JS and have a functional UI is very little.It seems like you like the idea in order to implement a novel UI and I suspect then yes a game engine is a good idea. However, do consider the UX of your app. Excel is a spreadsheet because that is pretty much the best way to display tabular data. So if the novel UI isn't a better UX than an existing way you probably don't want to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672339</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a malicious npm package by Snyk, which was designed to target web applications by stealing sensitive data such as environment variables and API keys. It highlights how the package was able to evade detection by using obfuscation techniques and discusses the broader implications of such threats in the JavaScript ecosystem. The piece emphasizes the importance of security practices in software development and the need for continuous monitoring of dependencies to safeguard against vulnerabilities and malicious software.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of how NPM works, it's quite easy to trick it to fetch the packages from the public registry instead, which could be used by an attacker [0].Assumably, this Snyk employee either found or suspected that some part of Cursor's build is misconfigured as above, and uploaded those packages as a POC. (Given the package description "for Cursor", I'd think they were hired for this purpose.)If that's the case, then there's not much to see here. The security researcher couldn't have used a private NPM registry to perform the POC if the point is to demonstrate a misconfiguration which skips the private registry..[0] In particular, many proxies will choose the public over the private registry if the latest package version is higher: https://snyk.io/blog/detect-prevent-dependency-confusion-att...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also interestingly the Snyk cofounder has started a competitor to cursor

If you know what to look for, there are definite signals that these packages are dodgy.  All of these packages have just two files:  package.json and index.js (or main.js).  This is one of several flags that you can use to determine if a package is legit or not.This works -- maybe OK for top-level packages. But for transitive dependencies it's nearly impossible to vet every transitive dependency.If you're pulling in a package that has 400 dependencies, how the heck would you even competently check 10% of that surface area? https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#top-1000...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690473</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of creativity in various fields and emphasizes the importance of fostering an environment that encourages creative thinking. It explores the factors that contribute to creativity, such as openness to experience and the ability to connect disparate ideas. The author also provides practical suggestions for enhancing creativity, including engaging in diverse experiences, practicing mindfulness, and collaborating with others. Overall, the piece highlights creativity as a vital skill in problem-solving and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pure, disinterested A/B testing where the goal is just to find the good way to do it, and there's enough leverage and traffic that funding that A/B testing is worthwhile is rare.More frequently, A/B testing is a political technology that allows teams to move forward with changes to core, vital services of a site or app. By putting a new change behind an A/B test, the team technically derisks the change, by allowing it to be undone rapidly, and politically derisks the change, by tying it's deployment to rigorous testing that proves it at least does no harm to the existing process before applying it to all users. The change was judged to be valuable when development effort went into it, whether for technical, branding or other reasons.In short, not many people want to funnel users through N code paths with slightly different behaviors, because not many people have a ton of users, a ton of engineering capacity, and a ton of potential upside from marginal improvements. Two path tests solve the more common problem of wanting to make major changes to critical workflows without killing the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the assumptions of vanilla multi-armed bandits is that the underlying reward rates are fixed. It's not valid to assume that in a lot of cases, including e-commerce. The author is dismissive and hard wavy about this and having worked in in e-commerce SaaS I'd be a bit more cautious.Imagine that you are running MAB on an website with a control/treatment variant. After a bit you end up sampling the treatment a little more, say 60/40. You now start running a sale - and the conversion rate for both sides goes up equally. But since you are now sampling more from the treatment variant, its aggregate conversion rate goes up faster than the control - you start weighting even more towards that variant.Fluctuating reward rates are everywhere in e-commerce, and tend to destabilise MAB proportions, even on two identical variants, they can even cause it to lean towards the wrong one. There are more sophisticated MAB approaches that try to remove the identical reward-rate assumption - they have to model a lot more uncertainty, and so optimise more conservatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with this approach is that it requires the system doing randomization to be aware of the rewards. That doesn't make a lot of sense architecturally – the rewards you care about often relate to how the user engages with your product, and you would generally expect those to be collected via some offline analytics system that is disjoint from your online serving system.Additionally, doing randomization on a per-request basis heavily limits the kinds of user behaviors you can observe. Often you want to consistently assign the same user to the same condition to observe long-term changes in user behavior.This approach is pretty clever on paper but it's a poor fit for how experimentation works in practice and from a system design POV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650954</guid></item><item><title>3.

If exposing this to the Internet we recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy, such as SWAG, and ensuring a secure authentication solution is in place. From the web interface a terminal can be launched and it is configured for passwordless sudo, so anyone with access to it can install and run whatever they want along with probing your local network."I hope everyone intrigued by this interesting and potentially very useful project takes heed of this warning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selkies[1] is another interesting project in this space.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant security vulnerability in Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system that puts millions of users at risk. The flaw allows malicious actors to exploit certain permissions granted by users to access sensitive information without proper authorization. It highlights the potential impact of the vulnerability, advises on best practices for users to secure their accounts, and emphasizes the importance of robust security measures to protect against such flaws.

And isn't it also a failure on e.g. Microsoft or OpenAI's parts, since they're providing service to a defunct business entity who can't pay its bills?To describe this as a vuln in oauth doesn't really make sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't understand here, the proper way to use Google's OpenID implementation to authenticate someone is to use the `sub` claim. Don't use the email, don't verify it yourself, use the `sub` claim. It's a known fact and is properly documented[1].If the `sub` changes, it's because it's not necessarily the same person so have a flow ready for that. It could be an employee left and came back, a domain change, an IT error that lead to a reprovisioning of the user, etc.I also fail to see how the proposed solution of having a 'A unique user ID that doesn’t change over time' is different from the `sub` claim. However, the new ID associated to the domain could make sense to enforce a strong 'Everyone from the @domain.com has access' statement.[1] https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more of a fundamental issue with the way we rely on DNS to secure *gestures wildly* all the things. The fact that domains can expire and be registered by someone new allows the new owner to do almost anything the old owner could have done when it comes to anything trusting email addresses, or anything else relying on DNS (ACME certs) for authentication.It's great for "do they own this right now" validation and that's what we use it for, but beyond that links will be saved, email addresses will be added to databases and address books alike, and that's more or less a reality of most systems. For example, my snail mail (and occasionally packages) is still mistakenly delivered to my former addresses from time to time just because it's hard to track who has that address, and update it everywhere. The same goes for internet infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699099</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The fluid pendant project by MITxela showcases a unique and intricate kinetic sculpture that visually demonstrates fluid dynamics using a pendulum mechanism. The design features a pendulum with a reservoir that allows colored liquid to flow in conjunction with its swinging motion, creating mesmerizing patterns that highlight principles of physics and fluid behavior. The project emphasizes creativity in engineering and design, illustrating how art and science can combine to produce visually stunning and educational displays. It also provides insights into the development process and the technology used in the creation of the sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating video. I watched almost the whole thing without planning to, I got sucked in.This is one of those examples of software that reminds me of my struggle to understand how LLMs are passing code evaluations that culminate with people declaring that they are now better than even the best human coders. I have tried to get LLMs (specifically, Claude and ChatGPT, trying various models) to assist with niche problems and it's been a terrible experience. Fantastic with CRUD or common algorithms, terrible when it's something novel or unusual.The author creates his own version of a "FLIP simulation". I'm going to go out on a limb and posit that even ChatGPT's unreleased o3 model would not be up to the task of writing the software that powers this pendant. Is this incorrect? I realize perhaps that my comment is a little off-topic given that this is not an AI project. However, this project seems like an excellent example of the sort of thing that I am quite skeptical the supposedly "world-class" artificial software engineers could pull off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; access to a lathe is a fundamental human rightA teacher once told me their (middle? high?) school was the last in their state with lathes.  Something which couldn't be created there today, and couldn't exist now in some other states, but which had been repeatedly grandfathered, since its creation with many others, just after World War 2. And that it would disappear upon the first serious accident, leaving none at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charlieplexing:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683389</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice, these ideas have been around for a long time but never commercialized to my knowledge. I've done some experiments in this area with simulations and am currently designing some test circuitry to be fabbed via Tiny Tapeout.Reversibility isn't actually necessary for most of the energy savings. It saves you an extra maybe 20% beyond what adiabatic techniques can do on their own. Reason being, the energy of the information itself pales in comparison to the resistive losses which dominate the losses in adiabatic circuits, and it's actually a (device-dependent) portion of these resistive losses which the reversible aspect helps to recover, not the energy of information itself.I'm curious why Frank chose to go with a resonance-based power-clock, instead of a switched-capacitor design. In my experience the latter are nearly as efficient (losses are still dominated by resistive losses in the powered circuit itself), and are more flexible as they don't need to be tuned to the resonance of the device. (Not to mention they don't need an inductor.) My guess would be that, despite requiring an on-die inductor, the overall chip area required is much less than that of a switched-capacitor design. (You only need one circuit's worth of capacitance, vs. 3 or more for a switched design, which quadruples your die size....)I'm actually somewhat skeptical of the 4000x claim though.  Adiabatic circuits can typically only provide about a single order of magnitude power savings over traditional CMOS -- they still have resistive losses, they just follow a slightly different equation (f²RC²V², vs. fCV²). But RC and C are figures of merit for a given silicon process, and fRC (a dimensionless figure) is constrained by the operational principles of digital logic to the order of 0.1, which in turn constrains the power savings to that order of magnitude regardless of process. Where you can find excess savings though is simply by reducing operating frequency. Adiabatic circuits benefit more from this than traditional CMOS. Which is great if you're building something like a GPU which can trade clock frequency for core count.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notably the physical limit ishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principleit doesn't necessarily take any energy at all to process information,  but it does take roughly kT work of energy to erase a bit of information.  It's related tohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demonas,  to complete cycles,  the demon has to clear its memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Henry G. Baker wrote this paper titled "The Thermodynamics of Garbage Collection" in the 90s about linear logic, stack machines, reversibility and the cost of erasing information:https://wiki.xxiivv.com/docs/baker_thermodynamics.htmlA subset of FRACTRAN programs are reversible, and I would love to see rewriting computers as a potential avenue for reversible circuit building(similar to the STARAN cpu):https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html#reversibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660606</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've enjoyed using ffmpeg 1000% more since I was able to stop doing manually the tedious task of Googling for Stack Overflow answers and cobbling them into a command and got Chat GPT to write me commands instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me I need to publish my write up on how I've been converting digitized home video tapes into clips using scene detection, but in case anyone is googling for it, here's a gist I landed on that does a good job of it [0] but sometimes it's fooled by e.g. camera flashes or camera shake so I need to give it a start and end file and have ffmpeg concatenate them back together [1]Weird thing is I got better performance without "-c:v h264_videotoolbox" on latest Mac update, maybe some performance regression in Sequoia? I don't know. The equivalent flag for my windows machine with Nvidia GPU is "-c:v h264_nvenc" . I wonder why ffmpeg doesn't just auto detect this? I get about 8x performance boost from this. Probably the one time I actually earned my salary at work was when we were about to pay out the nose for more cloud servers with GPU to process video when I noticed the version of ffmpeg that came installed on the machines was compiled without GPU acceleration ![0] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nielsbom/c86c504fa5fd61ae...[1] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jazzyjackson/bf9282df0a40...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten pretty good at various bits of ffmpeg over time.  Its CLI has a certain logic to it... it's order dependent (not all unix CLIs are).Lately, I've been playing around with more esoteric functionality.  For example, storing raw video straight off a video camera on a fairly slow machine.  I built a microscope and it reads frames off the camera at 120FPS in raw video format (YUYV 1280x720) which is voluminous if you save it directly to disk (gigs per minute).  Disks are cheap but that seemed wasteful, so I was curious about various close-to-lossless techniques to store the exact images, but compressed quickly.  I've noticed that RGB24 conversion in ffmpeg is extremely slow, so instead after playing around with the command line I ended up with:  ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuyv422 -s 1280x720 -i test.raw  -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p  movie.mp4 -crf 13 -y

This reads in raw video- because raw video doesn't have a container, it lacks metadata like "pixel format" and "image size", so I have to provide those.  It's order dependent- everything before  "-i test.raw" is for decoding the input, and everythign after is for writing the output.  I do one tiny pixel format conversion (that ffmpeg can do really fast) and then write the data out in a very, very close to lossless format with a container (I've found .mkv to be the best container in most cases).Because I hate command lines, I ended up using ffmpeg-python which composes the command line from this:  self.process = (
            ffmpeg.
            input(
                "pipe:",
                format="rawvideo",
                pix_fmt="yuyv422",
                s="{}x{}".format(1280, 720),
                threads=8
            )
            .output(
                fname, pix_fmt="yuv422p", vcodec="libx264", crf=13 
            )  
            .overwrite_output()
            .global_args("-threads", "8")
            .run_async(pipe_stdin=True)
            )

and then I literally write() my frames into the stdin of that process.  I had to limit the number of threads because the machine has 12 cores and uses at least 2 at all times to run the microscope.I'm still looking for better/faster lossless YUV encoding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Servo" is a control method. You can control steppers using servo methods and it's pretty good actually. There are chinese encoder boards that'll do everything for like $10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a unusual servo. Servos usually have a small optical encoder that emits quadrature pulses as it rotates. That's immune to magnetic interference but can potentially miss counts. This servo seems to have an magnetic analog position sensor. Something like this.[1] Can't miss counts but has less noise immunity.[1] https://www.analog.com/en/products/adaf1080.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm gonna experiment with adding hall effect sensors to a standard servo to make a cheap feedback mechanism since those are pretty cheap nowadays seems like. Steppers still have a place but for hobby stuff with basic "what pos is it" this could be something I use a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697335</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After years in the making ZFS raidz expansaion is finally here.Major features added in release:  - RAIDZ Expansion: Add new devices to an existing RAIDZ pool, increasing storage capacity without downtime.

  - Fast Dedup: A major performance upgrade to the original OpenZFS deduplication functionality.

  - Direct IO: Allows bypassing the ARC for reads/writes, improving performance in scenarios like NVMe devices where caching may hinder efficiency.

  - JSON: Optional JSON output for the most used commands.

  - Long names: Support for file and directory names up to 1023 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just don't get it how the Windows world - by far the largest PC platform per userbase - still doesn't have any answer to ZFS. Microsoft had WinFS and then ReFS but it's on the backburner and while there is active development (Win11 ships some bits time to time) release is nowhere in sight. There are some lone warriors trying the giant task of creating a ZFS compatibility layer with some projects, but they are far from being mature/usable.How come that Windows still uses a 32 year old file system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good to see that they were pretty conservative about the expansion.Not only is expansion completely transparent and resumable, it also maintains redundancy throughout the process.That said, there is one tiny caveat people should be aware of:&gt; After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distributed among the larger set of disks. New blocks will be written with the new data-to-parity
ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694596</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For 2 years I built RAG apps for clients. They are not Code-Assistants but everytime I see code assistants solely relying on embeddings to find the right pieces as context, it feels wrong to me:Code is very well structured. Based on a starting point (current cursor, current file, or results of an embedding search result) you would probably fair better to traverse the code tree up and down building a tree or using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) as described in this blog post [4]. It's like a tree search in order to get relevant code pieces for a certain task, and it imitates what human coders do. It would integrate well into an agent loop to search relevant code.Aren't there any open source code assistants and plugins that do this? All I see are embedding searches for the big projects such as cursor, cline or continue.All I ever found were a few research efforts such as RepoGraph [1], CodeGraph [2] and one one codebase open sourced by Deutsche Telekom called advanced-coding-assistant [3]1 https://github.com/ozyyshr/RepoGraph2 https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.138633 https://github.com/telekom/advanced-coding-assistant-backend4 https://cyrilsadovsky.substack.com/p/advanced-coding-chatbot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand why we have so many companies working on vector databases when the real value is in fine tuned embeddings. Having recently evaluated vector DB’s to handle 100M+ nodes, everything will run you  $1 - 8k per month. Yet using embeddings fine tuned on a specific use case, will lower that 10X since you can get away with way coarser vectors.This makes so much intuitive sense - voyage please release an insurance focused model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently using voyage for my project for the following reasons:1. They are recommended by Anthropic on their docs2. They're focused on embeddings as a service, I somehow prefer this other than spread-thin large orgs like OpenAI, GoogleAI, etc.3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently the main attack facing Firefox is coming from advertising companies such as YouTube.It’s crazy to think that some software engineers might actually intentionally degrade user experience on non-Google browsers or for people using adblockers. The mentality here is pretty disturbing: it’s almost like punishing users for making the choice to browse the web without ads, or without the surveillance mechanisms that come with them. Instead of building a better experience, these engineers seem to be focused on sabotaging alternatives in the name of profit or control. The kind of mindset behind this reeks of the same tactics we see in some ad networks or big tech companies - if we can’t convince you to opt in, we’ll make sure you’re inconvenienced or frustrated until you do.It’s a dangerous precedent because it introduces a toxic game of cat-and-mouse, where the user is constantly playing defense, trying to protect themselves from deliberate misdirection. It’s not just an ethical concern, but also an issue of how we value user autonomy in the digital space.For the hackers out there, this is a opportunity to dig into the JavaScript code responsible for this. There’s almost certainly some interesting obfuscation or odd behavior hiding in the code, and by pulling it apart, we can both understand how these tactics work and build tools or methods to counteract them. Let’s make sure the only thing that slows down the web is bad design or slow servers, not malicious code aimed at punishing the user for making their own choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the closest we have to a browser not controlled by the corporate giants.
Sometimes Mozilla makes unpopular choices and people raise a stink about it, but we do that because we hold them to a higher standard. With Microsoft and Google, we just expect them to Do More Evil, with Mozilla we expect Good and will complain loudly when they fail to uphold our principles, and we recommend Firefox because we feel like it is possible to expect Good from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using mozilla for _years_ it got shit, then better, then shit, and now its close enough.The thing I _Love_ is container tabs. I can isolate empires by using container tabs to sandbox cookies and other web state. This means that ebay doesn't change my adverts to the last thing I searched on every site, and autoplay embedded youtube doesn't fuck up my video recommendations.It means I can hide my work gmail from my home, and separate search histories (although thats less relevant now with AI.)lastly, being able to scroll left and right on my tabs, rather than new ones being unaccesable is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696081</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article from Modal's GPU Glossary serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various terms and concepts related to GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). It provides clear definitions and explanations of technical jargon associated with GPU technology, including architecture, performance metrics, memory types, and applications in fields such as gaming, machine learning, and data visualization. The glossary aims to educate readers about GPU functionality, helping them make informed decisions whether they are professionals in the field or newcomers seeking to enhance their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weird part of the programming model is that threadblocks don't map 1:1 to warps or SMs. A single threadblock executes on a single SM, but each SM has multiple warps, and the threadblock could be the size of a single warp, or larger than the combined thread count of all warps in the SM.So, how large do you make your threadblocks to get optimal SM/warp scheduling? Well it "depends" based on resource usage, divergence, etc. Basically run it, profile, switch the threadblock size, profile again, etc. Repeat on every GPU/platform (if you're programming for multiple GPU platforms and not just CUDA, like games do). It's a huge pain, and very sensitive to code changes.People new to GPU programming ask me "how big do I make the threadblock size?" and I tell them go with 64 or 128 to start, and then profile and adjust as needed.Two articles on the AMD side of things:https://gpuopen.com/learn/occupancy-explainedhttps://gpuopen.com/learn/optimizing-gpu-occupancy-resource-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if this also included terms that are often used by Nvidia that apparently come from computer architecture (?) but are basically foreign to software engineers, like “scoreboard” or “math pipe”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really great work, suggest for a next post: the VRAM requirements estimation calculation for running models locally. Especially with different architecture and different Quants, it gets always confusing and even online calculators give different answer. I never found a really good deep dive on this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675529</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "death by a thousand cuts," which refers to the gradual and often unnoticed accumulation of small issues that may lead to significant problems over time. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing these minor issues early on to prevent larger failures in various aspects of life, including personal well-being, relationships, and organizational management. The piece encourages proactive measures and awareness to address small challenges before they escalate, advocating for a more mindful approach to handling difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a NixOS user and contributor.This post is fair.Nix is very flexible, and it hasn't yet stabilised on a firm set of recommendations for a happy path.Going on a whim:* Use nixos-unstable. It's defacto stable, and gets much more attention than nixos-stable.* Use flakes.* Don't use multiple versions of nixpkgs. In the rare case a package is failing to build, then raise an issue, or wait, or rollback.* On NixOS, don't use user profiles. They won't interop in the way OP hopes.* Only use nixpkgs. If you absolutely must use another flake, only use popular ones from https://github.com/nix-community.But until the community give opinionated suggestions, users will stray towards bad practices.(Also, no need to mix pipewire and jack. Pipewire can emulate jack.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that so much of the divide in the tech field is simply between the two camps of "the tools are the interesting part" vs "getting things done with the tools is the interesting part".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on the fence about Nix. I've wanted to love it (and do love the concept), but between the Waiting-for-Godot situation for flakes, the weird language, and the occasional political infighting I've seen pop up about the community, I still haven't switched.I'm no language expert, but I genuinely don't understand why it wouldn't have been better to build some equivalent DSL in Haskell to do this given the similar lazy nature of the language. DSL for most things, then open the hood and do actual Haskell for crazier use cases. I get that Nix started before Haskell became less academic and slightly more usable in the mainstream and has built up momentum, but the lack of tooling for understanding what is going wrong when incrementally building up a config is very confusing.I'd be curious if anyone has go to or from NixOS compared to declarative distros compared to the atomic distros like ublue [0] and has any thoughts. I'm a bit split about what to move to next (though my &gt;5 year Tumbleweed install on most of my machines is holding up no problem).[0] https://universal-blue.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666851</guid></item><item><title>16. 1 in 5 online job postings are either fake or never filled, study finds</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/1-in-5-online-job-postings-are-either-fake-or-never-filled-study-finds-2000549706</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;A recent study reveals that about 20% of online job postings are either fraudulent or remain unfilled, highlighting the prevalence of fake job ads in the digital job market. This issue can mislead job seekers, wasting their time and resources. The report emphasizes the need for greater transparency and verification processes in online job listings to protect applicants and improve the job search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been required to create fake job postings because of US immigration policy.From the line manager perspective, how it looks is you have a colleague who has been working with you for several years who is on a H1B visa. They want to get a green card and become a permanent resident. To support this, we are required to post a fake job ad for their position, and invent a reason to reject any US citizens who apply for the position. (Non-US applications are ignored.)Our legal advice was that the job posting had to be contain only legitimate requirements for the role, so it could not be highly tailored to only match the resume of the employee seeking PERM status. The result was phone screen interviews were required to reject 8-10 on-paper-potentially-qualified US applicants for the fake position.This is for a highly specialized area within finance, where in real hiring there is an immense effort to find the strongest candidates regardless of nationality.In hindsight I am confident that earlier in my career I had applied to at least one such fake role. One not-well-known advantage of working with a recruiter as a job seeker in such a field is the recruiter will have back-channel information to know to ignore such fake job postings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the rate of non-fill is higher. But the reasons for it are all over the map. Everything from "we always leave a posting up even when we're not really looking just in case the perfect candidate happens to walk through the door" but in the mean time nobody really pays attention to applicants, to "we weren't getting the applicants we wanted with this posting, so we took it down and are trying a new posting," to "we're legally obligated to post this, but we already have a plan about hiring" whether it's someone connected, someone internal, or a preference for H1B workers, to all kinds of other scenarios. Anybody who has ever applied for a dozen jobs, sent literate applications and outreach, and has heard from most of them never to months later regardless of actual fit for the job knows this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've posted this story before, but it's relevant.About two years ago, I was looking for a job, and a recruiter reached out about a software engineering position at a prominent newspaper [1].I told the recruiter to apply me, they did, and they made me sit through a two hour video course on ethics and sexual harassment, which was weird considering that I hadn't even done an interview yet.About a week later, the recruiter gets back to me, and they declined me because  my resume "reads too much like a manager, no hands-on coding experience".I was extremely confused, because most of the time people say the opposite, that my resume is too in the weeds, and I need to focus on high-level stuff. Moreover, I don't have any managerial experience on my resume...every role says something like "software engineer".And then it hit me: the hiring manager never read my resume. He already knew who he wanted to hire for the role, and for either legal or compliance or bureaucratic reasons, he had to make it look like he was looking for other candidates, and in the process, he wasted my time and the recruiter's.[1] Not going to say which one but you've definitely heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article advocates for a decentralized social media landscape, emphasizing that platforms like Mastodon empower users to own their online interactions rather than relying on centralized corporate entities. It discusses the importance of user independence and the benefits of community-led moderation, encouraging a shift towards federated networks where individuals have more control over the content and connections they engage with. The piece underscores the idea that social media should serve the public good, fostering spaces where diverse voices can thrive without the risk of being silenced by profit-driven motives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm impressed by Eugen. Giving up full ownership is absolutely the right thing to do. But most people in this situation would become too greedy and start rationalizing why they should be in control (benevolent dictator). Hats off! Mastodon is heading in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon is on the right track. They’ve been doing so much right, the UX has improved considerably.I think there’s some mainstream appeal, but there are also ecosystem issues that aren’t solved easily, as well as a lack of algorithmic curation, which a lot of people deem very important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; lack of algorithmic curationThey can get that elsewhere. Mastodon will never win that battle. It's not wrong to want algorithms feeding you content, it's just that Mastodon will always be like the tenth best option for those users, and they always will be. Mastodon's advantage is with users that don't want posts written for algorithms. (I used Twitter that way for many years, but when they killed off Tweetdeck I visited less and less, to the point that I just don't often go there any longer.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681976</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a detailed introduction to structured log probabilities in the context of machine learning and natural language processing. It discusses the concept of log probabilities, emphasizing their importance for understanding model predictions and improving performance in tasks such as sequence generation. The site includes technical explanations, examples, and discussions on implementation, aimed at helping practitioners and researchers utilize structured log probabilities effectively in their work. It serves as a resource for understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

Somehow I didn't realize that logprobs were being returned as part of the OAI requests, and I really like this application of it.Any interest in seeing this sort of thing being added to llama.cpp?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was under the impression that log probabilities don't work like that / they aren't really useful to be interpreted as probabilities?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684629&gt; the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698753</guid></item><item><title>22.

When Pyiodide came out I was excited but it was a bit difficult to use, this looks and feels fantastic.I really like Observable as well, but I've found it difficult to find robust and broad numerical libraries in javascript like what Python has.I would love for this type of tool to redefine how we do science. It would be amazing if many scientific papers included both their data and the code in an interactive environment with zero installs and configuration. Plus when discussing a paper you could "fork" it and explore different analysis options live which for many fields would be totally feasible to do in the browser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700852</guid></item><item><title>23.

https://web.archive.org/web/20240919110243/https://www.sdf.c...In December 2024 the page had been updated to now compare "dbt Core" against "SDF with dbt":
https://web.archive.org/web/20241217172451/https://www.sdf.c...Little marketing switcharoo there to avoid pissing off their future owners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats to the SDF team for their exit.Alas, dbt Labs has developed a reputation for rug pulling functionality from dbt Core and gating most of their differentiating features behind dbt Cloud. I cannot see this type of consolidation being in the best interest of the dbt community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious if this product actually works because I was beating my head against almost exactly this very recently.I haven't checked yet, but is SDF schema-dependent? For some reason, all sql comprehending/transforming tools I can find are either too trivial to be useful or require an exact schema to operate, both of which are too brittle to be useful when I try to use them in anger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697764</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub status page details an incident that occurred, specifically an issue affecting certain functionalities of GitHub services. The incident began on a specific date and time and is accompanied by updates on its progress, including when the issue was detected, actions taken by the team to resolve it, and the ultimate resolution. The page serves to keep users informed about service interruptions and the status of various GitHub features during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential at best but I work in a regulated industry and we're starting to get some heavy scrutiny from external auditors and regulators on the way we plan to address extended outages and forced exits from third party vendors.  This goes beyond basic DR/BCP and plans are reviewed with at least a high level scenario exercise.https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/09/2023-12...On the surface a product like managed git repos would seem to be relatively straightforward to deal with, but these same regulated firms are also under tremendous scrutiny for access management, change management, SDLC, etc etc.  They also have a huge software footprint which just increases the impact.Self-hosting is obviously the traditional answer, but that's not exactly a simple one either.Just an interesting problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's almost as if only Git is distributed, but people sold out to Github for convenience. Too bad Git lacks a distributed bug tracker and wiki system like Fossil. Guess Github has to fail a lot more for things to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was down for ~2 hours. The status website claims "degraded performance", but in reality we get    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

Either GitHub didn't know how to communicate, or they were not sure about the real impact.This is bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42691184</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;Recent research from Oak Ridge National Laboratory highlights that global plant uptake of carbon dioxide has increased by nearly one-third over the past several decades. This rise in CO2 absorption is attributed to various factors, including climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and shifts in land use. The study emphasizes the significance of understanding how plants respond to increasing CO2, as this could have implications for carbon management strategies and climate mitigation efforts. The findings suggest that while plants are currently absorbing more CO2, future changes in climate and land use could affect this capacity, necessitating ongoing research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"rises by nearly one third" sounds a bit strange to me, more correct would be "Plant CO2 uptake is currently underestimated by one third according to new research"?&gt; The research, detailed in the journal Nature, is expected to improve Earth system simulations that scientists use to predict the future climate, and spotlights the importance of natural carbon sequestration for greenhouse gas mitigation.Too bad that we are currently doing the exact opposite (cutting down more forest than is regrown)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of change is deeply worrying, because on the face of it, it implies means estimates of climate change are potentially rather unsound - such large changes in mechanisms central to change - and so climate change could be much worse than we expect.If climate change isn't so bad, then phew, but if it's actually worse, then we are in even more deadly trouble than we already are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As I understand the article; it’s not that we found out that they’ve _started_ absorbing more CO2; it’s that the previous estimations were flawed and we have new, improved ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696517</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the phenomenon of MrBeast, a prominent YouTuber known for his extravagant philanthropic stunts and challenges. It explores the cultural impact of his content, analyzing how he engages with audiences and the broader implications of his wealth and influence in online media. The piece discusses the mechanics behind his success, including his unique approach to storytelling, the dynamics of virality, and the interplay between entertainment and genuine charitable efforts. It raises questions about the ethics of such platforms and the nature of digital fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696691"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all – the essay is phenomenal and his book is available online for free – https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/youtube-apparatus/36...&gt; “Communication within the YouTube Apparatus has no meaning.” The rapid feedback loop between creators and audiences (as constructed by platform metrics) means that the system more and more responds to itself. Rather than trying to go somewhere (as is the case with political ideology), the creator seeks simply intensification, to draw more and more of the world into his whirlpool of content.This idea – that meaning is replaced by intensification – helps me understand a lot about the world today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran a YouTube channel seriously for a couple of years.  Chasing the whims of the algorithm contributed to burnout and now I only release one or two videos a year.My reason for starting a channel was to have a discussion around some of the projects I was working on that I found interesting.  This never materialized.  I never had a ton of engagement, but if I did most questions asked by viewers that are answered in the video.I monetized my videos and started making beer-money amounts of revenue.  I put more and more time into them but never gained traction. I had a few "evergreen" videos that would make maybe a thousand bucks a year, the rest of the videos hardly got any views at all.Eventually, I found myself making videos to feed the algorithm not because it was a project that I wanted to do.  This is where I had to stop.  I realized that I just don't like editing videos.My channel makes no revenue now because YouTube requires an upload schedule and shorts.  Mr Beast's job sounds awful to me. The videos I make now only get dozens to hundreds of views when they're published.  I mostly share them with friends and in online communities where the info contained might be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top of the heap (Mr Beast, Nastya, Ryan, etc), this is true:&gt; The ideal creator has no distance between themselves and their persona. They have been interpellated by audience metrics; their subjective experience already takes audience reactions into account.&gt; Or more simply, YouTubers are not “Creators” but Creations. Audiences, rationalized by the platform, and the vloggers who upload the videos those audiences consume are not separable either theoretically or empirically.It's pretty obvious, too, because these YouTubers have a distinct theme where their popularity is dependent on 1) the whims and algos of the platform on one side, and 2) the ability for their audience to care and relate to something pretty dang detached and irrelevant from their everyday lives (unboxing, aggressive acts of charity, etc).While you hear plenty (Most? All?) YouTubers complain about the ranking algorithms &amp; capriciousness of their overlord, I don't believe most channels are quite as vapid as those at the top of the heap.  Lots of deep subjective content, and lots of freaking annoying CapCut edits, but also a primary focus on meaningful content relevent to viewers.  These people may not be getting rich from their vlogging, but it's also not fair to call what most of them are doing "vlogging", either.  It's video-based short form content curation for a clearly identified audience.  Not remotely the same as how the big guns like Mr Beast have to view their work [where they're much more similar to a cable TV network or a commercial production company than an independent producer].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696691</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four thoughts:1. I've developed a analog-&gt;digital path for my kids. Before they can get a music player, they get a CD player. Before they get video games, they get board games. And then, for video games, before they get Super Mario Odyssey they get the original Super Mario Bros. Each of these "first they get" is a long period. Years long. Give them something that has limitations so they can truly explore it. Find the nooks and crannies of something. Make up their own weird little things within that limitation. And then, back to music, I want my kids to know what a musical album is, know how to savor the highs and the lows, how sometimes certain tracks mean more to you based on your mood or life-stage, then just an endless playlist of newness.2. The gorilla in the room is that most adults can barely handle online media.3. The other gorilla in the room is porn. Again, see #2.4. The classic philosophers placed Prudence as the queen of virtues. What is prudence? It is essentially the ability to grasp reality. Why did they say that was most important? Because you couldn't use any of the other virtues if your didn't have a good grasp of reality (e.g. fortitude would be foolhardiness if you ran into a ill-conceived death thinking you were being brave).You need to make sure you and your kids are able to grasp reality, not just the appearance of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our kids? Hell, my wife and I don't use social media, except in very limited doses for work reasons. Our kids have zero access to it and never will. Their device usage is kept at a minimum and used for mostly educational or quality conversational purposes.I hate how many people now, whenever we're around them everyone has their phones out scrolling through 30 sec videos. They want to show you things which aren't funny, aren't entertaining, aren't informative... it's damn near Idiocracy levels of content consumption.[Insert video of someone badly dancing with caption that says "me."]Personally, I find it bizarre and extremely boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've 4 kids, the youngest is 11.The rule in the house is; 1) no social media accounts until 13 and 2) one of your parents will be your 'friend' on that account.This is actually a pretty great expression of "kids keep you young."But, right now is right now and how kids communicate with each other is constantly changing - social media or not.So, if you're not a parent to a tween or teens now - I'd say you have little to actually worry about as the landscape will be completely different in a decade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683494</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;datalist is one I stumbled upon and blew me away. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/da...It's not a replacement for select as you still need an input to tie it to but it seems to handle filtering a list of options nicely.Also, if you have two selects with the same list in it, you can do it once with datalist and have two inputs, say a list of clients with client_a and client_b for inputs.I don't quite care for how it displays the value, like if you put the ID as the value and the client name in the option element, you can filter by the ID or the name but the input will show the ID only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trick to prevent scrolling by setting overflow: hidden unfortunately results in visual page jumping for me.The reason is I have macOS set up to always show scroll bars, instead of hiding them. At least one browser (I forget which, but I test on Safari, Firefox and Chrome) doesn’t have a disabled scroll bar but removes it altogether. This makes the page wider and causes it to reflow and move.Does anyone know how to keep the scroll bar onscreen, just not enabled?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a neat piece of modern CSS:  body:has(dialog[open]) {
    overflow: hidden;
  }

https://caniuse.com/css-has confirms the has() selector has had widespread browser support since December 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662265</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process and benefits of removing the pedals from a bicycle. It outlines the tools needed for the task, including a pedal wrench and an adjustable wrench, and provides a step-by-step guide to safely detach the pedals. The piece emphasizes the advantages of this action, such as making the bike easier to store, transport, or clean, and addresses common concerns, such as ensuring not to lose any small parts during the removal process. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for cyclists looking to optimize their bike's storage and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I taught my son to ride using training wheels. He rode around for a few days and asked me to take them off. So, I took them off. And when I came back outside from putting the tools and training wheels away, he was riding his bike as if he'd never not ridden it. I do like the author's idea however.By the way, did you know that the the right pedal is right hand thread, but the left pedal is left handed thread? If it wasn't, the left pedal, being right hand threaded, would come loose easily. And that was a Wright Brothers innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree with the point of this post. I'd never heard of balance bikes, and then my wife did some research when we had our first kid and found out about this.We've now taught both of our kids to bike by starting with a balance bike, and the comparison with their friends who learned with training wheels was amazing - the balance bike kids were zooming around earlier, confidently, and with many fewer spills than the training wheel cohort.Also, you can get a balance bike with a handbrake, which sets them up well for getting a bike with handbrakes instead of coaster brakes. Kids bikes in the US have to be sold with coasters but there are several manufacturers (like woom) who make it really easy to remove the coaster and have front and rear hand brakes.Also also, most kids bikes in the US are too heavy: they're tough and cheap but it makes it hard to control them. Woom and Isla and probably a few others now make aluminum frame bikes for kids that are much more appropriate weight for their sizes, though at a bit of a cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how I teach people to drive stick, and they’ll learn within 30 minutes.
Put them on an empty road with a downward slope. The car will roll on its own, without them having to use the gas pedal. Then they can just practice switching into first without the risk of stalling.
After a few times integrate using the gas pedal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697467</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I turned out OK in public school, but I was held back at different points, particularly in math, because I (and a few others) were too far ahead of the other kids. We literally had to repeat an entire year of content at one point. Kudos to the teachers who enabled &amp; fostered that, but shame on the school system for not continuing to support. I'm pretty sure one of my classmates gave up on academics at that moment (he never really excelled again like he used to).I'd like my kids to be free to follow their curiosities.  It's definitely work to homeschool but for us, it may be worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved public school (class of 99). I still miss the style of learning. Can you imagine going deep on a topic for 50 minutes then switching? AP classes got double periods. I found it so refreshing and I learned a ton.Eg, science, math, study hall, lunch, Spanish, History, Art, English… in a single day?I loved it. What worked for me was studying for tests — and the harder the classes you took, the less homework there was (or it wasn’t required). I had a great history teacher, occasionally good math &amp; English teachers, a great art teacher, and mediocre science teachers. The science TEXTBOOKS were fabulous — you could just read through those things and become a genius.No more textbooks these days — it’s all some pdf segment to download. Bummer for my kids.These days, there are way fewer tests, so my kids always freak when they have tests. I thought tests were great! Just one focused period to perform and then move on. Homework and projects were a big problem for me, because I could never start early enough — it was always a last minute dash. Maybe that trained me to produce fast output, though.Kids were sometimes awful, but there was no way I was going to be popular so I just did my nerd thing. There were enough of us.They had a great drama program which I loved — I did every play and musical I could. And they even had a speech and debate club — so I competed at “extemporaneous” speech—when I went to state competitions, they got the students all together to clap me out like they’d do for the football team. That was unnecessary and funny for the nerd.My kids don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I fear. I was pretty lucky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK I guess I’m going to go against the deluge of comments here; And give an appreciable reason instead of denigrating those who might choose this.The context, though, I am British. I grew up in Britain. I went to British school.I can’t speak universally about my experience, (even within all of Britain), because it’s my experience which is in one small area of the country.However, school, for me, was by far the single worst mandatory system I have been exposed to in my life. For the entirety of my young life, school was a prison. With inmates who would beat you, Emotionally abuse you, the “wardens” did not want to be there either, and did not care how the other inmates treated you… sometimes doubling down on the behaviour themselves. - The comparison is further solidified by 6-foot galvanised steel bars surrounding the complex, and that I visited an actual psychiatric prison not long after and the cafeteria, recreational grounds, rooms, etc; were identical to those of my school.Education? You probably mean repeating exercises in rote? You likely mean memorisation? That’s not education.It took becoming an adult to learn for myself that I enjoyed learning. My school was not learning, Everything that got me through school was things that my mother taught me- And as a consequence, I was always top of my class.I find it hard to think of school as anything more than forced internment for children while their parents go to work, with exercises designed to keep you busy more than to give a functional understanding. I would not be surprised if this feeling is shared among many of my generation and social class, the endless chasing of metrics has made even the tiniest amount of joy that could exist in school- Non-existent.and for those saying it was good for socialisation with other children- The ostracised, are learning to be helpless and to be victims- They are not learning to “socialise” more. If anything it is probably more harmful for those people to be exposed to more people until they’ve had time to form on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698737</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of database management systems (DBMS) for businesses and how they help in storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. It highlights the various types of DBMS, such as relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases, and emphasizes the need for organizations to choose the right system based on their specific requirements and use cases. The piece also touches on trends in database technology, including cloud databases and the growing importance of data analytics, underscoring the critical role that databases play in modern data-driven decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I so badly wish we could change a big Windows business application to use PostgreSQL rather than Microsoft SQL Server just because of the licensing costs. 
SQL Server is a fantastic product, but restricted to 128GB RAM and a few CPU cores or you have to start paying so much, that not even our biggest customers can justify it.Migration isn't easy, as this venerable application uses ADO.NET Datasets with TableAdapters and plenty of stored procedures. The syntax is almost compatible though. But not enough unfortunately.For our next product, we're sure to bet on PostgreSQL instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turns out Postgres Is Enough: https://gist.github.com/cpursley/c8fb81fe8a7e5df038158bdfe0f...(Gist contains a bunch of Postgres ecosystems things, if anything is missing, please let me know)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After coming back to coding after ~10-15 years away, databases are IMHO the most improved element of the dev/devops experience.Managed Postgres on Google Cloud is a fantastic product (I'm sure other cloud's offerings are also similarly good). Backups, replication, point-in-time recovery, managed updates, plus quick &amp; easy system &amp; query insight tooling. All for less than £1/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696080</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the release of Shepherd 1.0.0, a service manager designed for the GNU operating system, highlighting its new features and improvements. It discusses enhancements such as improved performance, better support for systemd services, and updated documentation. The release is a significant step towards robustness and usability in managing services, emphasizing the project’s commitment to free software. The blog post also encourages users to try the new version and provides links for downloading and further information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shepherd is a wonderful little service manager. The project has been integrating the good features of systemd (socket activation, timers, etc.) while retaining the hackability of using a fully featured programming language for configuration. Been happily using it with Guix for over a decade!NLnet has funded a really cool project to turn Shepherd into a distributed system that enables a fleet of Shepherds to cooperate. https://nlnet.nl/project/DistributedShepherd/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a quick look at this, the first thing I notice is that the configuration file syntax is obtuse and nigh-illegible unless you already know what things are, and even then it's cumbersome and looks frustrating to write.e.g. instead of systemd's simple:    Exec=/path/to/ntpd -n -c /etc/ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g

We have this mess:    #:start (make-forkexec-constructor
           (list "…/bin/ntpd"
                 "-n" "-c" "/…/…-ntpd.conf" "-u" "ntpd" "-g")
           #:log-file "/var/log/ntpd.log")

They say you don't need to be an expert on guile scheme to build a service file, but it does seem as though you need to know things like what `'(ntpd)` means, which I assumed was some kind of identifier literal, and it seems to be what's called a 'data literal' in scheme, but I had to google to discover that since the actual guile scheme documentation didn't seem to explain that syntax at all.I get that there are benefits to being able to do more advanced scripting in a service file, but this seems like a classic example of programmers writing things for programmers and not for users (or at least, not for users who don't 'get it').Going to chalk this up as another 'GNU reimplemented something badly because of NIH syndrome' incident and move on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that don't know, GNU Shepherd is an init system (like systemd) written in Guile (a LISP), the unit files are written with Guile too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698981</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Rise and Fall of the English Sentence" explores the evolution of English sentence structure, examining how it has changed over the centuries from elaborate constructions to more simplified forms. It discusses the impact of various linguistic influences, the societal shifts affecting language use, and the tension between traditional grammar rules and modern communication styles. Ultimately, the piece reflects on how these changes affect clarity and expression in contemporary writing, suggesting that while language continues to evolve, a balance between innovation and adherence to grammatical standards is essential for effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fun to read letters written by children in the 18th century, as it gives you a little glimpse into what it was like to learn to write at this level of complexity, and what aspects of written language children were being taught to master.Here for example is a letter from John Quincy Adams to his father, written when he was ten:&gt;DEAR SIR,—I love to receive letters very well; much better than I love to write them. I make but a poor figure at composition, my head is too fickle, my thoughts are running after birds eggs play and trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma has a troublesome task to keep me steady, and I own I am ashamed of myself. [...] If I can but keep my resolution, I will write again at the end of the week and give a better account of myself. I wish, Sir, you would give me some instructions, with regard to my time, and advise me how to proportion my Studies and my Play, in writing, and I will keep them by me, and endeavor to follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a present determination of growing better, yours.&gt;P. S.—Sir, if you will be so good as to favor me with a Blank Book, I will transcribe the most remarkable occurances I meet with in my reading, which will serve to fix them upon my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constructing elegant, deeply nested sentences is an art in English as well as German (my first language).  But it is an art, more for connoisseurs than those who really need to communicate.An art that I appreciate more is at the opposite end.  Constructing elegant prose out of relatively simple sentences, like Ernest Hemingway."He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat."Long sentences for sure, but is there any nesting in there at all?  I can't see any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're confused by the glaring bracket-matching errors in the opening quotation, it is missing two left brackets at the start of the sentence and three right brackets at the end of the sentence. That would correctly balance and nest the bracket pairs and bring the total number of clauses to 8, as described in the first paragraph.I wonder if the missing brackets are an artifact of some weird automated typesetting/rendering or if an editor who never bothered to read the article came through and said, "Quotations shouldn't start and end with random brackets!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695580</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the prompt describing the function call parameters:When calling the automation, you need to provide three main parameters:
 1. Title (title):
A brief descriptive name for the automation. This helps identify it at a glance. For example, "Check for recent news headlines".
 2. Prompt (prompt):
The detailed instruction or request you want the automation to follow. For example:
"Search for the top 10 headlines from multiple sources, ensuring they are published within the last 48 hours, and provide a summary of any recent Russian military strikes in the Lviv Oblast."
 3. Schedule (schedule):
This uses the iCalendar (iCal) VEVENT format to specify when the automation should run. For example, if you want it to run every day at 8:30 AM, you might provide:BEGIN:VEVENT  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTOptionally, you can also include:
 • DTSTART (start time):
If you have a specific starting point, you can include it. For example:BEGIN:VEVENT  
DTSTART:20250115T083000  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTIn summary, the call typically includes:
 • title (string): A short name.
 • prompt (string): What you want the automation to do.
 • schedule (string): The iCal VEVENT defining when it should run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon had an insane number of people working on just the alarms feature in Alexa when they interviewed me for a position years ago. They had entire teams devoted to the tiniest edge case within the realm of scheduling things with Alexa. This is no doubt one of the biggest use cases in computing: getting your computer to tell you what to do at a given time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The beta is inconsistently showing (required a few refreshes to get something to show up), but my limited usage of it showed a plethora of issues:- Assumed UTC instead of EST. Corrected it and it still continued to bork- Added random time deltas to my asked times (+2, -10 min).- Couple notifications didn't go off at all- The one that did go off didn't provide a push notification.---On top of that, only usable without search mode. In search mode, it was totally confused and gave me a Forbes article.Seems half baked to me.Doing scheduled research behind the scenes or sending a push notification to my phone would be cool, but surprised they thought this was OK for a public beta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704795</guid></item><item><title>43.

Ironically, it felt easier at my previous job as employee in a startup: work during office hours, open-source on the side.Now I spend my free time playing my Fender and exploring ways to combine music with programming, maybe using LLMs for copilot performances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello, and thank you for creating Glicol—it’s an outstanding tool for live coding and audio synthesis!I was wondering about the possibility of extending Glicol’s functionality to include features such as:TTS Emotional Replication
Generating human-like emotional expressions in sound (e.g., sighs, coughs, gasps).
Sound Effects Simulation
Creating realistic environmental sounds, such as thunder, rain, wind, and other ambient effects.
Novel Sound Creation
Enabling the generation of entirely new and experimental sounds, potentially by training on a provided audio dataset.
Given Glicol’s modular architecture, Rust-based engine, and WebAssembly (WASM) support, I’m curious whether it would be theoretically possible to support such extensions within the current framework.Questions
Are any of these features currently possible with Glicol?
If not, are there any plans or ongoing developments to enable functionality like this in the future?
I believe these additions could expand Glicol’s applications far beyond music generation, opening up exciting possibilities in areas like:TTS systems with nuanced emotional expression.
Sound design for games, films, and interactive media.
Experimental audio research and creative sound exploration.
Before concluding, I’d like to add that Glicol’s potential use cases could extend well beyond music generation, offering new opportunities for innovation in audio-based applications.I’d love to hear your thoughts on this and whether these ideas align with Glicol’s future vision. Thank you for your time and for developing such an inspiring platform!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660619</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of stigmergy, a mechanism of indirect communication and coordination observed in social insects like ants, and how this principle could improve programming practices and software development. It argues that, unlike ants, programmers often lack the ability to effectively collaborate and self-organize in a way that enhances productivity and innovation. By integrating aspects of stigmergy into programming methodologies, the author suggests that developers can create more robust systems and collaborate more efficiently, ultimately leading to better outcomes in software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sites down, but do ants have standups every day just to tell the team what they are doing?  Are they forced to attend scrum ceremonies?  Do they have a scrum master insisting they set an arbitrary "sprint goal" every two weeks that everyone, including the scrum master, is going to forget about but management will frown at when they realize we didn't work towards?  Oh, I'd love to be able to produce like an ant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm personally attracted to this way of thinking. I did write a post about it many years ago, probably triggered by this article:https://ole-laursen.blogspot.com/2016/01/stimergy.htmlPart of the mindset is that when you see a co-worker end up in the wrong place with some new code, you ask yourself, can I do something to our code base to lower the probability of it happening again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why Can't Programmers Be More Like Ants?Because ants dont have business units. Most of us, programmers, are slaves to the business and we have to do what they want from us, not what we want or think is optimal to do. And the requirements can change often. How fast those changes would be notified by others in decentralized "ants approach"? Would the business survive with this approach?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673465</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of specific urban design choices on pedestrian safety, particularly in college towns. It highlights how certain intersections can become hazardous due to poor planning, lack of proper signage, ineffective traffic signals, or other structural issues. The piece emphasizes the need for better urban infrastructure to protect vulnerable road users, advocating for community involvement and policy changes to create safer environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a pedestrian I will take a busy light controlled intersection with a pedestrian scramble type walk signal over a busy 4-way stop where every single time.With the 4-way stop there is never a time in the cycle when all traffic is stopped.  The drivers who are present are continuously paying attention to what other drivers are doing which robs them of situational awareness to note pedestrians.  You can try and time it but that's risky.  With the walk signal there is a brief moment in time when the drivers are doing nothing but waiting for you and are all stopped so you as a pedestrian can account for them in preparation just before you get your signal and make your move.The author can get lost with this sort of textbook correct but questionable in reality take.  Legally having the right of way doesn't make you any less dead when the driver who's got three other drivers to pay attention to doesn't see you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I captured two drivers ripping through red lights in that short spanVideo actually shows two cars entering the intersection on yellow lights, which is legal. The rest of the article seems similarly exaggerated.----Edit: For those who disagree, please be aware that the stop lines are out of frame, so both cars are already in the intersection before they're visible on the video. You can get a better picture of what the intersection actually looks like here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/L37hZyvXs8BeWmFE8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a solved problem and it's astonishing the world hasn't just adopted the Dutch traffic engineering standards outright. It's FASTER for cars and safer for people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698557</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what I call meta advice.He makes most of the money now from persuading others starting a passive income side gig, for which he coincidentally has a starter pack to sale.  While this might be a reliable income, it is in no means a template for other people to start a successful passive income business with a working business idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an off-the-cuff summary:First you have to make space in your life for it. You need long blocks of time for deep work.The first idea you pick is unlikely to work, so pick something and start moving. Many of the best products come out of working on something else.When building, optimize for speed. Try to get something out in the world as quickly as possible and iterate from there.Pick a tech stack you're familiar with, that you'll be fastest in.Try to spend half your time on marketing/sales, even if you hate it.The most important skill you can have is resiliance. Not giving up is the best path to success. This is hard because there is so much uncertainty in this career path.It's worth it! The autonomy and freedom are unmatched by any other career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When my life was falling apart and I was trying to fix my relationship with my ex she dictated that we spend 'quality' time together which meant watching horrible reality TV while she was on insta on her phone.Out of mind numbing boredom I made a system for SEO spam websites during this time. I would take expiring domain names (so names someone had gone to the trouble to research but been unable to make work) parse out keywords and lookup popularity for them, lookup ad rates for them, and spit out names to buy and make a SEO spam site for (goal was 300 websites making $1 a day or $100k a year), or good names to domain squat. If a domain turned out bunk I threw my link-spam-network software on it to provide linkbacks to my money/new sites. I made around 30k profit a year plus another $5k selling domain names doing this before life fell further apart and it rotted on the vine. I was really tempted to sell it as a package but could never bring myself that low even deep in addiction. Plus Google started cracking down on that trash.I still think the concept of 300 somethings (though please not SEO spam) that make a dollar a day is viable for us here though because we're in the unique position where the creation/maintenance is just a matter of our spare time since we can do the specs/design/coding/administration/maintenance/etc ourselves. It seems like there are still people doing this. Look at new car model forums. Everytime a new car models is released there's a rush to create discussion forums for that model with people hoping Google blesses theirs so they can add it to their portfolio of money maker car model forums. Maybe the secret sauce is forcing yourself to watch reality TV until your mind rebels and says 'fine, grab me the laptop and we'll make mind numbingly boring software products as that is at least better than watching this'.Edit: To clarify this wasn't my income source this was just what I did while being forced to watch 'The Kardashians' for bonding time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696822</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is refreshing in its research and writing: the research is crude, testing just a very few alternatives - just enough for something to write about. And that's okay, this is not a scientific paper. And then the author collects a few quotes and does not dilute things too much. Good job.I propose another workaround alternative that doesn't exist yet. A "multi-browser" which lets you browse and visually diff the web from different points of view. See the web from deep china, europe, Kansas City, San Francisco, Chrome, Firefox, daytime and nighttime, incognito, logged-in, etc all at once (modulo some time spreading for opsec or something) so we can get back to peace and what matters: booking a bloody hotel room or reading a magazine article without making a project of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic pricing is the future of everything. If consumers are willing to pay 1.5x, you are leaving money on the table by only charging x. In fact in a fully optimized system, once consumers have all of their wants and needs met, they will have zero dollars left over. (Expensive end of life care tends to have similar results today.)NPR did a piece on it last year which to me came off a bit too cheerful.https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1197958433/dynamic-pricing-gr...Using only time of day is fairly primitive, though. We can do better. With facial recognition, we can probably personalize prices to the penny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My wife and I travel a lot as a hobby.

I would even go farther and say that almost everything is automatable depending on how much effort you're willing to put into it. However, lots of bad or overwhelmed devops shops I've consulted seem to be stuck in this insane hell-loop of manual processes not ever giving them "time" or "priority" to automate some of these processes and get them off the treadmill. Usually it takes a fair amount of heroics to get out of that, but I have  specific approach to such situations that I've been using successfully for a few years now.it's always important to remember "devops" is a completely loaded term that can mean drastically different things depending on organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682660</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains why the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, operates over a very short range. It discusses the role of W and Z bosons, which mediate this force and are responsible for processes like beta decay. The article attributes the short-range characteristic to the large mass of these bosons compared to other particles, which results in a rapid decrease in force strength at distances greater than the size of atomic nuclei. The piece also highlights the implications of this force in particle physics and its importance in understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this "explanation" just shift the question to what is stiffness?  Like it refactored the question but didn't actually explain it.Previously, we had statement "the weak force is short range".  In order to explain it, we had to invent a new concept "stiffness" that is treated as a primitive and not explained in terms of other easy primitives, and then we get to "accurately" say that the weak force is short due to stiffness.I grant the OP that stiffness might be hard to explain, but then why not just say "the weak force is short range -- and just take that as an axiom for now".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes me skeptical here is that the author claims that fields have a property that is necessary to explain this, and yet physicists have not given that property a name, so he has to invent one (“stiffness”). If the quantity appears in equations, I find it hard to believe that it was never given a name. Can anyone in the field of physics elucidate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting video essay by the Huygens Optics channel where some simulations of these field effects are considered.Turning Waves Into Particles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP5Pbx8I4sAnd if unfamiliar, that channel constantly delivers high quality thought provoking content on the nature of light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669906</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the outcome of operations performed on the plaintext. The website discusses its significance in preserving data privacy while enabling the processing of sensitive information, highlighting its applications in cloud computing, healthcare, and finance. It also covers the different types of homomorphic encryption, such as partially, somewhat, and fully homomorphic encryption, along with the challenges and ongoing research in enhancing its efficiency and practicality for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

You want to make search work like magic in the Photos app, so the user can find all their “dog” pictures with ease.What if you're a user and you don't care about searching for "dog" in your own photos, you might not even use the Photos app, but apple still scans all your photos and sends data off device without asking you?Perhaps this complicated dance works, perhaps they have made no mistakes, perhaps no one hacks or coerces the relay host providers... they could still have just asked for consent the first time you open Photos (if you ever do) before starting the scan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its using Concrete from Zama.I didn't like their license because it's BSD-3-Clause-Clear but then they state:"Zama’s libraries are free to use under the BSD 3-Clause Clear license only for development, research, prototyping, and experimentation purposes. However, for any commercial use of Zama's open source code, companies must purchase Zama’s commercial patent license"So Its not free, you need to pay for patent license, and they don't disclose how much.I recommend OpenFHE as an alternative Free open source solution. 
I know its C++ and not Rust, but no patent license and it can do the same thing the blog post wants to do, it even has more features like proxy-reencryption that I think Concrete can't do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;     The two hops, the two companies, are already acting in partnership, so what is there technically in the relay setup to stop the two companies from getting together—either voluntarily or at the secret command of some government—to compare notes, as it were, and connect the dots?The OHTTP scheme does not _technically_ prevent this.
It increases the number parties need to cooperate to extract this information, hoping it would be caught somewhere in the pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666959</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of cosine similarity as a measure for comparing documents or vectors in machine learning and natural language processing. It highlights inherent flaws in the metric that can lead to misleading interpretations, especially when dealing with sparse data or high-dimensional spaces. The author suggests that alternatives like Euclidean distance or more context-aware techniques should be considered to better capture the nuances in data comparisons, ultimately aiming for more accurate and meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're using cosine similarity when retrieving for a RAG application, a good approach is to then use a "semantic re-ranker" or "L2 re-ranking model" to re-rank the results to better match the user query.There's an example in the pgvector-python that uses a cross-encoder model for re-ranking: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/exam...You can even use a language model for re-ranking, though it may not be as good as a model trained specifically for re-ranking purposes.In our Azure RAG approaches, we use the AI Search semantic ranker, which uses the same model that Bing uses for re-ranking search results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In the US, word2vec might tell you espresso and cappuccino are practically identical. It is not a claim you would make in Italy.True, and quite funny. This is an excellent, well-written and very informative article, but this part is wrongly worded:&gt; Let's have a task that looks simple, a simple quest from our everyday life: "What did I do with my keys?" [and compare it to other notes using cosine similarity]: "Where did I put my wallet" [=&gt; 0.6], "I left them in my pocket" [=&gt; 0.5]&gt; The best approach is to directly use LLM query to compare two entries, [along the lines of]: "Is {sentence_a} similar to {sentence_b}?"(bits in brackets paraphrased for quoting convenience)This will result in the same, or "worse" result, as any LLM will respond that "Where did I put my wallet" is very similar to "What did I do with my keys?", while "I left them in my pocket" is completely dissimilar.I'm actually not sure what the author was trying to get at here? You could ask an LLM 'is that sentence a plausible answer to the question' and then it would work; but if you ask for pure 'likeness', it seems that in many cases, LLMs' responses will be close to cosine similarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So word vectors solve the problem that two words may never appear in the same context, yet can be strongly correlated. "Python" may never be found close to "Ruby", yet "scripting" is likely to be found in both their contexts so the embedding algorithm will ensure that they are close in some vector space. Except it rarely works well because of the curse of dimensionality.Perhaps one could represent word embeddings as vertices, rather than vectors? Suppose you find "Python" and "scripting" in the same context. You draw a weighted edge between them. If you find the same words again you reduce the weight of the edge. Then to compute the similarity between two words, just compute the weighted shortest path between their vertices. You could extend it to pair-wise sentence similarity using Steiner trees. Of course it would be much slower than cosine similarity, but probably also much more useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the generous free tier offered by Cloudflare Pages, highlighting its strategic purpose in attracting developers and fostering a community of users. It explains that this approach not only allows developers to build and deploy projects without initial costs but also encourages them to adopt more advanced features as their needs grow. The piece emphasizes the long-term benefits for Cloudflare, as happy users are likely to convert to paid plans, enhancing customer loyalty and driving revenue growth for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Additionally, there's plenty of "Upgrade to Pro" buttons sprinkled about. It's the freemium model at work.I don't think they care much about few "Pro" upgrades here and there. The real money, and their focus as a company, is in enterprise contracts. Note that, Matthew Prince, the CEO, had outlined a few reasons why they have such a generous free tier on an Stack Exchange answer[1]. I think the biggest reason is this:&gt; Bandwidth Chicken &amp; Egg: in order to get the unit economics around bandwidth to offer competitive pricing at acceptable margins you need to have scale, but in order to get scale from paying users you need competitive pricing. Free customers early on helped us solve this chicken &amp; egg problem. Today we continue to see that benefit in regions where our diversity of customers helps convince regional telecoms to peer with us locally, continuing to drive down our unit costs of bandwidth.Cloudflare had decided long ago that they wanted to work at an incredible scale. I would actually be very interested in understanding how this vision came to be. Hope Matthew writes that book someday.[1]: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/88685.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not really free. One day, you get a call from their sales team saying "you're straining our network". I kid you not. We were on a business plan and still got this. When we met them in person, we were asked to upgrade to a $2000+ per month plan. From a $200/mo plan. That's a 10x increase. I searched their TOS, nowhere it was mentioned about "straining their network". Turns out that's just their scammy tactic to get you to pay. We refused. That really left a bad taste in my mouth.Today, I refuse to recommend any client or startup to them because of this extremely unethical practice. All around, I'm not sure they deserve so much positive press/attention, especially after screwing some of their own employees (one even got super famous live streaming the firing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh boy, where to start..&gt; So why is Cloudflare Pages' bandwidth unlimited?&gt; Why indeed. Strategically, Cloudflare offering unlimited bandwidth for small static sites like mine fits in with its other benevolent servicesThose are not "benevolent". Seeing a substantial amount of name resolutions of the internet is a huge and unique asset that greatly benefits their business.&gt; like 1.1.1.1 (that domain lol)It's an IP address, not a domain. And they paid a lot of money for that "lol", so that people have an easy time remembering it. Just like Google with 8.8.8.8. Not to be benevolent, but to minimize the threshold for you to give them your data.&gt; Second, companies like Cloudflare benefit from a fast, secure internet.It's the exact opposite. The less secure the internet, the more people buy Cloudflare's services. In a perfectly secure intetnet, nobody would need Cloudflare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712433</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The movie, Rebel Ridge, does a decent job showing just how bad this can be in a small town. It's not exactly realistic for how the former Marine depicted chose to try to resolve the situation... It does give room to consider just how corrupt it can all be. Consider if you live in a town with only one bank. 
Clearly the bank and the police have a relationship and in a small town, odds are they all know each other quite well. Say someone withdraws money from the bank. Then the teller sort of rats you out to law enforcement or someone adjacent to law enforcement. They manufacture an excuse to pull you over just as was done in this Nevada story. The movie Rebel Ridge goes into the difficulty in even getting your money back in the first place. At one point they explain a large part of the police departments funding comes from this. Then again, it isn't just small police departments getting kick backs, it's everyone involved to run up the cost for someone who had their money stolen.At some point, civil forfeiture laws will lay the foundation for having any amount of cash being a sort of assumption of criminality. Consider too that smaller banks and even large banks have reserve requirements but not enough to cover all of the deposits. When most money exists in digital form in a database somewhere, over time, the concept of real paper money gets that assumption of wrong doing. Almost like it is the financial equivalent of "you must have something to hide, or else you would be using your credit card".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US legal system (unlike some other countries) is built on the presumption of innocence. Civil forfeiture completely contravenes that principle and is therefore essentially extortion and corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  18 U.S. Code § 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the Lambda architecture, which is a framework for building robust and scalable data processing systems. It outlines the main components of the architecture, including the batch layer, speed layer, and serving layer, emphasizing their roles in handling large volumes of data and providing real-time analytics. The site provides insights into the benefits and challenges of implementing Lambda architecture, as well as practical examples and considerations for developers looking to adopt this approach in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been attracted to this - along with 2D cellular automata - a bit like a moth to a flame for some time. I find the little machine visualisations mesmerising, the heavily parenthesized Greek representation charming (they look like standing orders written in an alien language, looking for all the world like space invaders) and the tiny code sizes magical.But I can't quite wrap my mind around the core concepts and internalize them into a mental model. It's too different from the simple world of imperative C or scripting languages I guess I call home. So I'm left watching das blinkenlights from the outside, as my attention span chokes on the layers of computer science incorporated into typical explanations. *shrug*I'd be very interested if anyone knows of an ELI5-style alternate path I could walk to break each of the concepts down one at a time. (I ask because I think this is (currently) the kind of thing I think ChatGPT would struggle to present as effectively as a human.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. If anyone wants to see an example of an awesome program you can run on the 520 byte version of my lambda calculus virtual machine (Blc) then check out https://github.com/woodrush/lambdalisp If you run the command in that project, it'll download my VM from the blog post, build a 20kb lambda expression you can pipe into it, and BOOM a fully object-oriented LISP REPL will appear in your terminal. It's like magic. For an example expression, try typing (+ 2 3) and hit enter. Then type (let ((a 2) (b 3)) (+ a b)) and hit enter. You need an x86 linux machine to do this right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;nine="λλ [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 0]]]]]]]]]"Looks like Brainfuck in disguise :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679191</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Nobody Cares" by Grant Slatton explores the theme of personal responsibility and self-determination in the face of life's challenges. Slatton emphasizes that while external support is valuable, ultimately, individuals must take charge of their own lives and decisions. He argues against the victim mentality and encourages readers to adopt a proactive mindset, focusing on their goals and actions rather than seeking validation from others. The piece serves as a motivational call to embrace accountability and drive personal change.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its ironic, because this dude doesn't seem to care enough to even the slightest bit of research to understand why any of these problems he highlights are the way they are, and lazily attributes everything to OTHER people not caring. LEDs last longer, are more energy efficient, and also reduce light pollution because they are more directional[1]. Took me 30 seconds to google. There are enormous design standards for designing bike lanes[2]. It is almost certainly the case the design of this intersection is dictated by these standards. But sure, just assume it's because everyone is stupid.[1] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/streetlights-are-...
[2] https://streetsillustrated.seattle.gov/design-standards/bicy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that depresses me is how ugly our cities have become. Buildings that go up are designed with a total lack of aesthetic intention. In Seattle, ostensibly there is a design review committee for multifamily and commercial buildings, but it doesn't appear to have made the city look any better, and their 2025 goals include "streamlining the Design Review process to be quicker and less costly for applicants, and reducing the number of projects that are required to go through Design Review."This is the committee that's supposed to care about this, and they don't. And the architects don't because they're not being paid to make a beautiful façade. And the developers don't because they want to finish construction as quickly and cheaply as possible. And the residents of the city don't care because they're apathetic about living in a beautiful environment.What kills me though is that we travel to landmarks in New York City or Florence or wherever, and gawk at the beautifully-designed old buildings and charming plazas, and seem to lack the recognition that we could live in places just as beautiful if somebody cared.It doesn't really have to cost much more. I used to live in a 20th century building originally built as a schoolhouse. The city architect, who was budget-constrained, still made a point of including decorative brickwork. 120 years later it was by far the most attractive building on the street.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The McDonald's touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.I was working in this space! And I got fired for refusing to work on more upsell features for clients like Coca Cola and such.I don't want to work on adding fucking ADS into checkout.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to ban Red Dye No. 3, a food coloring linked to cancer, which gained attention due to advocacy from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The ban reflects ongoing concerns about the safety of food additives and the growing scrutiny over chemicals in the food supply. The article outlines the potential implications of this decision for food manufacturers and consumers, noting the history of the dye's use and previous regulatory actions surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact - this is how blue raspberry was created as a flavor. Raspberry flavored things were purple, made from a combination of red and blue dye. The red dye (red no 2) was banned. So companies making raspberry flavored stuff just left the red dye out and said "raspberry is blue now" and we all went "shit yeah it is, always has been! why would raspberry be anything other than blue?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the CNN article:&gt; There don’t appear to be any studies establishing links between red dye No. 3 and cancer in humans, and “relevant exposure levels to FD&amp;C Red No. 3 for humans are typically much lower than those that cause the effects shown in male rats,” the FDA said in its constituent update posted Wednesday. “Claims that the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 3 in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.”&gt; But “it doesn’t matter, because the FDA mandate under the Delaney Clause says that if it shows cancer in animals or humans, they’re supposed to keep it from the food supply,” said Dr. Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.Even more confusing - the FDA still doesn't believe there's a cancer link with humans. But they are banning it anyway on a technicality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comparison between American and Canadian Froot Loop cereal is illuminating:https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/uc265y/a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711556</guid></item><item><title>12.

These are just pieces of metal, U-channel, L-channel, or solid bar, to add some structural strength. Cheap and easy, but rarely seen in hobbyist work. Any board with buttons or knobs or connectors unsupported for more than a few inches should have some stiffening. You have to allow space for stiffening bars when designing the board, and you need to place screw holes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672366</guid></item><item><title>13.

Also welcome are recommendations for how to remove any of the unsafe code without introducing significant space or performance regressions, or how to compartmentalize the unsafe code even better."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust is missing an abstraction over non-contiguous chunks of contiguous allocations of data that would make handling ropes seamless and more natural even for smaller sizes.C# has the concept of “Sequences” which is basically a generalization of a deque with associated classes and apis such as ReadOnlySequence and SequenceReader to encourage reduced allocations, reuse of existing buffers/slices even for composition, etcKnowing the rust community, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s already an RFC for something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hadn't heard of rope data structures until I read about the xi editor (also written in Rust) a few years ago, but it looks like that's been discontinued.https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711966</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing backlash in Sweden regarding the heavy reliance on digital education tools in schools, particularly in reading and writing instruction. Educators and parents express concerns that digital platforms hinder traditional literacy skills, as children become increasingly adept at using technology but struggle with fundamental reading and writing. Critics argue that while digital tools can enhance learning experiences, they should not replace traditional methods. The debate highlights the need for a balanced approach in education that incorporates both digital resources and conventional teaching techniques to ensure students develop essential literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Into notes in Obsidian, that I can link to in my study notes.Recently I started buying paper based books again. Man, I missed holding physical books in my hands. And I start to regret having gotten rid of my physical library. There were so many memories I had with most of these books. I remember their covers, and instantly my emotions , thoughts, feelings are triggered. I don’t have these emotions when I think of my digital books.My spouse has books that she was gifted when she was a child. Still in our kids shelf. I cannot give her my digital books.I regret the decision having gone fully digital, which can only be a complement to physical books.Printed books are a physical experience. Something that allows me to attach thoughts, emotions, feelings to it. And they can become part of my life. Like a good friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely agree that just giving kids a laptop/chromebook instead of books is not working.  My own child and her friends just don't have the focus required, and easily get distracted out to email, group chats, everything else going on right next to the text.That said, one thing I appreciate is that she doesn't have to lug around 30lb backpacks like kids did when I was a child.  We had lockers, but realistically they didn't provide adequate time to utilize them, so everyone just carried around all their books for the day.  Most of us hunched forward because of the weight.It seems like something like a dumb ereader would be a good middle ground?  Put all the textbooks into one place, but don't give it the ability to do anything but read?  That or keep the textbooks in the classroom and share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm unclear if this is a real article.It claims to be published in 2025 but it refers to 2022-2025 in the future tense.&gt; [...] Sweden’s putting 104 million euros into bringing books back into classrooms from 2022 to 2025See the comment identifying a legitimate source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716448&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715841</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide for Django developers on how to effectively integrate modern JavaScript into their web applications. It discusses key JavaScript concepts and frameworks, such as ES6 features, asynchronous programming, and popular libraries like React and Vue.js. The guide emphasizes the importance of using JavaScript to enhance user interfaces and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, it covers best practices for setting up a development environment, managing dependencies, and optimizing performance, helping Django developers to leverage the power of modern JavaScript in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent article, and SaaS Pegasus is a great solution for people starting a project.But some of the advice here is dated. The architectural patterns are still valid, but the specifics have changed:* Vite instead of create-react-app (which is unmaintained now) / webpack / babel /  Parcel / etc.* Django-ninja as a lightweight API service.I think these are important to call out because they really simplify the frontend compared to the previous options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having used HTMX and Unpoly with Django, for over 2 years now, I prefer using Unpoly more these days.Unpoly feels just like Django, it is a more of a framework than a thin layer, but that means it comes with a lot of productive features built-in, albeit opinionated.It covers 95% of the use-cases of a typical web app, with its layers and forms concepts. E.g. I love creating "subinteractions" with unpoly, where a complex process can be divided into smaller modal forms for creating the "related" objects of a model, which then updates the main form of the model itself. Unpoly makes these simple, and its documentation caters for exactly these scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've tried several boilerplates like SaaSPegasus and one thing I can't really get around is that I feel like the experience of developing in a docker-compose with two build-and-serve containers (e.g. one with gunicorn auto-reload and the other running something like esbuild for the frontend) is very clunky in VSCode?I feel like I'm doing something crazy, this must be a problem many other people have, but things like language server integration on the JS and Python side separately do not mesh well.If anyone sees this and has a minimal open source boilerplate to recommend I'd love to try it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711387</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for converting ePub files into audiobook formats. It outlines the necessary tools and steps, including using Python scripts to extract text and convert it into speech, which can then be saved as audio files. The process is aimed at helping users who prefer listening to books rather than reading them, providing a practical solution for creating audiobooks from existing ePub content. The article is particularly beneficial for those interested in technology and audio processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, this is very convenient. Probably cool for some non-fiction.On the other, some of my favorite audio books all stood out because the narrator was interpreting the text really well, for example by changing the pacing during chaotic moments. Or those audiobooks with multiple narrators and different voices for each character. Not to mention that sometimes the only cue you get for who's speaking during dialogue is how the voice actor changes their tone. I have mixed feelings about using this and losing some of that quality.I would totally use this over amateur ebooks or public domain audiobooks like the ones on project guttenberg. As cool as it is/was for someone to contribute to free books... as a listener it was always jarring to switch to a new chapter and hear a completely different voice and microphone quality for no reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality is great (amazing even), but I can't listen to AI generated voices for more than 1 minute. 
I don't know why, I just don't like it. 
I immediately skip the video on youtube if the voice is AI generated.Might be because our brains try to 'feel' the speaker, the emotion, the pauses, the invisible smile, etc.No doubt models will improve and will be harder to identify as AI generated, but for now, as with diffusion images, I still notice it and react by just moving on..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone recommend an open source option that would allow training on a custom voice (my own, so I'd be able to record as many snippets as it needed to train on) to allow me to use it for TTS generation without sharing it off my machine?Edit: I'll wait to see if any recommendations get made here, if not I might give this one a go: https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708773</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything else aside, this is an absolutely fantastic development and I really hope the ceasefire holds and all hostages are released.I just fear this will cause western media and politicians to and declare the crisis to be over (after it had began on Oct. 7, of course absolutely out of the blue and without any context...) and go back to pretending everything is back to normal. Never mind that Gaza is still in ruins, the west bank is still being annexed, Israel still has the dual role of "all authority, no obligations" over the Palestinians, while  making it pretty clear they have no vision for them at all, apart from "maybe they just vanish into thin air tomorrow".And never mind that Israel still has a fundamentalist, authoritarian government that is actively at work undermining democratic structures and civil rights even inside the state - that too with no word of objection from its allies.We'll see where all of that goes.I also found Trump's signalling in the whole issue odd. His base and his cabinet is full of the most hard-line pro-israel figures imaginable, but then he goes forward and quotes Jeffrey Sachs and ostensibly pressures Netanyahu into accepting the ceasefire.Is this just his usual "appear unpredictable by all means" spiel or does he have a strategy there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamas was offered a ceasefire under exactly the same terms in May, and refused it. Since then:* Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Hamas political wing, was killed in Tehran* Yahyah Sinwar, the leader of the Al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in Gaza* Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah, was killed in Beirut* Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, was killed a week later* Large swathes of Hezbollah's command and control were wiped out in the pager attack* Bashar al-Assad, Iran's most important military client, fled SyriaThe Al-Qassam Brigades are shattered. Mohammad Sinwar, its current leader, is reported by ISW not to have communications with most of its new recruits, who are scavenging improvised weapons from unexploded ordinance. Iran's "Axis of Resistance" lies in tatters, their foreign/military strategy, of which Hamas was a key component, now seems totally repudiated. Hamas has lost most of its remaining infrastructure, supply chains, and support.They should have taken the deal when it was first offered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I suppose it's just back to the status quo? What has really changed that will make a difference in 2-3 years from now? Israel has sowed a whole fresh generation of "I will sacrifice everything to wipe Israel" Palestinian youth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716440</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced that it will be offering free AI features in Google Workspace, aimed at enhancing productivity for users. This includes features like automated writing suggestions, smart scheduling, and improved collaboration tools. The initiative is designed to make Workspace more accessible and competitive, enabling users to leverage AI capabilities without incurring additional costs. As part of its commitment to innovation, Google is focusing on integrating these advanced functionalities seamlessly within its existing suite of productivity tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Workspace AI includes things like email summaries in Gmail, generated designs for spreadsheets and videos, an automated note-taker for meetings, the powerful NotebookLM research assistant, and writing tools across apps.Maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon stuck in my ways, but I haven't found much compelling value in these use cases in my day-to-day work. For summaries and note-taking specifically, I feel they're solving the wrong problem: it's not that I have all this information that I really want to go through, but it's that I have too much information and it's become all noise.The real solution to too much email is fewer and higher-priority emails. The real solution to too many meetings is fewer and more-focused meetings. These tools paper over the root cause of the problem, which is that people/organizations cannot (or are unwilling to) be clear about communication priorities and say "maybe this email/meeting isn't a good use of time after all."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw a Google AI advert that said:"Hey Gemini, write an apology email for my friend. I can't make their wedding."That's not a future I want to live in, and I love making machines work for me.Thats not what I want my children to think is OK.A friend of mine is a teacher and kids are already delegating their learning to ChatGPT and their learning isn't sticking.What happens when social skills are delegated too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pay for 3 Workspace orgs, and I have Gemini disabled (or still not enabled) on all 3 of them. I'm angry that I'll have to pay more for features I don't use. Gemini should be an add-on cost, not included in the base costIf they're raising the price of personal GMail, I don't have a problem. But Workspace with hundreds of users, now that's a problem, because it actually hurts my wallet significantly. When this increase comes, I'll have to move elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710978</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Transformer Squared, an innovative model in the field of machine learning that enhances the capabilities of traditional transformer architectures. It introduces a new technique that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of neural networks in natural language processing by leveraging adaptive attention mechanisms and incorporating a two-dimensional structure for data representation. The model aims to address common challenges in processing large datasets while maintaining high performance, ultimately offering promising solutions for various applications in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One weakness of this method is the storage of decomposed UV from W. My linear algebra is rusty, but it seems required if you want to scale in that U projected subspace, hence double your weight memory footprint (that has been said, U / V should be easier to quantize from information theory perspective). I also think MoE is more principled if you want to have experts activations. But I understand that Sakana's research focus mostly is about adapting existing pretrained models, not to do it from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like MoE and maybe a bit of chain-of-thought. Curious what someone with more domain expertise thinks about thisIf they can test against Llama 70B and Mistral 7B, they ought to compare against Mistral 8x7b imho&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great research here. Contextual real-time weight modification is definitely one of the breakthroughs required for AGI. Why create a LoRA when you can generate one on the fly suited to the task at hand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705935</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you care fairness, I have 1 extra suggestion that you might be interested in.It was proven by several data-science research that when users have to votes (or give ratings) and if they are able to see the previous result, then the first few votes have an extremely important effect.For instance here is one stury, very well written article by a famous teacher Robert West, "of sheep and beer" https://dlab.epfl.ch/2017-08-30-of-sheep-and-beer/ which describes this effect on beer-rating sites.One way to overcome this effect is to hide the votes until enough votes were collected (eg more than 50). Another way is to hide votes until you have voted yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking cool! I have two questions though:&gt;10 launches per day, max.What if your launch queue will be filling at a much faster rate aka backpressure issue? E.g what if this went viral and you get 1000 new projects per day, any new launch is scheduled after three months then?&gt;2 votes per user, per day.Any idea how to prevent someone from creating 10 fake accounts and making it 20 votes per day? I'm sure any entrepreneur will see this opportunity right away if a little cheating means more exposure.Looks like a good alternative to product hunt, the UI is looking fresh and I like it, however I'm genuinely interested about your thoughts on the problems this model can have at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Ryan Hoover would take back the integrity of Product Hunt. It's such an amazing product with such currently painful execution, assumingly in the name of site traffic traded for ad dollars.I truly think that the conversion rate for advertisers on PH would go UP if the quality of the site (moderated posts, comments, bot traffic) did the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712666</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;Pyper is a Python package designed to facilitate communication between Python and R. It allows users to run R scripts from Python, retrieve R objects into Python, and provides a simple interface for data exchange. This integration is particularly useful for leveraging R's statistical capabilities and extensive libraries alongside Python's versatility. The package is easy to install and works across different operating systems, making it accessible for data scientists and analysts who wish to combine the strengths of both programming languages in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work! There is a gap when it comes to writing single-machine, concurrent CPU-bound python code. Ray is too big, pykka is threads only, builtins are poorly abstracted. The syntax is also very nice!But I'm not sure I can use this even though I have a specific use-case that feels like it would work well (high-performance pure Python downloading from cloud object storage). The examples are a bit too simple and I don't understand how I can do more complicated things.I chunk up my work, run it in parallel and then I need to do a fan-in step to reduce my chunks - how do you do that in Pyper?Can the processes have state? Pure functions are nice, but if I'm reaching for multiprocess, I need performance and if I need performance, I'll often want a cache of some sort (I don't want to pickle and re-instantiate a cloud client every time I download some bytes for instance).How do exceptions work? Observability? Logs/prints?Then there's stuff that is probably asking too much from this project, but I get it if I write my own python pipeline so it matters to me - rate limiting WIP, cancellation, progress bars.But if some of these problems are/were solved and it offers an easy way to use multiprocessing in python, I would probably use it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You really should dive more into the `multiprocess` support option and highlight how this gets around issues with the GIL. This feels like a major value add, and "does this help with CPU-bound work" being "yes" is a big deal!I don't really need pipelining that much, but pipelining along with a certain level of durability and easy multiprocessing support? Now we're talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowkey I hate the "\" line continuation in Python to force PEP-8 compliance in a way... Is there any Pythonistas who would write the examples in there differently to achieve a similar level of readability?&gt;    pipeline = task(get_data, branch=True) \&gt;        | task(step1, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step2, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step3, workers=20, multiprocess=True)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673273</guid></item><item><title>22.

I'm guessing this is the intended meaning of the term in the name. When most decently well informed, native speakers of English hear "simplex," though, they are likely to hear "herpes simplex" and so are likely to wonder, as I did, whether, or why, the program is named after a sexually transmitted disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great demo, straight to the point. It might be nice to have some kind of feedback mechanism if it can't find the element on the page, or if it's partially cut off. For example, I changed the GitHub profile to my own (https://github.com/spro) in the example and it doesn't scroll down far enough for the whole image. I imagine in general it would be nice to scroll to an element ID (or even element description using the vision models) instead of a hardcoded value.Side-note: The comment for the frequency graph is wrong, it mentions stars instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704160</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a really smart idea to try to leverage the inherent scalability of semiconductor photonics. I think the use of a linear optical resonator to amplify a weak optical nonlinearity is quite genius, and something the relatively small nonlinear photonics community has been trying to do forever. That they showed this kind of 'all-optical-ish' nonlinearity on a relatively mature process in a foundry is nothing to scoff at, and likely one of the biggest results in semiconductor photonics in a while. At the single device level I think it makes so much sense, but what concerns me in general is how well this scales from a few perspectives:1. resonators and device-to-device variance: in general it's pretty hard to get these resonant effects to line up with each other from a production POV, especially with large arrays. Silicon photonics has come far, but I don't think it has approached the level of uniformity as electronics. They have demonstrated some level of electro-optic tunability, which is the traditional solution, but they still need to leverage that for their nonlinear effects too.2. area and space: the 'minimum' trace size of these planar photonics circuits is still quite large (~200 nm minimum feature size typically for these waveguides). This is essentially due to a minimum size needed to confine light within a waveguide which depends generally on the waveguide's refractive index and target wavelength. These are currently all integrated on a planar manner, so each channel becomes quite large, especially if now you also need a relatively large ring resonator, which in this case is at least ~100 micrometers or so in diameter3. the combination of 1 and 2: high device-to-device variation, along with a large planar footprint means that these things are quite expensive and difficult to manufacture, without some kind of miniaturization benefit that you would typically get with electronics (at least not yet). This effect appears to be more than the sum of 1 + 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting to see how work in this space is progressing.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Cerebras Systems has implemented a remarkable 100x defect tolerance in their AI chips to address manufacturing yield issues. It highlights the innovative design and architectural choices made to minimize the impact of defects in the silicon, enabling the production of high-performance chips despite potential flaws. This capability significantly enhances reliability and performance, allowing for the delivery of more powerful computing solutions in AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is an important step, but it skips over that 'fault tolerant routing architecture' means you're spending die space on routes vs transistors. This is exactly analogous to using bits in your storage for error correcting vs storing data.That said, I think they do a great job of exploiting this technique to create a "larger"[1] chip. And like storage it benefits from every core is the same and you don't need to get to every core directly (pin limiting).In the early 2000's I was looking at a wafer scale startup that had the same idea but they were applying it to an FPGA architecture rather than a set of tensor units for LLMs. Nearly the exact same pitch, "we don't have to have all of our GLUs[2] work because the built in routing only uses the ones that are qualified." Xilinx was still aggressively suing people who put SERDES ports on FPGAs so they were pin limited overall but the idea is sound.While I continue to believe that many people are going to collectively lose trillions of dollars ultimately pursuing "AI" at this stage. I appreciate the the amount of money people are willing to put at risk here allow for folks to try these "out of the box" kinds of ideas.[1] It is physically more cores on a single die but the overall system is likely smaller, given the integration here.[2] "Generic Logic Unit" which was kind of an extended LUT with some block RAM and register support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they massively reduce the area lost to defects per wafer, from 361 to 2.2 square mm. But from the figures in this blog, this is massively outweighed by the fact that they only get 46222 sq mm useable area out of the wafer, as opposed to 56247 that the H100 gets - because they are using a single square die instead of filling the circular wafer with smaller square dies, they lose 10,025 sq mm!Not sure how that's a win.Unless the rest of the wafer is useable for some other customer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat. What about power density?An H100 has a TDP of 700 watts (for the SXM5 version). With a die size of 814 mm^2 that's 0.86 W/mm^2. If the cerebras chip has the same power density, that means a cerebras TDP of 37.8 kW.That's a lot. Let's say you cover the whole die area of the chip with water 1 cm deep. How long would it take to boil the water starting from room temperature (20 degrees C)?amount of water = (die area of 46225 mm^2) * (1 cm deep) * (density of water) = 462 gramsenergy needed = (specific heat of water) * (80 kelvin difference) * (462 grams) = 154 kJtime = 154 kJ / 39.8 kW = 3.9 secondsThis thing will boil (!) a centimeter of water in 4 seconds. A typical consumer water cooler radiator would reduce the temperature of the coolant water by only 10-15 C relative to ambient, and wouldn't like it (I presume) if you pass in boiling water. To use water cooling you'd need some extreme flow rate and a big rack of radiators, right? I don't really know. I'm not even sure if that would work. How do you cool a chip at this power density?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717165</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific speed sign that warns drivers of a potentially dangerous road situation, particularly in areas where the speed limit changes unexpectedly. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to speed limits and remaining vigilant while driving, especially in regions where accidents are common due to sudden changes in speed regulations. The piece uses graphic examples and expert insights to highlight the correlation between speed and traffic safety, ultimately urging readers to take speed signs seriously to avoid serious accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title and some of the comments assume it would be something like if you take 15 extra minutes you would just die. When in reality it would just be an increase in cancer risk. If it were THAT contaminated they'd use the AREA CLOSED the article mentions anyways.To be fatal within days you need about 10,000 mSv of exposure. Even with heavy fallout, exposure would probably be around 10 mSv per hour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly enough, the Fukushima exclusion zone has roads that pretty much fit the bill. They're the pink lines on this map (PDF), with the exclusion zone in gray:https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/pd...You are permitted to drive through but not stop or get out of your car. I presume ordinary speed limits apply though, so no exciting post-apocalyptic signage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself.THEY STILL DO!!!!This is what drives me nuts about our politics: so many people seem to think we can flirt with the sort of nationalism (1) that led us into WWI and WWII. But, friends, that road leads to your death in every direction. Mutually Assured Destruction is still a thing. Nuclear peace only works as long as all parties persistently work toward de-escalation, which can be measured by adherence to consensus and norms. Nationalism is antithetical to that posture. The iconoclast leaders of national populism are rooted in rulebreaking. They also tend to embrace strong foreign policy talk as a short term bolster to domestic support, again, antithetical to de-escalation.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704491</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new approach for developing a quantum geometric phase in a non-adiabatic context, extending the understanding of geometric phases beyond traditional adiabatic frameworks. It highlights the significance of the quantum geometric phase in various applications, including quantum computing and quantum information science. The research employs theoretical models to demonstrate the conditions under which non-adiabatic geometric phases can be effectively generated and manipulated, ultimately contributing to the foundational knowledge of quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20241223001630/https://iopscienc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a degree in theoretical physics, and also did research on general relativity.The result is cool, but it's not directly applicable to the traditional (sci-fi) scenario "I travel to the past and meet myself / my parents / my ancestors"The reason is simple: the authors suppose a CLOSED timelike curve, i.e. something like a circle, where you travel back in time and BECOME your younger self - which by the way only exists because you traveled back in time in the first place.A slightly different scenario would be much more interesting, but my guess is that it's much harder to analyze:a NEARLY closed timelike curve, which arrives from the past, coils around itself one or more times - like a coil, indeed - allowing causal interaction between the different spires (i.e. one can interact with its future self/selves and with its past self/selves), and finally the last spire leaves toward the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "In the introduction, we stated that, since a CTC is a compact set, there is an event x0 where the entropy of the spaceship is minimal. In the proximity of such event, our macroscopic notion of causation breaks down. This is evident in figures 2 and 3, where the existence of the low-entropy state at proper time 
T does not have any macroscopic cause in its near past or future. It just 'fluctuates into existence'. Indeed, any form of order that the event x0 carries (including objects and people) has no logical cause that can be expressed in purely macroscopic terms. For example, if there is a book, nobody wrote it. If a person has a memory, this memory is illusory, and its content is meaningless (by human standards). This is because our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy [1], and there is no event with lower entropy than x0."I don't believe that "our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy."  Entropy's relation to the arrow of time is complex but it's enough for entropy to be non-static, and for things to durably exist in the world, for there to be a notion of movement in time.  If something was written at time T, entropy fluctuated into a minimum at T+100, and entropy increased again at T+200, at all points the original writing event would be traceable back to T.Time appears to stop and things become causally disconnected from each other when entropy reaches minima or maxima and stays there.  Even so, local fluctuations can lead to the emergence of an arrow of time -- e.g. if a glucose molecule coalesces out of the void, you can measure time by it, as it's not perfectly stable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677158</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been maintaining my personal website as plain HTML for five years now. I must say, I quite like this method. There's no substitute for practice when it comes to maintaining your skills at editing HTML and CSS.Yes, you must copy and paste content and not having layout page is annoying at times. But the overhead of just doing it yourself is surprisingly small in terms of the time commitment.Typically, I'll draft a post in MS Word then open the git repo for my site, hosted on github pages, duplicate and rename the template.html page that includes the CSS, footer, and header for my site and then copy my content into it. When I'm happy with everything, I'll make my commit and then a minute later it's live at my custom domain. Seeing that it takes only 11KBs and 26ms to load my landing page strangely delightful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot you can do with just plain html these days if you just need a clean site. Here's an example from my recipe site (https://xilic.com/recipia/sauces/pesto_traditional.html), mostly for my personal use or sharing with friends, with only html/css. It has expandable boxes, a menu system, etc. A simple script converts a directory structure of .csv files to these recipe cards with a template, and this way you can edit the sources in a spreadsheet and then the publish script just takes whatever is new and re-does the whole lot of html as necessary. Just like we used to do with Apache Forest!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website of one of the most influential IT person, who won the court battle against U.S. Government, allowing for widespread cryptography, professor Daniel J. Bernstein, is and always has been plain HTML mostly with no CSS.https://cr.yp.to/It's served using his own HTTP server - publicfile, and the DNS domain is served using his own DNS server - djbdns. E-mail is handled using his own SMTP server - qmail. He invented the Maildir e-mail format, de facto standard in all e-mail products. All e-mail mailing lists for his products are handled by his own mailing list server - ezmlm. All of this is managed using his replacements to /etc/rc or /etc/init.d or systemd - daemontools.He invented ChaCha and Salsa stream ciphers, now in widespread use, as well as elliptic curves, especially the famous Curve25519, and the Poly1305 MAC.He also invented TCP SYN cookies.Pretty impressive, no?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705077</guid></item><item><title>28. dnSpyEx: .NET debugger and assembly editor</title><link>https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy</link><description>

Used to bypass a license in one .NET app where we really had bought a lifetime license but it still expired (we were in a hurry and didn't receive the new one in time).The authors homepage has a link to crash iPhone. I clicked it with Chrome on Windows and it crashed :D (https://elektrokill.github.io/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DnSpy was great. The author (d4d) did many great things for the world of .net reversing and binary analysis, including dnspy and dnlib. One day, i don't know why, they archived most of their repositories.I'm glad electrokill stepped up and maintains dnspyex now. This also shows how resilient open source can be - as long as someone wants to work on the project, it can go on forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this tool, used it mod a Unity game and learn all the internals to see how to integrate my mod with the base game. Was an invaluable resource. It also taught me a lot about how they made that game (Lethal Company) and how it was truly made to ship/get the idea out the door and not for perfection/maintainable code.~~IIRC the maintainer was like 15 years old?~~ Edit: My mistake, the maintainer is 18, https://github.com/ElektroKill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716072</guid></item><item><title>29.

I kind of miss that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AOL Desktop is still a thing in 2025 and was updated as recently as a few days ago.Michael MJD just did a video on it. Still contains Elwood's classic soundbites, along with some snazzy images of current pop stars like Avril Lavigne.https://youtu.be/jUsym8iAWHY?si=vU5I15-qWKaEZPwC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how many recordings he did. I hope that more people come out of the woodwork and share the recordings they bought from him, like in this case, especially if there are some slightly silly ones (like "Use the source, Luke!").Aside: I was so worried it was going to be an AI voice generator based on his voice. I sadly think it's inevitable but I can hope he didn't make enough recordings to be able to reliably synthesize his voice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695005</guid></item><item><title>30.

It was very actively curated in the beginning but it quickly became hard to find the good stuff and after a couple years of emphasis on promoting royalty-free music for film it kind of drifted away from its original mantra of "It's not just free music; it's good music".Honestly kind of bummed with where the project landed, presumably sold for peanuts to a for-profit so they can use it for lead gen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run a soundscape/white noise website (https://ambiph.one) and used FMA to find some really great music for the radio stations, though I did have to do a lot of virtual crate-digging to find it - I found the discovery features very limited.I had a bit more luck on Bandcamp, which lets artists use Creative Commons licences but strangely doesn't surface that at all as a search filter. I had to resort to searching for "some rights reserved" via Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Abandcamp.com+lofi+%2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was the lead software engineer on this project when it was conceived, designed, and built. The people at WFMU were so great to work with and absolutely dedicated to getting it right.I don't know much about its current incantation, but I appreciate that the owning company kept the original "About" page with my name and the team I worked with to make it happen.It's one of the projects I'm most proud of. Also, sadly (in a personal legacy sense), one of the few projects I've worked on in the past quarter century that is still standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674003</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a humorous marriage proposal that is entirely composed of office jargon and corporate speak. Through a series of cliché business terms and phrases, the proposer conveys their love and commitment in a playful and satirical manner, showcasing the absurdity of using such language in a deeply personal moment. The blend of romantic sentiment and professional vocabulary creates a comedic contrast, making the proposal both entertaining and relatable to anyone familiar with corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I could be alone, but one of my biggest office-speak pet peeves is using verbs as nouns.Like “ask” (I hear this one all the time), “(value) add”, and “solve” (used in this article - I cringed).I see this a lot on HN too, so again, many others here will obviously not agree. But I’ll intentionally use “request” or “question” over “ask” just in protest.I know the English language has been using some verbs as nouns for millennia, but there are particular ones (like the ones above) that I mostly hear at the office (or outside the office, but spoken by “office folk”), and it’s definitely an annoy.EDIT: Turns out I'm not alone. Thanks for the validate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a long-time friend who, after years in fintech, now sometimes speaks this way unironically in non-work situations.  I mean, I still think he's a good guy overall but when he recommends the DND party splits up to maximize ROI on a spell rather than just say "let's split up", it does make me cringe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I proposed to my wife, I met her after a couple of years and didn't know at the time if she was seeing someone. 
I nudged the conversation towards that topic and once I found out that she isn't, I literally proposed to her in office jargon. 
I said, "So if the vacancy is still available, can I apply?". She said yes, and we got married eventually but she still isn't too happy about that proposal line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42714775</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses generalized LR parsing, an advanced technique used in computer science for analyzing the syntax of programming languages. It explains the underlying principles of LR parsing, detailing how it can efficiently process a wide range of grammars. The author highlights the benefits of generalized LR parsing over traditional methods, such as its ability to handle ambiguities and complex language constructs. Additionally, the article provides insights into the implementation of this parsing technique, including practical examples and theoretical foundations, making it a valuable resource for developers and researchers interested in compiler design and syntax analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this yesterday, asking it to create a simple daily reminder task, which it happily did. Then when the time came and went I simply got a chat that the task failed, with no explanation of why or how it failed. When I asked it why, it hallucinated that I had too many tasks. (I only had the one) So, now I don't know why it failed or how to fix it.  Which leads to two related observations:1) I find it interesting that the LLM rarely seems trained to understand it's own features, or about your account, or how the LLM works. Seems strange that it has no idea about it's own support.2) Which leads me to the Open AI support docs[0]. It seems pretty telling to me that they use old-school search and not an LLM for its own help docs, right?[0] https://help.openai.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New killer feature: cronCan’t imagine why everyone doesn’t pay $200/mo for even more features. Eventually I bet they can clean out /tmp!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm trying to figure out how this would be useful with the existing feature set.It seems like it would be good for summarizing daily updates against a search query. but all it would do is display them. I would probably want to connect it with some tools at minimum for it to be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716356</guid></item><item><title>35.

It has a powerful macro language, in which, among other architectures and formats, it implements x86 and ELF/PE/macho and is able to assemble itself.I like to use it for scripting for turning binary formats to text and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool. On the topic of assembly, does anyone know of a language that is higher level than assembly, but retains the property that the output doesn't depend on the compiler or its flags?I want it for low level CPU benchmarks and tests. Using C or assembly for those both suck.I don't really know exactly how this would look (is the register allocator part of the spec?) but has anyone tried something like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo website at https://hlorenzi.github.io/customasm/web/ makes this even more accessible.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the approval of the Natrium advanced nuclear power plant in Wyoming, which has received a crucial permit from state regulators. This facility, developed by TerraPower and backed by billionaire Bill Gates, aims to demonstrate the potential of advanced nuclear technology as a clean energy source. The project is set to produce electricity using a sodium-cooled reactor and is part of broader efforts to reduce carbon emissions and diversify energy sources in the region. The construction of the plant is expected to create jobs and stimulate local economic growth while also addressing energy reliability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

I have bought a lot of games from GOG and have been very happy.  As an exclusively Linux user, I also appreciate how well GOG works with Lutris et al and that they aren't making life harder for those devs.  I love the offline installers and I deeply appreciate their availability.I'm not a big gamer but after watching the industry and Linux/open source in general for many, many years, I'm more convinced than ever that it's the gaming community who will save general purpose computing (that's also a nod to Valve for everything they've done for Linux as well, which has been major).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I liked GOG, but they ignore Linux users, while Steam's Linux support is the best thing that's happened to Linux gaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now if only GOG could fix their Mac client so that you can actually quit it.Maybe someone at GOG will actually read this and let a project manager to let a programmer know to fix this.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their impact on healthcare costs, highlighting the practices of major companies like UnitedHealth, CVS Caremark, and Cigna. It emphasizes concerns about the opacity of PBM pricing structures, high drug prices, and the potential for a monopoly in the PBM market, which could hinder competition and drive up costs for consumers. The FTC aims to address these issues in an effort to improve transparency and reduce prescription drug prices.&lt;/p&gt;

From the report:&gt; "Higher markups can also result in larger internal transfer payments from health plans to affiliated pharmacies, which may allow vertically integrated PBM-pharmacy-insurer entities to retain revenue and profits while formally satisfying the insurers' medical loss ratio ("MLR" ) requirements, but without providing the clinical care and quality improvements that the MLR rule seeks to promote. In
addition, higher markups can result in significant patient cost sharing requirements because
reimbursement rates are often correlated with point-of-sale prices, which can influence how
much patients are required to pay."In other words.  Health insurance firms have capped profits in the US.  But in this case one conglomerate can own both an insurer and a PBM, so it can just overcharge consumers for insurance and then launder its profits through the PBM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/cg4weI do not like UnitedHealth, I do not like our existing crop of health insurance executives, and I might even be viscerally glad at some level that the UnitedHealth CEO was killed in a world where justice clearly takes a back seat to greed, but I wish the headline didn't say "overcharged", because there's no established amount of markup that is the correct amount of markup other than what people end up paying. Is that shitty? Yes. Does it violate a social contract? I think so. But tell me how much the right amount to charge is first. Is that cost? Cost+percentage? They've chosen their percentage. What's the correct one instead?The article body presents the story in a more meaningful way, "UnitedHealth Group is charging patients a markup for key life-saving drugs that could easily exceed their cost by a factor of ten or more".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716428</guid></item><item><title>40.

Let's see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using DynamoDB in 2025 is such a weird proposition.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the year 2007, my working assumption is that if data is not on ZFS on physically redundant media that the data has not been successfully saved. And, any machines that don't have ZFS (some RedHat based boxes) should be configured only through Ansible and configured with the intention that all data (including syslogs) is either forwarded somewhere that does have ZFS or is accessed via NFS (backed by ZFS).Or Ceph Bluestore, which does checksums on physically redundant media. We do N+3 replication because we're lazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know TheFineArticle is in Linux land but for Windows people with this issue you might look at Sysinternals Disk2vhd.[0]It can be run from the online OS itself and it can store the resulting vhd on the same disk it is imaging (with space and disk performance constraints).I find it handy for turning my freshly superceded gaming machine into a VM on my new machine for easy access to files, before doing whatever with my old hardware.[0] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/dis...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, while these block level methods do have a use case, parallel rsync and other file level tools are far safer and often faster with less additional load on the disk.Duplicating the OS/FS behavior hits the decidable problem and you just hope for the best with block level, often you won't notice corruption either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673171</guid></item><item><title>42.

When a bug escapes, it's both the author _and_ reviewer at fault.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I also pushed for breaking large changes into smaller commits, because it is impossible to do a thorough review otherwise.I've found this to be key for both giving and receiving feedback.

And Github's https://github.com/dependabot/ will do that same thing automatically, just based on the existence of the lockfile in your repo (and will also open PRs to bump deps for you).And as mentioned elsewhere: Cargo's dependency resolver supports providing multiple versions of a dep in different dependency subgraphs, which all but eliminates the "dependency hell" that folks expect from ecosystems like Python or the JVM. Two copies of a dep at different versions? Totally fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ With a team of three experienced developers, we have implemented ScopeDB from scratch”“ with 100 direct dependencies and 647 dependencies in total”Next up: watch me build numpy from scratch with only 150 dependencies, one of which numpy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't that something that should be posted April 1? I'm really not sure if the author is proud about the fact that his project has so many dependencies. Is that something modern coders aim for these days?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the controversial use of xenon gas by climbers attempting to summit Everest, highlighting that this substance, which enhances physical performance and is banned in sports, is being utilized by some in the mountaineering community. It profiles various climbers who have reportedly benefited from xenon gas, examining the ethical implications of its use in a sport that already faces challenges with cheating and fair play. The piece raises questions about regulation and safety in extreme sports, particularly in high-stakes environments like Everest, and reflects on the broader impact of performance-enhancing substances in athletic endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhaling Xenon gas is known to be a psychoactive experience, which I only learned about on the show Hamilton’s Pharmacopoeia. He claims the atomic structure of Xenon, by pure chance, fits nicely into one of the psychoactive receptors in the brain.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14099126/?ref_=ttep_ep_3https://boingboing.net/2021/11/25/hamilton-morris-experience...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a theory that the mechanism of action of xenon and perhaps other anesthetics is on the microtubules rather than the receptors, having implications for the neural correlates of consciousness itselfhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09992-7https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXElfzVgg6Mhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S15710...https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07936&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't Xenon infamous for being ridiculously expensive? It's the best general anesthetic by a mile since it's a noble gas, but we don't use it because the cost would be absurd. While the amounts used here must be small, and you're going to be stacked if this is how you're approaching Everest, it must still cost a small fortune — and turns out it does:&gt; One session of xenon gas costs $5,000 per person for a 30-minute session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705180</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "Keon" is a project focused on enhancing the functionality of a programming library designed for algorithm and data structure learning. It provides a collection of implementations and examples in Python, covering various concepts such as searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, and data structures like linked lists and trees. The repository encourages contributions from the community to improve and expand the library, making it a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to deepen their understanding of algorithms and data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

I've written back ends for all three serialization formats used by Second Life.[1] 
(There's a binary form, an XML form, and something called "notation".)
But other than for compatibility with existing code, there's no reason to use them.[1] https://github.com/John-Nagle/serde-llsd&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; human-readable&gt; sytacticly similar to RustChoose one.I kid, I kid, but Rust is not the easiest-reading language out there. It has the same problem as C++, with a syntax that's not terribly straightforward to begin with, but then it's just liberally sprinkled with nearly every bit of punctuation that can by typed with the US QWERTY layout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like there’s three different ways that JSON objects are represented in KEON.It might be more concise, e.g., in the Newtype case, but the sacrifice seems to be quite a bit more cognitive complexity, which I would personally value over conciseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667080</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses static embeddings in the context of natural language processing (NLP), explaining their foundational role in transforming words into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand. It covers various types of static embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, detailing how these embeddings capture semantic meanings and relationships between words. The piece also highlights the limitations of static embeddings compared to contextual embeddings, emphasizing their lack of adaptability to different contexts. Additionally, the blog provides insights into practical applications and comparisons, guiding readers on the usage and understanding of static embeddings in NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the themes and nuances of the song "Talk Dirty to Me" by the band Poison, highlighting its blend of pop and rock elements. It analyzes the lyrics, which focus on themes of desire and physical attraction, and emphasizes the catchy, upbeat nature of the music that captures the essence of the glam metal genre popularized in the late '80s. The piece reflects on the cultural impact of the song and its place in the band's discography, illustrating how it resonates with audiences through its playful and bold expressions of flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;With ~2/3 (and growing) of Earth’s land area being arid, you’d expect there to be a lot more interest in reverse-desertification. It’s pretty well established by now that it’s almost entirely a labor allocation issue given that there’s success stories all over the world [1] (including in the US [2]) to just create earthworks that slow and divert water. Water seems to be the biggest single issue and so many deserts actually get enough of it during flash floods. With how much Elon is interested in terraforming Mars why not just start here?[1] https://youtu.be/UAmai36XJDk?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...
[2] https://youtu.be/3JyEHdJS94s?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amending with biochar is a very good way to jump start the soil life, but regenerative agriculture should go much further than that. There's a bunch of techniques developed in the last few decades, notably permaculture and syntropic agroforestry, as well as techniques for preventing erosion in difficult topography such as keyline planting and scales.But for the soil to be really alive, lots of plants must be planted, in a polyculture context. It's the photosynthesis that feeds the soil's fauna, which then support the plants,  increase fertility and carbon content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I actually do some of this but I'm planning on doing a bit more that I'd like to get their feedback on. For background, I live in the PNW among the trees. My soil is part of a long dead riverbed and thus is mainly silt and sand. I have chickens, a worm bin, and a medium sized compost pile. The trees have the same erosive properties that trees in the Boreal forest have. Douglas firs have shallow roots but are towering trees, the soil just doesn't do them any favors.I'm building a chicken coop that's designed to take pine shavings and be completely emptied once a month with relative ease. The idea is to take the chicken poop and pine shavings and add them to the compost pile. I'll further introduce new worms from my separate vermiculture bin and add them to the compost. This should speed up the break down, but the pile will primarily rely on the Berkeley method to accomplish faster cycles. Each month I should start getting pounds of fresh compost that I can move around my yard.Secondarily to my chicken and worm hobby I love to smoke meat and cheese. I use all of the ash from the pellets to amend the soil as well. I pile it up in a box and spread it around when it gets full. I then till the soil, working it in over time. The natural acidity of the soil from the fir needles has slowly started regressing, but that's the most progress I've gotten thus far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710622</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision of the Keygen team to eliminate phone calls as a means of customer support. They argue that calls can be unproductive and often lead to misunderstandings, advocating instead for written communication methods like email and chat. This approach not only allows for clearer documentation and quicker responses but also enables the support team to manage inquiries more effectively. The article emphasizes that this change is aimed at enhancing both customer satisfaction and the team's efficiency in addressing issues efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a CTO who makes purchasing decisions.  There are numerous products I likely would have purchased, but I either find a substitute or just go without because I won't play the stupid "let's get on a call" game.If your website doesn't give me enough information to:1.  Know enough about your product to know that it will (generally speaking) meet my needs/requirements.2.  Know that the pricing is within the ballpark of reasonable given what your product does.Then I will move on (unless I'm really desparate, which I assure you is rarely the case).  I've rolled-my-own solution more than once as well when there were no other good competitors.That's not to say that calls never work or don't have a place, because they definitely do.  The key to using the call successfully (with me at least) is to use the call to get into true details about my needs, after I know that you're at least in the ballpark.  Additionally, the call should be done efficiently.  We don't need a 15 minute introduction and overview about you.  We don't need a bunch of small talk about weather or sports.  2 minutes of that is ok, or when waiting for additional people to join the call, but beyond that I have things to do.I know what my needs are.  I understand you need some context on my company and needs in order to push useful information forward, and I also understand that many potential customers will not take the lead in asking questions and providing that context, but the sooner you take the temperature and adjust, the better.  Also, you can get pretty far as a salesperson if you just spend 5 minutes looking at our website before the call!  Then you don't have to ask basic questions about what we do.  If you're willing to invest in the time to get on a call, then it's worth a few minutes of time before-hand to look at our website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only works if your sales strategy is all about inbound sales, i.e. content marketing (like this article)/ads.But if you're an enterprise b2b company and want to grow quickly rather than taking 8 years to go beyond 1 solopreneur like this guy you're going to want to do outbound sales.It's also worth noting that this guys is mostly doing small deals. The literal largest price he has on his pricing page is 72k/yr, which isn't tiny, but his typical deal size is likely much smaller, so it makes total sense for him not to get on a call for $49/month, because that is not a scalable strategy.But many enterprise b2b companies have a more complicated product than Keygen and charge orders of magnitude more than they do.Which is not to say that he is wrong, it's just that this is the correct strategy for scaling a low ACV product, rather than a high ACV product. And a low ACV product has to have much broader demand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In most of these discussions, people on the sales side claim, "but our customers WANT this! Trust us!" and most of the people on the buying side scream, "We hate this. Please let us buy it without this song and dance."
It's a shocking disconnect to me.
(For what it's worth, I'm squarely on the fouder/engineering buying side and hate the call song and dance, and only engage in it as a last resort.)Parting thought: SpaceX tells you how much it costs to ship something INTO SPACE. I bet you can figure out a way to tell me your SaaS price, in ballpark terms, and what it depends upon...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725385</guid></item><item><title>2.

Virtually every day was the same. Very clear. Very still.I’m not sure if anyone could ever “get” one of his movies completely beyond the experience and the narrative. He always left so much unsaid and open to interpretation, just like life. They are movies designed to make the viewer feel a certain way, rather than literally what’s in the screen. He was one of the few directors that I thought of as making weird things that I would enjoy (most of the time), but how could anyone else?“I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the pandemic David Lynch released a daily weather video in which he reported what the weather was at his home in Los Angeles.First video was May 11, 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krIj6eLF4mULast video was December 16, 2022: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l21GFyOO8UgHe also released a daily video in which he drew a bingo number.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to abandon social media algorithms in favor of using RSS feeds for content consumption. It emphasizes the benefits of RSS, such as increased control over the content one engages with and reduced exposure to negative influences of algorithm-driven platforms. The author argues that RSS fosters a more intentional and curated online experience, allowing users to connect with the content and creators they genuinely appreciate, rather than being dictated by algorithms that prioritize engagement over relevance. Overall, the piece encourages readers to consider the switch to RSS for a more personalized and fulfilling way to consume information online.&lt;/p&gt;

You can can create an RSS feed from Reddit.You can't to my best knowledge create an RSS feed anymore from TwitterNewsletter to RSS: https://kill-the-newsletter.com/More stuff:Blogs &amp; RSS

https://code.rosaelefanten.org/rssparser.lisp/dir?ci=tipThis one you have to pay. I am considering it. Some RSS feeds don't work on my TinyTinyRSS. I think cloudflare, like always, is killing it:https://politepol.com/en/pricesPS: If you have an idea for a RSS reader domain, please suggest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good algorithm is a good thing. However what a good algorithm is for me is often different from what it is for those who maintain them. Outrage gets attention and sometimes it is needed, but there is a level of too much, and also a lot of outrage unfairly represents the issues and so it makes me mad even though if I understood the details I wouldn't be mad just concerned.I want an algorithm that surfaces things of interest to me, then says "you have seen it all, go outside" (with an option of if I'm confined to a hospital bed to go on).  Algorithm maintainers want me to keep scrolling for more ad dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a big proponent of RSS, but I think that it suffers from a lack of imagination these days, for example, the "quality filter" approach mentioned in this article is not very useful imo.The biggest cost of RSS feed items as a consumer is figuring out whether something is worth reading. A lot of feeds these days don't provide anything useful in the body to make a determination on this, and others just dump the entire contents in the body, which means you're wasting a bunch of time reading N% of something until you realize you're not interested in it and it can be skipped.In addition to this, RSS feeds tend to be structured to just throw everything at you, regardless of the topics you are interested in.For a few years I have been publishing my own topic-specific feeds[1] for others to consume where I fill the body with my own personal highlights from the source, with a link through to the source (ie. the things I found interesting, the "hooks" that give a quick signal to a consumer if this might be something they want to invest time in reading). They have a couple of die-hard consumers, but ultimately this really a case of a niche within a niche.I wish there were more feeds like this for me as a consumer, but unfortunately I get the feeling that this idea will never really become popular enough to catch on widely as RSS becomes less and less relevant to the mainstream.[1]: my software development topic RSS feed for example: https://notado.app/feeds/jado/software-development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724284</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haha, this would be an amazing way to test the ChatGPT crawler reflective DDOS vulnerability [1] I published last week.Basically a single HTTP Request to ChatGPT API can trigger 5000 HTTP requests by ChatGPT crawler to a website.The vulnerability is/was thoroughly ignored by OpenAI/Microsoft/BugCrowd but I really wonder what would happen when ChatGPT crawler interacts with this tarpit several times per second. As ChatGPT crawler is using various Azure IP ranges I actually think the tarpit would crash first.The vulnerability reporting experience with OpenAI / BugCrowd was really horrific. It's always difficult to get attention for DOS/DDOS vulnerabilities and companies always act like they are not a problem. But if their system goes dark and the CEO calls then suddenly they accept it as a security vulnerability.I spent a week trying to reach OpenAI/Microsoft to get this fixed, but I gave up and just published the writeup.I don't recommend you to exploit this vulnerability due to legal reasons.[1] https://github.com/bf/security-advisories/blob/main/2025-01-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having first run a bot motel in I think 2005, I'm thrilled and greatly entertained to see this taking off. When I first did it, I had crawlers lost in it literally for days; and you could tell that eventually some human would come back and try to suss the wreckage. After about a year I started seeing URLs like ../this-page-does-not-exist-hahaha.html. Sure it's an arms race but just like security is generally an afterthought these days, don't think that you can't be the woodpecker which destroys civilization. The comments are great too, this one in particular reflects my personal sentiments:&gt;  the moment it becomes the basic default install ( ala adblocker in browsers for people ), it does not matter what the bigger players want to do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had our non-profit website drained out of bandwidth and site closed temporarily (!!) from our hosting deal because of Amazon bot aggressively crawling like ?page=21454 ... etc.Gladly Siteground restored our site without any repercussions as it was not our fault. Added Amazon bot into robots.txt after that one.Don't like how things are right now. Is a tarpit the solution? Or better laws? Would they stop the chinese bots? Should they even? I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725147</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see that Nintendo is treating the switch more like how they traditionally handled their mobile platforms instead of their consoles.Iterating instead of throwing out everything with each new version. There is a part of me that is going to miss the, do weird shit and see what works, Nintendo that brought us some really fun ideas. But a stable Nintendo just being able to continue putting out great games has its advantages.I am curious about the specs, but honestly don't care much. The only real issue the Switch had was being able to keep up with some of the games put on it with FPS but it still had beautiful games (like Tears of the Kingdom). So as long as it is actually a decent spec bump I am happy and have zero care to compare it to the other consoles (but I am sure people are going too and scream that it is "underpowered").The biggest thing I am curious about, will it be OLED since that will be disappointing to go back to non OLED from the OLED Switch. And Price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a lot of frustration with Switch joy-cons. Not only drift, which has claimed a number of them, but also issues with the console not recognizing when they are attached, and one pair that for some reason the switch won't recognize when trying to use in the horizontal orientation. No doubt my kids have subjected it to hard use and probably a drop or two, but still frustrating.It looks like they've added some reinforcement to the joysticks, and changed the connection with the main body to be magnetic instead of sliding in and out (which causes wear and tear on the connectors over time). I hope the Switch 2 is more robust than the original Switch.Some extra horsepower would also be appreciated. Recently we were trying to play Switch Sports with 4 players, and even my kids who are generally oblivious to graphical fidelity and framerate were complaining that it was basically unplayable in 4-player split screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't like the aesthetic as much as the Switch 1. Looks a little too sleek, too monochrome, not Nintendo-y enough. Other than the splash of color around the thumbsticks it looks like any number of those handheld Steam Deck-alikes that have been coming out.That said I always wait for the special Zelda editions of Nintendo's consoles, so I don't know that I have standing to complain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724621</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fundamentals of memory management in computer systems, emphasizing its critical role in efficiently allocating and managing memory resources for applications. It covers key concepts such as memory allocation, fragmentation, and garbage collection, along with different strategies employed for managing memory, including stack and heap allocation. The author aims to provide a clear understanding of how memory management works and its impact on system performance, along with insights into common challenges faced in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't proper usage of realloc:    lines = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

In case it cannot service the reallocation and returns NULL, it will overwrite "lines" with NULL, but the memory that "lines" referred to is still there and needs to be either freed or used.The proper way to call it would be:    tmp = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(lines);
        lines = NULL;
        // ... possibly exit the program (without a memory leak)
    } else {
        lines = tmp;
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example strdup implementation:  char *strdup(const char *str) { 
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    char *retval = malloc(len);
    if (!retval) {
      return NULL; 
    }
    strcpy(retval, str);
    return retval;
  }

Has a very common defect.  The malloc call does not reserve enough space for the NUL byte required for successful use of strcpy, thus introducing heap corruption.Also, assuming a NULL pointer is bitwise equal to 0 is not portable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for such a detailed article.In my spare time working with C as a hobby I am usually in "vertical mode" which is different to how I would work (carefully) at work, which is just getting things done end-to-end as fast as possible, not careful at every step that we have no memory errors. So I am just trying to get something working end-to-end so I do not actually worry about memory management when writing C. So I let the operating system handle memory freeing. I am trying to get the algorithm working in my hobby time.And since I wrote everything in Python or Javascript initially, I am usually porting from Python to C.If I were using Rust, it would force me to be careful in the same way, due to the borrow checker.I am curious: we have reference counting and we have Profile guided optimisation.Could "reference counting" be compiled into a debug/profiled build and then detect which regions of time we free things in before or after (there is a happens before relation with dropping out of scopes that reference counting needs to run) to detect where to insert frees? (We Write timing metadata from the RC build, that encapsulates the happens before relationships)Then we could recompile with a happens-before relation file that has correlations where things should be freed to be safe.EDIT: Any discussion about those stack diagrams and alignment should include a link to this wikipedia page;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683616</guid></item><item><title>8.

Materials are being stressed so much while trying to defy the laws of physics that the smallest angle error, the smallest pressure mismatch, smallest timing error, and boom. This did not happen when we were inventing cars, trains and air planes. Now imagine these risks, while you're halfway to mars. Is it possible that we just have no found/invented the right materials or the right fuel/propulsion mechanism to de-risk this, and that is where we should be allocating a lot more resources?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731091</guid></item><item><title>9. 2k-year-old wine and the uncanny immediacy of the past</title><link>https://resobscura.substack.com/p/2000-year-old-wine-and-the-uncanny</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fascinating story of a 2,000-year-old wine found in a Roman tomb, delving into its historical significance, the science behind ancient winemaking, and the connection between culture and memory. It reflects on the uncanny experience of tasting such an ancient beverage, contemplating the themes of time, preservation, and the impact of history on the present. Through this narrative, the writer highlights the interplay between archaeology and sensory experiences, suggesting that ancient artifacts can evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article about artifacts that make the past more immediate, that allow us to connect our experiences to people hundreds or thousands of years ago.My favorite example is the writings of Onfim, who was a little boy in the 1200s in present day Russia whose scribbling and homework were exquisitely preserved on birch bark fragments. It’s so immediately recognizable as a little boy’s endearing doodles about knights and imaginary beasts, yet its 800 years old.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree these objects (just like colourised photos) help bridge the distance to the past. But I've had the same experience purely with text. If you read Cicero's letters and diaries, and then just imagine him - suffering writer's block, wracked with anxiety and self-doubt, desperate for his friends to cheer him up - as a neurotic, terminally-online Twitter user, it fits perfectly and breathes life into his every word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating! The wine discovery reminds me one scene from the book 'The Dark Forest'[0] when the protagonist drinks a wine from some centuries before... spoiler: it wasn't good.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717393</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the context of large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the importance of TDD as an approach to improve software quality and maintainability by writing tests before code. The author explains how applying TDD principles to LLMs can enhance their reliability and performance, detailing methodologies for implementing TDD with these models. The post also explores potential challenges and considerations when adopting TDD for LLMs, ultimately advocating for its practice to foster better development outcomes in AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One trend I've noticed, framed as a logical deduction:1. Coding assistants based on o1 and Sonnet are pretty great at coding with &lt;50k context, but degrade rapidly beyond that.2. Coding agents do massively better when they have a test-driven reward signal.3. If a problem can be framed in a way that a coding agent can solve, that speeds up development at least 10x from the base case of human + assistant.4. From (1)-(3), if you can get all the necessary context into 50k tokens and measure progress via tests, you can speed up development by 10x.5. Therefore all new development should be microservices written from scratch and interacting via cleanly defined APIs.Sure enough, I see HN projects evolving in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a similar note, has anyone found themselves absolutely not trusting non-code LLM output?The code is at least testable and verifiable. For everything else I am left wondering if it's the truth or a hallucination. It incurs more mental burden that I was trying to avoid using LLM in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have yet to see an LLM + TDD essay where the author demonstrates any mastery of Test Driven Development.Is the label "TDD" being hijacked for something new? Did that already happen? Are LLMs now responsible for defining TDD?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726584</guid></item><item><title>11.

Now it's ridding yourself of the baggage of an almost-dead platform that you're about to make fully dead.Still appreciate getting the tooling as FOSS rather than just terminating it, but let's not go for delusions here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42721442</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Shopify's five-year journey using React Native, highlighting how the platform has benefited from the framework in developing mobile applications. It details the challenges and successes encountered during this period, including performance improvements, enhancements in user experience, and the advantages of cross-platform development. The piece also emphasizes insights gained and future plans for further leveraging React Native to improve application development processes at Shopify. Overall, it showcases the impact of React Native on Shopify’s mobile strategy and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with most of the other comments here, and it sounds like Shopify made sound tradeoffs for their business. I'm sure the people who use Shopify's apps are able to accomplish the tasks they need to.But as a user of computers and occasional native mobile app developer, hearing "&lt;500ms screen load times" stated as a win is very disappointing. Having your app burn battery for half a second doing absolutely nothing is bad UX. That kind of latency does have a meaningful effect on productivity for a heavy user.Besides that, having done a serious evaluation of whether to migrate a pair of native apps supported by multi-person engineering teams to RN, I think this is a very level-headed take on how to make such a migration work in practice. If you're going to take this path, this is the way to do it. I just hope that people choose targets closer to 100ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the section on the importance of native devs and how they're staffing mobile was really interesting:"Native devs are crucialMobile engineers who specialize in iOS and Android are essential to building great mobile apps. There is no replacing experience and taste that comes from having built many mobile products and deeply understanding conventions and usability. Being able to drop down to the platform layer, write bindings, master build &amp; release, distribution, etc requires native expertise.They also play a vital role in optimizing app performance across the myriad of device models, ensuring a consistent user experience for all users. Additionally, native expertise is essential for managing React Native version updates, as well as adopting new features, APIs, and tooling changes that accompany new iOS and Android releases. You can't build a good product without these experts.We invested in training our native mobile developers in React Native through a self-serve course that covered everything they needed to know to ship production-ready code. Additionally, we set up office hours with developers who were already proficient in React Native to provide support through Q&amp;A sessions, pair programming, and code reviews.We also supplemented our mobile teams with some web developers for their Javascript, Typescript, and React expertise. This ensured we had strong expertise in both native and React Native, and over time, it levelled up the entire team.Having a good mix of native and web developers is the key to building great mobile apps using React Native in our experience. "&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that there was no mention of Expo. In the past, I would say bare-metal is better than Expo-managed React Native projects because of the limitations when it came to native modules. Fast forward to today, and anything you can do in a bare metal RN app can be done with Expo.The biggest game-changer recently is Expo's Continuous Native Generation[0]. You can configure all of your native modules and ios/android files with a simple config file (which has its limits, whereby you'll need to write an Expo Config Plugin[1]). You will no longer commit the ios/android native code to your repository, and instead let it be procedurally built.This resolved a lot of environment issues developers would often run into, and greatly simplified onboarding new devs. You can build your iOS/Android apps through the CI with ease. And you'll no longer be afraid of upgrading React Native, as Expo will handle all of the breaking changes in the native code for you.My guess is that Shopify started with bare metal React Native apps (which I would have done the same 5 years ago), and now migrating back to Expo-managed projects is nontrivial. At my work we only manage one app, and it was well worth migrating back.[0] https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/[1] https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690114</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have discovered a new method for arranging spheres in a way that enhances the understanding of how they can "kiss" or touch each other. The research uncovers novel configurations of spheres, revealing complex mathematical structures and relationships that challenge existing theories of sphere packing. This finding not only deepens insight into geometric and topological properties but also has potential implications in various fields such as physics and materials science, emphasizing the intricate patterns and behaviors of spatial arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd really love to know what the mathematicians are actually doing when they work this stuff out? Is it all on computers now? Can they somehow visualize 24-dimensional-sphere-packings in their minds? Are they maybe rigorously checking results of a 'test function' that tells them they found a correct/optimal packing? I would love to know more about what the day-to-day work involved in this type of research actually would be!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interesting ta for me:&gt; Had she been one of his graduate students, he would have tried harder to convince her to work on something else. “If they work on something hopeless, it’ll be bad for their career,” he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's strange the article doesn't even mention just trying to simulate the problem computationally.Surely it's not too difficult to repeatedly place spheres around a central sphere in 17 dimensions, maximizing how many kiss for each new sphere added, until you get a number for how many fit? And add some randomness to the choices to get a range of answers Monte Carlo-style, to then get some idea of the lower bound? [Edit: I meant upper bound, whoops.]Obviously ideally you want to discover a mathematically regular approach if you can. But surely computation must also play a role here in narrowing down reasonable bounds for the problem?And computation will of course be essential if the answer turns out to be chaotic for certain numbers of dimensions, if the optimal solution is just a jumble without any kind of symmetry at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42723406</guid></item><item><title>14.

These applications are eye-wateringly expensive-- like similar in pricing to top-class EDA software licenses.With the abundance GPU's and modern UI's, I wonder how much work would be involved for someone to make optical design software that blows away the old tools. It would be ray-tracing, but with interesting complications like accounting for polarization, diffraction, scattering, fluorescence, media effects beyond refraction like like birefringence and stuff like Kerr and Pockels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this book so much. The literate programming style I think inspired from Knuth's cweb, great writing, beautiful high-quality physical book worth buying but also free access to knowledge. The literate-programming style means you are almost immediately applying theory to a practical system, I keep having to take breaks to learn outside math/physics though, but it is self-contained in principle I think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This and https://hint.userweb.mwn.de/understanding_mp3/index.html are both amazingly fun examples of literate programming that I recommend all of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683731</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comments here are focused on how much energy it would take to turn this into fuel. The real story here is decentralized fertilizer production, buried at the end of the article:&gt; this innovation could fundamentally reshape fertilizer manufacturing by providing a more sustainable, cost-effective alternative to centralized productionThe high energy cost of Haber-Bosch, plus the additional cost of transportation from manufacturer to farmer could potentially be eliminated by distributed, passive fertilizer generators scattered around in the fields.I'm no expert, but assuming sufficient local production, low concentration could potentially be overcome by continuous fertilization with irrigation throughout the growing season.Let's find out. Some quick fiddling with a molarity calculator and an almanac:-- 100 uM ammonia -&gt; 1.7 mg / L ammonia-- 82% nitrogen -&gt; 1.4 mg / L nitrogen-- My lawn needs around 1 lb / 1000 sq ft, or around 5 g / m2-- So my lawn needs about 3500 L / m2 of fertilized irrigation total for the season-- Ballpark farming irrigation is around 0.2 inches per day, or around 5L/m2I would need to water my lawn about 700 days in the year, or more realistically up my irrigation rate by about a factor of 4, AND source all of the water from the fertilizer box.I'm a little skeptical that I can allocate space for enough production and still have a lawn left to fertilize. The tech probably isn't ready for the big time on an industrial farm yet, but for research demo, this seems like a promising direction! Much more than concentrating it for fuel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions "Traditional methods for ammonia production require high temperatures and pressures" in reference to the existing Haber-Bosch process for producing NH3 from thin air, an interesting historic story on its own.https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-breadhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73464/the-alchemy-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are these really catalysts in the traditional definition of the word? Meaning that the catalyst is non-sacrificial? This appears to be suggesting that nitration can be done with atomospheric N2 simply with the right catalyst. But N2 is triple bonded, and the lowest theoretical threshold to react N2 with anything is by breaking at least one of those bonds, which is incredibly energy intensive even under theoretically optimal conditions.Some of the most promising research in replacing Haber-Bosch is actually plasma-assisted nitration, which is basically just as energy intensive as Haber-Bosch, but with drastically lower capital requirements...something that could be done in your backyard. I struggle to see how an ATP catalyst-only method could even do anything close to breaking an N2 triple bond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725823</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Oh Shit, Git! is a resource designed to help users understand and resolve common Git mistakes. The website provides straightforward explanations and practical solutions for issues like accidental commits, unintentional branch changes, and complex merges. It covers various scenarios that can cause frustration for both beginners and experienced Git users, offering step-by-step commands to fix problems and recover lost work effectively. The aim is to empower users with the knowledge to handle errors confidently and improve their Git proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some changes I would make:1. Always use `git switch` instead of `git checkout`2. Avoid `reset --hard` at all costs. So for the "accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch" issue, I would do this instead:    # create a new branch from the current state of master
    git branch some-new-branch-name
    # switch to the previous commit
    git switch -d HEAD~
    # overwrite master branch to that commit instead
    git switch -C master
    # switch to the work branch you created
    git switch some-new-branch-name
    # your commit lives in this branch now :)

3. I'd apply the same to the `cherry-pick` version of "accidentally committed to the wrong branch":    git switch name-of-the-correct-branch
    # grab the last commit to master
    git cherry-pick master
    # delete it from master
    git switch -d master~
    git switch -C master

4. And also to the "git-approved" way for "Fuck this noise, I give up.":    # get the lastest state of origin
    git fetch origin
    # reset tracked files
    git restore -WS .
    # delete untracked files and directories
    git clean -d --force
    # reset master to remote version
    git switch -d origin/master
    git switch -C master
    # repeat for each borked branch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should start recommending UIs as the default way to learn  Git. It would solve a third of these problems and another third wouldn't even come up.If you later decide that the CLI is faster, go ahead. But first, people need to see visually how they can interact with the tree.I like fork.dev, but most clients are pretty similar at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe I have a good mental model of what git does, but I never remember commands' arguments to use when they are moderately complex. I mean that the commands are not discoverable or easy to memorize.I don't know if that's because the text UI is bad, or because it's simply difficult to explain with text what to do to manipulate a tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728916</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of interest and relevance: This past semester, Andy Pavlo's DB seminar at CMU explored a number of projects under the heading 'Database Building Blocks', starting with  DataFusion and several of its applications.  Take a listen!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjZc2AdXq_Lc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a cambrian explosion in data processing engines: DataFusion, Polars, DuckDB, Feldera, Pathway, and more than i can remember.It reminds of 15 years ago where there was JDBC/ODBC for data. Then when data volumes increased, specialized databases became viable - graph, document, json, key-value, etc.I don't see SQL and Spark hammers keeping their ETL monopolies for much longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like I'm not the target audience for this. When I have large data, then I directly write SQL queries and run them against the database. It's impossible to improve performance when you have to go out to the DB anyway; might as well have it run the query too. Certainly the server ops and db admins have loads more money to spend on making the DB fast compared with my anti-virus laden corporate laptop.When I have small data that fits on my laptop, Pandas is good enough.Maybe 10% of the time I have stuff that's annoyingly slow to run with Pandas; then I might choose a different library, but needing this is rare. Even then, of that 10% you can solve 9% of that by dropping down to numpy and picking a better algorithm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675804</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin successfully achieved orbital flight with its New Glenn rocket for the first time, marking a significant milestone for the company. The rocket, named after the famed science fiction author Jules Verne, is designed to carry large payloads to space and aims to compete in the growing commercial launch market. The launch demonstrated advanced technology and capabilities, paving the way for future missions and establishing Blue Origin as a serious player in the aerospace industry. The success of this launch could lead to increased opportunities for both commercial and governmental satellite projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty unusual for a new space company to make orbit on their first launch.  Generally par for the course in established companies is 2 failures in the first 10 launches so lets see how they do.The stage didn't land successfully but I'd have been very surprised if they got that on the first try.NG's launch price is supposedly only about 50% higher than a Falcon 9 with a lot more payload weight and volume.  Hopefully this will result in SpaceX cutting their price, they've got a lot of room to do so before hitting their launch costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the cameras used film like NASA did for Saturn V. The digital cameras used on these launches basically show a white blob with no detail due to digital cameras having such low dynamic range compared to film. And this is made worse with the night launches that Blue Origin are doing.In Saturn V launches you could see see detail in the bright flame structures along with background detail.Maybe some of the upcoming digital cameras chips will have higher dynamic range eventually. I know Nikon has a paper talking about stacked sensors that are trading off high frame rate for high dynamic range: https://youtu.be/jcc1CvqCTeU?si=DuIu4BK48iZTlyB2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a pretty hardcore SpaceX fan but hats off to the BlueOrigin team. Orbit on the first try is no small feat. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42722756</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reuploaded the PDF here - https://nokia-apple-iphone-was-launched-presentation.tiiny.s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there as this played out. Nokia had a lot of good software and software engineers but not the management structure to do anything good with that.Nokia was huge as an organization and parts of that organization recognized the threat early on. The problem was at the board and executive level. These people had a blind spot for software. They thought they were still in the electronics business. Lots of people with an electronics and radio background. Not a lot of people with software competence. And they had bought into the notion that Symbian was going to magically fix all their problems.A lot of effort was spent on looking for other solutions. And one of the things that was good (Linux) around 2005 was actually quite close to displacing Symbian as the key future proof replacement for their legacy platforms. Symbian was just rolling out for a few years and they had made a big investment in that. And management (those same people with a huge blind spot for software) backed the wrong horse.Linux never really died in Nokia but it wasn't allowed to prosper either. Devices were cancelled or repurposed for Symbian. This happened to the N8, for example. By the time they switched to windows phone, they actually had two Linux platforms (Meego and Meltemi) and an Android phone in the works as well. Meego had one last product phone launch and the team and platform were killed in the same week. Any devices for that platform were labeled as developer phones. Nokia never marketed them as a consumer phone. Meltemi never saw any product launch at all; it was aimed at feature phones. Both were good ideas but poorly executed. Nokia killed them along with Symbian in order to back windows phone. Classic baby and bathwater situation.And MS ended up killing the one Nokia Android phone that was launched shortly before they acquired the whole phone division. Kind of a desperate/ballsy move. I suspect Nokia did this as a stick to ensure MS followed through with the acquisition. That was their "oh we could just switch from windows phone to Android unless.. " move. Nokia was at point the only OEM that still believed in Windows Phone.MS killed the whole division shortly after Satya Nadella took over and was sorting out the mess left by Steve Ballmer. The iphone was solidly in charge by then and the rest of the market was Android. Courtesy of lots of Linux contributions by the Meego and Maemo team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Palm when the iPhone launched, and one note from this analysis summed up Apple's new power in the market and how they really changed the landscape."Cingular has allowed Apple to launch a device with WLAN and inbuilt services"At that time, the carriers controlled so much of the cell phone experience. We certainly would have loved to have launched Palm Treo phones with WiFi radios, but our carrier partners wanted the only way to get data in and out of the devices to be through their monetized data plans.  They also wanted to control what you did with that data so they could charge for their own email or messaging systems or web portals.  The same applied to app stores.  Palm OS didn't have a unified app store at that time, just sideloading and some third-party methods, and some carriers had started making their own stores where you could buy apps billed through your cell phone bill.  They hated the idea of a platform owning that, and I expect that was part of the reason Apple originally released it with no app store.  They needed the phone to be a massive hit in order to gain the power to also bypass that wall that the cell companies put up.Palm did benefit from the iPhone launch -- it had us uplevel our efforts away from the post-Palm OS phones that we were in the middle of developing that were aimed at the RIM market and instead try something radical with webOS, and when the Pre launched, it actually had WiFi on board, although the Sprint-exclusive Pixi phone lacked WiFi due to carrier request.  There was some momentum there for a while, but then HP bought us, hit its own set of brick walls with carriers, and ditched the hardware business shortly after Apple started launching on other carriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724761</guid></item><item><title>20.

The introduction says that they train on 37 million real and synthetic images. Are astronauts riding horses now represented in the training data more than would have been possible 5 years ago?If it's possible to get good, generalizable results from such (relatively) small data sets, I'd like to see what this approach can do if trained exclusively on non-synthetic permissively licensed inputs. It might be possible to make a good "free of any possible future legal challenges" image generator just from public domain content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The estimated training time for the end-to-end model on an 8×H100 machine is 2.6 days.That's a $250,000 machine for the micro budget. Or if you don't want to do it locally ~$2,000 to do it on someone else's machine for the one model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681793</guid></item><item><title>21.

Feels like something built in Flash during Nokia's heady days. (Unintentional irony? Nokia was known as a company with lots of Flash concepts and little software product execution.)But the content seems really interesting. These are internal prototypes and documents from Nokia's archive, now released for the first time. I wish there was a way to browse them in chronological order without all this janky graph visualization nonsense.There's a link in the corner that takes you to the actual archive repository:https://repo.aalto.fi/index.php?name=SO_b66a9391-dcf8-4399-8...This seems like it might be a less brain-melting way to browse the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a mess of a webpage. Probably there is interesting content there but the presentation made me close it down immediatley.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UI for this does seem a bit "Baby's first force-directed graph".

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons why some digital services provided by the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) experience outages during nighttime hours. It highlights the challenges related to system maintenance and updates that are often scheduled during off-peak periods to minimize user disruption. The piece emphasizes the importance of these maintenance activities for improving service reliability but acknowledges the inconvenience it may cause to users seeking access to DVLA services at night. Overall, it sheds light on the balance between operational efficiency and user accessibility for government digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent bit of pragmatism and as a user of this service I’m happy with the trade off.People wondering why it’s not a simple switch and “there must be something else going on here” have clearly never worked with layers of legacy systems where the data actually matters. Sure it’s fixable and it’s a shame it hasn’t been but don’t assume there aren’t very good reasons why it’s not a quick fix.The gov.uk team have moved mountains over the past decade, members of it have earned the right to be believed when they say “it’s not simple”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something is missing here, why do batch jobs take 13 hours? If this thing was started on an old mainframe why isn't the downtime just 5 minutes at 3:39 AM?Exactly how much data is getting processed?Edit: Why does rebuilding take a decade or more? This is not a complex system. It doesn't need to solve any novel engineering challenges to operate efficiently. Article does not give much insight into why this particular task couldn't be fixed in 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often ran into this when using DVLA services and spluttered with indignation. But at the end of the day, these services are fantastically usable (during the daytime) and I appreciate Dafydd pushing to just get them out there!I got my license in 2015 so never in my life have I had the apparently ubiquitous American experience of queuing at the DMV and filling in paper forms. (is this still real? or limited to stand-up comedy?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676545</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So Minimax just "open-sourced" (I add it in "" because they have a custom license for its use and I've not read through that) but they have context length of 4-million tokens and it scored 100% on the needle in a haystack problem. It uses lightning attention - so still attention, just a variation? So this is potentially not as groundbreaking as the publishers of the paper hoped or am I missing something fundamental here? Can this scale better? Does it train more efficiently? The test-time inference is amazing - is that what sets this apart and not necessarily the long context capability? Will it hallucinate a lot less because it stores long-term memory more efficiently and thus won't make up facts but rather use what it has remembered in context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;similar to RWKV7’s new (sub quadratic) attention mechanism which models key values as v≈kS’ and does an in-context descent on ||v - kS’||^2/2 (where the state matrix S is one attentional head) , explained more by the author here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/main/RWKV-...and i tried to unpack it a bit here https://wdmn.fr/rank-1-take-on-rwkv7s-in-context-learning/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the title I thought this was talking about cramming the night before an exam. ;-) Or if it’s an open book exam learning during the exam as one goes through the textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718166</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN! I'm the developer at Jamsocket who made this. In case you're not familiar with Yjs, it's a CRDT library for building collaborative and local-first apps.The thing is, if you're not used to working with distributed state there's definitely a learning curve. Even simple things like incrementing a counter — the "hello world" of JavaScript framework demos — get tricky when dealing with multiple clients. Worse, a lot of tutorials are just like "install this library and text editor integration and boom you have an app", which doesn't give you a good mental model for what's actually happening.So we made Learn Yjs! It's an interactive Yjs tutorial. I wanted it to be really intuitive for people just getting their feet wet with local-first development, so there are lots of explorable demos and coding exercises. The idea is to use interactive examples to build an understanding from the ground up.Hope you like it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yjs is nice. Easy to get p2p results.Yjs backend, its persistence, eventual conflict resolution (one of editors stayed too long offline), history rewind seems like a tough engineering challenge to crack.Always wanted to have a nice experience with block editor like Platejs https://platejs.org/There are nice attempts simplify dev experience with solutions like Liveblocks https://liveblocks.io/text-editor However most options come at the expense of controlling your data.CRDT keyword search on HN bring consistently good results and interest in the topic, but no good options on open source backend side. Checked it many times in the past. Please correct me if I missed something.https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=tru...Most people expectations it should work at least as in Google Docs or Notion, and on the dev side it should be store privately in Postgres JSONB like format without going deep into details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The trick is a technique called fractional indexing, in which indices are fractions rather than integers.How many times you can use fractional indexing before it stops working?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731582</guid></item><item><title>28.

If you just loaded some protein with a similar MW / migration / concentration as the one you're trying to spoof, the bands would look more or less indistinguishable. And because it's a real unique band (just with the wrong protein), you wouldn't be able to tell it's been faked using visual inspection.Perhaps this is already happening, and we just don't know it... In this way I've always thought gel images were more susceptible to fraud vs. other commonly faked images (NMR / MS spectra etc, which are harder to spoof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have a playlist of 3500 videos showing images like this onehttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXXK20HE_dV8rBa2h-8P9d-0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728165</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Let's Encrypt's proposal to introduce short-lived certificates with a lifespan of just six days, along with the option for IP address certificates. This initiative aims to enhance security and privacy on the web by reducing the risks associated with long-lived certificates and enabling more flexible certificate issuance for services hosted on IP addresses. The proposal highlights the importance of making the web more secure while addressing challenges in certificate management and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kinda funny to call the current 90 day certs "long lived". When Let's Encrypted started out more than 10 years ago most certs from major vendors had a 1 year life span. Let's Encrypt was (one of) the first to use drastically shorter life spans, hence all the ACME automation effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP certs improve a niche but interesting use case for me. I run a domain registrar that implements a simple OAuth2 protocol[0] for delegating domains/subdomains. I also have an open source tunneling tool called boringproxy that implements the client side of this protocol[1].boringproxy needs to provide a callback redirect_uri to the oauth server in order to retrieve it's token, which it can then use for setting DNS records. However, it can't provide an HTTPS endpoint until it can set up those DNS records and get a cert. Chicken/egg. Currently the spec requires the server to implement a `GET /temp-domain` endpoint which creates a DNS record like 157-245-231-242.example.com which points at the client's IP. This lets boringproxy bootstrap a secure OAuth2 callback endpoint.IP certs would remove an entire step from this process.[0]: https://github.com/takingnames/namedrop-protocol-spec[1]: This is actually broken in boringproxy at the moment, but there's a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hf72-fYTts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember being surprised when Cloudflare launched https://1.1.1.1 with a valid cert and I immediately wanted one, but couldn’t find an easy way to get one.I am gonna try to run a DoH resolver on this and see how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726678</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long ago I worked on the firmware for a game controller. We started getting reports back of ghost inputs like stuck buttons and false presses after we sent some early hardware to media reviewers. Given the power of game media at the time, this was an immediate code red. We took shifts playtesting various video games for nearly a week straight just to try and replicate the issues. No luck, only the reviewers could manifest it. We were about to put reviewers on a plane to demonstrate the issue in person when I decided to clean my desk. In doing so I tossed a bare PCB running debug to the other side of the desk and my console went wild.Turns out the PCBs were shock/pressure sensitive, and the debouncing was just a bit off. Reviewers were getting really into their games and mechanically stressing the controllers. Stressed hard enough, the PCB would bend slightly, causing line level fluctuations and eventually ghost inputs. Back in the office we were just doing a job and not getting too emotionally involved in our playtesting.Some new molds and review units later we shipped the working system. Percussive debugging has solved a number of otherwise intractable bugs over my career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arguably, _The Jargon File_:http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.htmland _Zen and the Art of the Internet_https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34should be a part of the school curriculum covering the internet.While specific to the Mac, one wishes:https://folklore.org/0-index.htmlhttps://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40492.Revolution_in_T...was more widely read (and that it was updated with stories of turning OPENSTEP into Mac OS X), and if there is a similar site for Windows which collected stories such as:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-rev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to track down an old story about the network not working in a firm on Wednesday morning near 7 am.I remember the details being that only on Wednesday did they use the freight elevator to deliver donuts to an all-staff meeting and when they did, the network would fritz.It turned out that if you move a very large electromagnet (on the elevator) along the network cable, it makes the network go crazy.Combine that with cable-pullers that rather than putting holes in multiple ceilings and floors in the cable closet, saw that the elevator shaft was a pre-existing hole between floors anyway, simply took the path of least resistance and hilarity (and a real hard network debugging problem) ensues.Does anyone know when or where this anecdote occurred ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673766</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What’s unique about DBOS’s take on durable execution (compared to, say, Temporal) is that it’s implemented in a lightweight library that’s totally backed by Postgres. All you have to do to use DBOS is “npm install” it and annotate your program with decorators. The decorators store your program’s execution state in Postgres as it runs and recover it if it crashes. There are no other dependencies you have to manage, no separate workflow server–just your program and Postgres.this is good until you the postgres server fills up with load and need to scale up/fan out work to a bunch of workers? how do you handle that?(disclosure, former temporal employee, but also no hate meant, i'm all for making more good orcehstration choices)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could you genericise the requirement in postgresql and provide a storage interface we could plug into? I think I have a use for this in Polykey (https://GitHub.com/MatrixAI/Polykey) but we use rocksdb (transactional key value embedded db).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello!

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "What Every Hacker Should Know: TLB Invalidation" provides insights into the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and its critical role in memory management during hacking and exploitation scenarios. It explains the significance of TLB invalidation in mitigating certain attacks, particularly those that involve memory access patterns. The article outlines various techniques employed by hackers to manipulate memory and emphasizes the importance of understanding TLB behavior for both defending against and executing exploits. Additionally, it highlights the implications of TLB-related vulnerabilities on system security and offers recommendations for developers and security professionals to enhance their defenses against such threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation (not KVM) mode, the IMUL opcode still fails its IMUL opcode emulation after an XOR opcode (also within the same TLB cached page) modified its neighbor IMUL operand(s).TLB got double-invalidated yet some say never invalidated.  The crux is a glitch within a singlr entire TLB invalidation operation thereby negating XOR opcode's ability to self-modify the neighboring IMUL operand. (Double ROT13, anyone?). I assert double-invalidation because within the same TLB invalidation stroke, XOR operation got performed ... twice, as opposed to retrieving and restoring original IMUL operand value after such invalidation thereby negating XOR computed result EITHER WAY.A failure of self-modifying code within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation mode could be a useful test to determine if one is under QEMU emulation mode, of course if the page allows read-write-execute as often found in JavaScript, Java, Python and Dalvik (Android) bytecode memory regions.Fabrice Bellard, author of QEMU, acknowledged the basic of above but failed amd64/x86 IMUL/XOR self-modify premise in emulation (not KVM) mode of QEMU.https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/364&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be interested to see this written for reading (as opposed to presenting).  Inferring the speaker's meaning from raw slides is a little challenging.  I've had to interact with the minutiae of the x86 TLB in a past life, but happily have forgotten most of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elaborate memory management (paging) systems need caching of lookups

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses OpenAI's failure to implement an opt-out system for photographers regarding the use of their images in training AI models. It highlights concerns from artists and photographers about the unauthorized use of their work and the lack of control they have over how their images are utilized by AI systems. The piece emphasizes the ongoing debate about copyright, ownership, and consent in the age of artificial intelligence, pointing out the need for clearer policies to protect creators' rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No way OpenAI will ever “good citizen” this. Tools to opt out of training sets will only come if they are legally compelled. Governments will have to make respecting some sort of training preference header on public content mandatory I think.The fact that photographers have to independently submit each piece of work they wanted excluded along with detailed descriptions just shows how much they DONT want anyone excluding content from their training data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't even understand why it's everyone elses problem to opt-out.Eventually - for how many of these AI companies would a person have to track down their opt-out processes just to protect their work from AI?  That's crazy.OpenAI should be contacting every single one and asking for permission - like everyone has to in order to use a person's work. How they are getting away with this is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s safe to assume anything Sam A says is an outright lie by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718850</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines a proposed framework for the diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across various sectors to enhance innovation and competitive advantage. It emphasizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders, including government, industry, and academia, to establish guidelines that ensure the ethical use and effective deployment of AI. The framework aims to address challenges related to AI adoption, such as data management, regulatory compliance, and workforce development, while promoting best practices and fostering a sustainable environment for AI advancements. Public comments are invited to refine and improve the framework before its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea if comments actually have any impact, but here is the comment I left on the document:I am Christopher Kanan, a professor and AI researcher at the University of Rochester with over 20 years of experience in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Previously, I led AI research and development at Paige, a medical AI company, where I worked on FDA-regulated AI systems for medical imaging. Based on this experience, I would like to provide feedback on the proposed export control regulations regarding compute thresholds for AI training, particularly models requiring 10^26 computational operations.The current regulation seems misguided for several reasons. First, it assumes that scaling models automatically leads to something dangerous. This is a flawed assumption, as simply increasing model size and compute does not necessarily result in harmful capabilities. Second, the 10^26 operations threshold appears to be based on what may be required to train future large language models using today’s methods. However, future advances in algorithms and architectures could significantly reduce the computational demands for training such models. It is unlikely that AI progress will remain tied to inefficient transformer-based models trained on massive datasets. Lastly, many companies trying to scale large language models beyond systems like GPT-4 have hit diminishing returns, shifting their focus to test-time compute. This involves using more compute to "think" about responses during inference rather than in model training, and the regulation does not address this trend at all.Even if future amendments try to address test-time compute, the proposed regulation seems premature. There are too many unknowns in future AI development to justify using a fixed compute-based threshold as a reliable indicator of potential risk. Instead of focusing on compute thresholds or model sizes, policymakers should focus on regulating specific high-risk AI applications, similar to how the FDA regulates AI software as a medical device. This approach targets the actual use of AI systems rather than their development, which is more aligned with addressing real-world risks.Without careful refinement, these rules risk stifling innovation, especially for small companies and academic researchers, while leaving important developments unregulated. I urge policymakers to engage with industry and academic experts to refocus regulations on specific applications rather than broadly targeting compute usage. AI regulation must evolve with the field to remain effective and balanced.---Of course, I have no skin in the game since I barely have any compute available to me as an academic, but the proposed rules on compute just don't make any sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most salient thing in the document is that it put export controls on releasing the weights of models trained with 10^26 operations. While there may be some errors in my math, I think that corresponds to training a model with over 70,000 H100s for a month.I personally think the regulation is misguided, as it assumes we won't identify better algorithms/architectures. There is no reason to assume that the level of compute leads to these problems.Moreover, given the emphasis on test-time compute nowadays and that it seems like a lot of companies have hit a wall with performance gains with trying to scale LLMs at train-time, I especially think this regulation isn't especially meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This smells a lot like the misguided crypto export laws in the 90s that hampered browser security for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42730126</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex theories and scientific debates surrounding the origin of life on Earth, highlighting various hypotheses such as abiogenesis, the primordial soup theory, and the role of extremophiles. It discusses the challenges in replicating the conditions that led to the first life forms and the significance of recent discoveries in astrobiology and evolutionary biology. The piece emphasizes the ongoing quest to understand life’s beginnings, which remains one of science's most profound mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amino acids are common enough -- glycine has been found in comets and, controversially, even in the interstellar medium.  Other amino acids have also been found in comets.Comet organics, under pressure, can turn into amino acids in situ: https://www.llnl.gov/article/36016/amino-acids-could-be-prod...It's also presumed that cometary ice bombardment is the source of Earth's surface water, as ice or water present any earlier would have boiled off when the planet was young and hot.It's not much of a stretch to imagine that comets brought amino acids, organic compounds, and minerals to Earth as they were bringing water ice.  A lot of those aminos and organics would turn into tar, but some would be protected from UV radiation by that same tar.  With a heat source, maybe some lightning strikes, a good location, and a lot of luck, you get RNA...What we can't yet do is assign a probability or likelihood to this process.  But the ingredients should be common enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never like the emphasis on genetics and information in a lot of origin of life stuff. IMO it is too extensional; what is needed is good intensional reasoning.At the heart of chemical life is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis, this is a great intensional definition of the reproductive side. That just leaves the evolutionary side.What do "genetics" achieve for reproduction. From the autocatalysis point of view, they create a family of "nearby" autocatalytic sets: because different nucleic acid sequences reproduce in much the same way, the conditions needed to propagate one should also propogate another. This in turn makes safer mutations and....Lamarckian inheritance! If you, a microrganism get a good mutation which makes you fit, and then you split, you pass that mutation on.Genetics are sufficient for the above properties, but are they necessary? Probably not! We can probably find other things which have such a "dense/smooth mutation space" with fewer local maxima traps. Perhaps it is fine to say such things definitionally encode information, but IMO information still comes second, philosophically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meanings of both life and intelligence have been obscured by human conceit. We simply cannot accept that we came from what is essentially a random process over eons (which makes it no less extraordinary, but imo far more understandable). The science and math of LLMs and GPTs has been around for a while, but it took time and effort (people putting stuff online plus GPUs) to finally make it usable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726539</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Ashburn, Virginia, has earned the title of the "Data Center Capital of the World" due to its strategic location, access to robust infrastructure, and a favorable regulatory environment. The area benefits from an abundance of fiber optic connectivity, reliable power sources, and proximity to major markets, making it an attractive hub for large tech companies and service providers. Additionally, with its tax incentives and a clustering of data centers, Ashburn has become a preferred site for enterprises looking to enhance their digital capabilities, further solidifying its dominance in the global data center landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We operate nearly 900 servers, and I believe the capital of cloud infrastructure is Amsterdam, NL. The concentration of ASNs in Amsterdam is incredible. In contrast, Ashburn, Dallas, and LA seem to lack ASN diversity, primarily being dominated by singular big tech companies. Cities like Amsterdam, Singapore, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Istanbul, and New York, however, have a greater concentration of smaller cloud hosting businesses, offering more diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real answer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAE-East&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked as a developer for an enterprise hosting company back in 2005.  I took servers out to Ashburn a couple of times.I had visited many data centers in Michigan but this place was at a completely different level.  High level of security and more cages than I had ever seen before.  It was like a little town with street signs so you could find your cage. Lots of logos of famous Internet companies.The fans were so loud my ears were ringing for hours afterward.  This was before the common use of hearing protection and I have no idea how people worked in there all day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684128</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has announced the availability of Linux ARM64 hosted runners for free in public repositories, currently in public preview. This new feature allows developers to build and test their projects on ARM64 architecture, expanding the capabilities of GitHub Actions. Users can now utilize this functionality to enhance their CI/CD workflows, ensuring their applications run efficiently on ARM64 platforms. The update is a significant step towards improving accessibility and support for different architectures within the GitHub ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent news, as it should unblock having precompiled packages available for a number of applications for arm64—for me, most notably, OpenZFS: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14511&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a quick example I put together on how to use these runners to accelerate docker builds: https://github.com/gartnera/actions-arm64-native-example&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this is great, for people claiming they can now built multi-arch images without emulation, how are you planning on doing so? As far as I know, if you want to build multi-arch images on native runners for each platform, you basically need to:* Configure a workflow with 1 job for each arch, each building a standalone single-arch image, tagging it with a unique tag, and pushing each to your registry* Configure another job which runs at the completion of the previous jobs that creates a combined manifest containing each image using `docker manifest create`.Basically, doing the steps listed in https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-... under "The hard way with docker manifest
".Does anyone have a better approach, or some reusable workflows/GHA that make this process simpler? I know about Depot.dev which basically abstracts the runners away and handles all of this for you, but I don't see a good way to do this yourself without GitHub offering some better abstraction for building docker images.Edit: I just noticed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42729529 which has a great example of exactly these steps (and I just realized you can just push the digests, instead of tags too, which is nice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728015</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While thinking of making a game I’ve found these helpful:1. The Art of Game Design, A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell - https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design2. 20 Tips on Making Games by Jordan Mechner - https://www.jordanmechner.com/downloads/library/20tips.pdf3. Liz England’s blog - https://lizengland.com/blog/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons I got into software development was that I wanted to make some games (even just small ones that I release for free).I've now been coding for like 14 years, and I still haven't done it (besides a number of prototypes). And I'm so burnt out on writing code that I never have the mental energy to push through and get one done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think putting off polish for later as the OP and multiple comments here recommend is a fallacy. There are many popular, successful games that would just not be fun if they didn't have good animations, no effects and everything was boxes. Every game that relies on "feeling good to play". It might be fine for an RPG or an RTS, but it's probably not for something like Overwatch or Doom (the new ones). Just imagine Vampire Survivors without sound or effects. Some games live off the art style alone. This is a very controversional opinion, but I think if e.g. Ori and the Blind Forest had bad art, no one would have played the game. Some games you can evaluate really well with bad art and no juice or polish, other games need some and there are even games that need a lot of it, before you know if they can be fun. It's not that simple imho. I remember working on games that were not really fun until I added some effect and suddenly it was really addicting. People like flashing lights and noises and pretty pictures. If good, unique or interesting art was irrelevant, no one would invest in it, but people do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681545</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;A new laser technology has been developed that can measure vast distances with nanometre precision, significantly improving the accuracy of distance measurements in various fields such as space exploration, earth sciences, and engineering. This technique utilizes advanced laser systems to achieve unprecedented levels of precision, enabling scientists to gain better insights into the universe and enhance the capabilities of various technologies reliant on accurate distance measurements. The innovation demonstrates potential applications in improving the functionality of satellite navigation and mapping systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Victorian-era interferometers, commonly used for grinding telescope mirrors, could only measure distances of a few meters with precision in the hundreds of nanometers.However, laser interferometers were already quite good; LIGO, most famously, detected gravitational waves by measuring strains of around 10⁻²⁰ over a distance of 1120 km, which works out to a change in distance of less than 0.000012 nanometers, much less than the width of a proton.The news here actually seems to be that "A new way to gauge distance using lasers can measure lengths of more than 100 kilometres ... To continue reading, subscribe today with our January sale."  So, uh, I don't know, maybe the reporter wasn't familiar with LIGO and thought that nanometer-precision interferometry over kilometers was new?  Sitkack, you say there's a paper somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am only two pages in, but I want to say this paper is very well written. People should give reading it a try reading (with LLM assistance).If this technique could be adapted to existing optical fiber infrastructure, we could see the effects of fiber optic cable stretch and deformation in realtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42693239</guid></item><item><title>44.

The entire org is very, very unhappy about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’ve been hammering us pretty hard, especially some folks in the leadership chain who worked with them before. While I have no direct beef with the product, the reality is that our Enterprise workload (and in fact, most Enterprise IT workloads in my experience) are VM-first, not container-first.My research conclusion at the time was that, while OpenShift is a great product worthy of consideration, it really only shines in organizations that are heavily invested in microservices or Kubernetes. If you (or more specifically, your vendors) haven’t migrated into that state, it’s not worth it compared to a RHEL server license and their KVM+Cockpit solution for bog standard VMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What're the FLOSS technologies underlying OpenShift?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Potoo, a family of nocturnal birds found in Central and South America, known for their distinctive appearance and behavior. They have large eyes, camouflaged plumage, and a unique call, which contributes to their mysterious reputation. The Potoos are primarily insectivorous and are notable for their cryptic roosting habits, often blending in perfectly with tree branches to avoid predators. Their conservation status varies, with some species facing threats due to habitat loss. The article also highlights various aspects of their biology, ecology, and cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;

The intention was to cause the announcer to say some funny words:&gt; It was 1989 through 1993. Saratoga, NY, not Sarasota Fla. The goal was to get the track announcer to call out: "...and it's All Pink on the inside!" In fact, it took three horses over about four years. The first horse, "All Pink" ran on the inside, but never got the call. "Ol Pink" ran too close to the rail, and jumped it, ending up on the infield. Finally a mare, "Awl Pink" got the call in late '93.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a ban on TikTok, citing national security concerns related to the app's Chinese ownership. It highlights the implications of the ruling on user privacy, potential impact on social media governance, and the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China regarding technology and data security. The decision is seen as a significant move in the broader context of regulating foreign-owned tech companies operating in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is going to be an interesting experiment:
A widely used social network across the world WITHOUT american content.Until now, the closest thing we had like this were national our regional networks like Russia's vk, but Vk was never truly popular outside Russian speaking countries.Now we, for the first time ever, will have the situation where a social network has global reach but without american content.Will it keep being a english first space? Will it survive/thrive? How the content is going to evolve? What does this means in terms of global cultural influence? Will we see internationalized Chinese content dominating it? Will this backfire for the US?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone here who's not a TikTok content creator reasonably upset about losing access to the platform? Can you tell me why it will sting for you? I was really surprised that my daughters (avid teenage TikTok users) are much more relieved than mad. Both said they wasted too much time on TikTok and were hoping life will now feel better. Seems the very thing that made the platform sticky puts it in a guilty pleasure category perhaps.(I'm asking about the lived experience outside of the political questions around who should decide what we see / access online.)EDIT: Thank you for the replies! Interesting. I'm still wondering if most people use TikTok just for passive entertainment? I don't love Youtube, but it's been a huge learning and music discovery resource for me.The only thing I get sent from TikTok are dances and silly memes but I don't have an account.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the easiest answer to follow for "why is this not prevented by free speech protection" is "the fact that petitioners “cannot avoid or mitigate” the effects of the Act by altering their speech."

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing challenges in the insurance industry, highlighting how rising risks associated with climate change, economic instability, and other global crises are making it difficult for insurers to manage and price coverage. It argues that as the frequency and severity of catastrophic events grow, many risks may become uninsurable, leading to significant implications for individuals and businesses reliant on insurance for protection. The author emphasizes the need for a reevaluation of risk management practices and potential shifts in societal approaches to resilience and risk-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;American, living in area prone to natural disasters: "Is the WHOLE WORLD becoming uninsurable?"The answer is obviously "no" since there are other parts of the world that don't live on a hurricane highway nor build houses made from firewood in an area prone to wildfires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not uninsurable, but buildings are going to have to become tougher.It's happened before. Chicago's reaction to the Great Fire was simple - no more building wooden houses. Chicago went all brick. Still is, mostly.The trouble is, brick isn't earthquake resistant. Not without steel reinforcement.I live in a house built of cinder block filled with concrete reinforced with steel. A commercial builder built this as his personal residence in 1950. The walls look like a commercial building. The outside is just painted cinder block. Works fine, survived the 1989 earthquake without damage, low maintenance. It's not what most people want today in the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like we see in California, when the government sets a price ceiling, insurance companies just leave.  Same in Florida.  If the free market truly was allowed run normally, the insurance rates in Pacific Palisades or on the Florida coast would be so high that no one could afford to live there.  Is that a bad thing?  If someone was living in a house near where they tested missiles, we'd call them crazy.  At what point can we say the same about people building and rebuilding over and over in these disaster areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732728</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL Anonymizer is a tool designed to facilitate data anonymization for PostgreSQL databases. It aims to help organizations comply with data protection regulations by providing methods to transform sensitive data into a format that preserves its usability for testing and analysis while protecting individual privacy. The documentation covers installation procedures, usage instructions, and configuration options, along with examples and guidelines for customizing the anonymization process to suit specific needs. It emphasizes ease of use and flexibility in handling various data types and structures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clickhouse has something similar called clickhouse-obfuscator [1]. It even works offline with data dumps so you can quickly prepare and send somewhat realistic example data to others.According to its --help output, it is designed to retain the following properties of data:- cardinalities of values (number of distinct values) for every column and for every tuple of columns;- conditional cardinalities: number of distinct values of one column under condition on value of another column;- probability distributions of absolute value of integers; sign of signed integers; exponent and sign for floats;- probability distributions of length of strings;- probability of zero values of numbers; empty strings and arrays, NULLs;- data compression ratio when compressed with LZ77 and entropy family of codecs;- continuity (magnitude of difference) of time values across table; continuity of floating point values.- date component of DateTime values;- UTF-8 validity of string values;- string values continue to look somewhat natural[1]: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhou...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have some experience with the 'Masking Views' functionality. If you are going to rely on it and specifically in a Rails app, know that it is against conventions and thus is generally inconvenient. This may be the same with any other framework that features DB schema migrations.More specifically the integration of this functionality at a fortunately ex-employer was purposefully kept away from the dev team (no motivation was offered, however I suspect that some sort of segmentation was sought after) and thus did not take into account that tables with PII did in fact still need their schema changed from time to time.This lead to the anonymizer extension, together with the confidential views to only be installed on production DB instances with dev, test, and staging instances running vanilla postgres. With this, the possibility to catch DB migration issues related to the confidential views was pushed out to the release itself. This lead to numerous failed releases which involved having the ops team intervene, manually remove the views for the duration of the release, then manually re-create them.So,If you plan to use this extension, and specifically its views, make sure you have it set up in the exactly same way on all environments. Also make sure that its initialisation and view creation are part of your framework's DB migrations so that they are documented and easy to precisely reproduce on new environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the best ways to handle this sort of thing is to put things like PII in a separate database entirely and replace it with a token in the "main" database.  When something like PII actually needs to be retrieved you first retrieve the token and then search the other database for said token to get the real data.It certainly complicates things but it provides an additional security layer of separation between the PII and it's related data.  You can provide your end users access to a database without having to worry about them getting access to the "dangerous" data.  If they do indeed need access to the data pointed to via the token they can request access to that related database.This method also provides more performance since you don't need to encrypt the entire database (which is often required when storing PII) and also don't need to add extra security context function calls to every database request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694732</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconception that the Canon 6299 camera can be used as a webcam without additional equipment or software. It explains that while some cameras can work for this purpose with appropriate tools, the Canon 6299 does not support direct USB webcam functionality. The author emphasizes the importance of using specific capture cards or streaming software to enable this capability and provides alternative solutions for users looking to livestream or video chat using DSLR technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also discovered that I couldn't use my Canon SLR to record more than 30 minutes of video continuously.The problem however wasn't Canon, but that I lived in a region (EU) that would have imposed a customs tariff on cameras that could do that, but by keeping it under that, the camera would be classed as a 'stills' camera and so was therefore exempt.Admittedly this is different from the case in the article - but it would appear that owning something that could physically do what you want it to is only half the battle for numerous reasons, and in this case it would have been my government demanding extra money to 'unlock' this functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's reminds me when I was in South East Asia a few years back and wanted to do some time lapse or series photography with my Sony Alpha a7ii. A camera that I had paid close to 2k€ for (just body, no glass).It required an app to be installed on the camera that was paid-for. Which in term required the camera to be connected to a WiFi.Imagine discovering this while on a trip in the jungle or the desert or whatever ...It was a one time purchase (I think around 10€) but it was still a complete wtf.You had to purchase the app through the camera's app store. You read right.Ofc this failed as my CC was declined because I live in Germany and the transaction got marked as suspicious, coming from SEA.So I had to go to town and hunt down a wifi USB dongle so I could turn my laptop into a WiFi hotspot for the camera, while using the VPN masking the built-in WiFi to be connected to a German IP.You had to enter the CC details through the camera's on-screen keyboard that was operated with the joystick on the camera's body. It took me a good ten minutes.No words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The penny-fucking behaviour of huge organization in parallel of pushing at you unwanted (actually obstructing) messages in various ways, email, pop-ups and tootip suggestions and advices, CI/CD pushed on the user on a prominent way are repelling. In parallel to the rubbish web presence not working reliably or at all, far from being easy for clients but usually having bells and whistles for distraction. I saved quite a bit of money thinking twice if I want to be abused by products made for the benefit of the organization mainly. Sometimes with side benefits for the user, but that is more like coincidence, side effect of addressing the organization's needs. Less and less point buying consumer products if it just makes your life similarly difficult, not better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42735393</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long before UKI was a thing, this kind of attack was prevented by hardcoding into an EFI stub kernel the sha512 hash of a trusted initrd that would verify the cryptographic authenticity of the initrd that did the "heavy lifting" (mounting disks etc).We have had not just secure boot but had it better on Linux (and other Unix-like) systems for a very long time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my system, I used `tpm2-measure-pcr=yes` in `/etc/crypttab.initramfs`, then used `--tpm2-pcrs=0+2+7+15:sha256=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with `systemd-cryptenroll`.As soon as a volume is decrypted, initrd will write `volume-key` to PCR 15, so any further executables can no longer access the data stored in the TPM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I first read about TPM-based FDE on Linux[0], I was excited that the systemd guys were finally taking a step in the right direction - BitLocker/FileVault were standard on Windows/macOS for a long time by that point. FDE should be secure by default, dead-simple to set up (e.g. a checkbox in the installer that defaults to "enabled"), and painless for everyday use.[0]: https://0pointer.de/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.htmlThen I read about the implementation details[0], and it's a complex bloody mess with an unending chain of brittle steps and edge cases, that are begging for a mistake and get exploited. So here we are.I'm convinced that "measure the kernel" into "measure the initrd" into "show login screen" is all it should take.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42733640</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an fun read, as someone who's both a Korean BW player and a speech recognition researcher.It's interesting to note that the original Korean transcription already has many errors, seemingly (and impressively) corrected by LLMs later on. For example, 12 안마당 빌드 (12 courtyard build) is actually 12 앞마당 빌드 (12 frontyard build), which might have been more understandable to BW players. Similarly 투에처리 빌드 (processing-at-two build? makes no sense lol) should have been transcribed 투해처리 빌드 (two-Hatchery build).Therefore it may also be helpful to directly feed the slang dictionary into Whisper's inference process using contextual biasing. There are lots of ways to do this, but the simplest would be to increase the probability of slang words in the dictionary in the final prediction layer of Whisper by a constant factor. This is fairly easy to implement, for example by using HuggingFace's library: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/internal/generat...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t let the title fool you: this is anextremely thorough and creative take on translating and making more approachable the commentary of StarCraft.As the author rightly points out, in its 27 years of existence, commentary around the game has become a domain specific language. Not just Korean or English.This approach of automated scripting and using AI to understand roughly what was said and then make it coherent is really cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LOL, as a non-native English speaker, reading this reminds me of EXACTLY the same problem of translating many things, but more precisely, computer articles and software development.There’s a huge amount of terms that are difficult to translate (sharding? Hash?). The only real solution is to adopt them to your language, more or less adapted, which is what happens over time. But it requires a community that, to some degree, is able to cross the gap between the languages. In this case, learning English.Talking about software development in Spanish (my native language) is a succession of imported terms from English.I don’t think there’s a good way of doing that, and I’m interested to see how automatic translations deal with it, because the only way this can work is with a process of mixing both language in a social way and see what terms evolve from that process.And you need, in the terms the post describes, people that know Korean at least in a non-fluent way. And the game itself, of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42740596</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi all, I'm Dominic and I'm on the product team at Mermaid. I enjoyed reading a lot of your feedback!It seems there's several good ideas and thoughts on the direction of the platform that we'd love to learn more about. If you have problems with the current product, improvement requests, or would like to chat then let's connect! Please email me at dominic@mermaidchart.com or book time on my calendar: (https://calendly.com/dominic-01w/mermaid-shapers-product-int...)Thanks for taking a look at our latest release!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent some time playing around with this recently and loved it at first. I also realized ChatGPT is pretty good at generating Mermaid diagrams (didn't try your own AI features).However after getting into it some I ran into some significant frustrations. After creating a medium-complexity diagram, I was excited to see the Whiteboard feature to drag things around / improve the layout manually. But it really started breaking, it just wouldn't let me organize/drag things where I wanted, and I couldn't get things to not overlap. I also wished more diagram types supported Whiteboard (I noticed some didn't).Also I some confusion between the capabilities of mermaidchart.com and mermaid.live. Are these competitors? Variations of similar apps. I was confused. Also "Playground" vs "Live Editor" is confusing.Overall glad this exists and hope it continues to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only use diagramming tools with automatic layout algos to generate visualizations programmatically to debug things. For documentation purpose, I largely prefer to draw them by hand using OmniGraffle, because making graphs look nice using tools like graphviz is very complex and you find yourself abusing features to hack your vision into realityWhat's dearly needed in my opinion is a graph layout algo based on a machine learning model (so that it can take into account readability and aesthetics). Unfortunately what I found so far is mostly concerned with displaying large graphs, which is kind of another domain altogether.I hope Mermaid is collecting every single edition point that happens on their UI, that would make for a nice dataset I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738656</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" presents research on how large language models, such as GPT-3, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities without the need for task-specific training. The study explores their performance on various reasoning benchmarks, showing that these models can effectively generate correct responses to novel tasks by leveraging their extensive training on vast text datasets. The authors analyze the models' zero-shot reasoning abilities, highlighting the implications for artificial intelligence and the potential for future developments in understanding and improving reasoning in language models.&lt;/p&gt;

I like the idea of a meta-mechanism that learns to update an associative memory based on how surprising the data is. The other stuff, reading memory via keys and values and selectively erasing it with gating, look pretty conventional on a first glance. Thank you for sharing this on HN. I've added it to my reading list.EDIT: I'm reminded of this other type of associative memory: https://github.com/glassroom/heinsen_routing. The idea there is to compute a mixture of memories that best predicts the given input sequence. Quite frankly, I don't remember how the whole thing works, but I do remember that it works. It's been a while since I used it, so YMMV. In any case, it may be of interest to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688392</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;A professor at UC Santa Cruz, Gary Rendsburg, has made a significant archaeological discovery by unearthing what is believed to be the oldest alphabet known to date, dating back to around 1800 to 1500 BCE. This finding, derived from inscriptions in ancient Semitic script, provides crucial insights into the development of written language and its evolution. Rendsburg's research highlights the connection between the ancient alphabet and the origins of Hebrew and Arabic scripts, underscoring the importance of this discovery in understanding the historical context of language development.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember having very different emotional responses to faculty members as a student. Schwartz struck me as elegant, diffident, blue-blooded, and completely disinterested in teaching a bunch of young morons who were just taking the course as a distribution requirement. I'm glad to see that he and his former students are an influential force in this area of study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope we will get much more research like this, now when Syria is liberated and has Democratic governors!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42689054</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on end-to-end encryption. It explores how advancements in AI technologies can intersect with encryption practices, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and privacy concerns that may arise. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong encryption in the face of evolving AI capabilities, suggesting that while AI can enhance security measures, it can also pose threats if used maliciously. The piece advocates for a balanced approach to integrating AI with cryptographic systems to safeguard user privacy and data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You might even convince yourself that these questions are “privacy preserving,” since no human police officer would ever rummage through your papers, and law enforcement would only learn the answer if you were (probably) doing something illegal.Something I've started to see happen but never mentioned is the effect automated detection has on systems: As detection becomes more automated (previously authored algorithms, now with large AI models), there's less cash available for individual case workers, and more trust at the managerial level on automatic detection. This leads to false positives turning into major frustrations since it's hard to get in touch with a person to resolve the issue. When dealing with businesses it's frustrating, but as these get more used in law enforcement, this could be life ruining.For instance - I got flagged as illegal reviews on Amazon years ago and spent months trying to make my case to a human. Every year or so I try to raise the issue again to leave reviews, but it gets nowhere. Imagine this happening for a serious criminal issue, with the years long back log on some courts, this could ruin someones life.More automatic detection can work (and honestly, it's inevitable) but it's got to acknowledge that false positives will happen and allocate enough people to resolve those issues. As it stands right now, these detection systems get built and immediately human case workers get laid off, there's this assumption that detection systems REPLACE humans, but it should be that they augment and focus human case workers so you can do more with less - the human aspect needs to be included in the budgeting.But the incentives aren't there, and the people making the decisions aren't the ones working the actual cases so they aren't confronted with the problem. For them, the question is why save $1m when you could save $2m? With large AI models making it easier and more effective to build automated detection I expect this problem to get significantly worse over the next years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Yet this approach is obviously much better than what’s being done at companies like OpenAI, where the data is processed by servers that employees (presumably) can log into and access.No need for presumption here: OpenAI is quite transparent about the fact that they retain data for 30 days and have employees and third-party contractors look at it.https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data&gt; To help identify abuse, API data may be retained for up to 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law).https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/&gt; Our access to API business data stored on our systems is limited to (1) authorized employees that require access for engineering support, investigating potential platform abuse, and legal compliance and (2) specialized third-party contractors who are bound by confidentiality and security obligations, solely to review for abuse and misuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We are about to face many hard questions about these systems, including some difficult questions about whether they will actually be working for us at all.And how. I'd lean towards no. Where we're headed feels like XKEYSCORE on steroids. I'd love to take the positive, optimistic bent on this, but when you look at where we've been combined with the behavior of the people in charge of these systems (to be clear, not the researchers or engineers, but c-suite), hope of a neutral, privacy-first future seems limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734478</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "standards-first" web framework that prioritizes adherence to web standards over proprietary solutions. It emphasizes the importance of building applications that are accessible, maintainable, and perform well across different browsers and devices. The framework encourages developers to utilize native web technologies and practices to enhance compatibility and longevity of their projects. By adopting a standards-first approach, the article argues that developers can create more robust and user-friendly web applications that align with the evolving web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is interesting, but I really dislike the way it tries to bash every other tech in the blog post, on the homepage and in the docs itself. The tone is very confident, but it will put you open to a lot of scrutiny.Instead it could really use a lot more explanation on how it works. If you make comparisons make sure they are fair. The image "JavaScript mixed together" and "Strict separation of concerns" is just comparing apples with oranges. Multiple times in the docs it compares a huge complicated JSX like component and replaces it with 3 lines of html and 3 lines of css. I don't believe that it does the same thing.Some of the claims are strange. It praises standard HTML but apparently you have to use some custom Markdown syntax to write it. How does that add up? And on top of that it also introduces new syntax for loops and variables.This could all work perfectly fine. But my suggestion would be to talk more about how it works and what are the advantages and less trying to bring down competitors. It could use less grand claims and focus more on what it really does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I help maintain Lit[1], which I consider a very standards-first non-framework.With Lit you can build full apps with standard and plain JS, CSS, and HTML; standard web components; and no build tools.I don't immediately see how this is any more standards-first, especially when it mentions Markdown, tooling, and a CLI. I don't actually really see what exactly this even is from this landing page. It would help to show something up front.[1]: https://lit.dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I just getting more grumpy in my old age or is every new framework just complete bloat ?I wanted to give it a try, but I need to install bun, a new js runtime, okay fine, why not. Javascript needs more runtimes after all.Then I need to install `nuekit`.. globally.. Okay...Now I need to run an obscure command 'nue; which I didn't know I installed.
`nue create simple-blog`Then it tells me to follow the tutorial docs, great. But I need to start writing YAML.. Losing patience now.My relief comes when I see :&gt; Nue is not currently tested or developed under Windows, so use it at your own risk.Well I guess as a Windows user I can't have a 'Standards First Web Framework'.Think I'll stick to what actually works instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42722855</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex relationship between French Modernist artists and the mass media that emerged in their time. It examines how figures like Marcel Duchamp and André Breton both critiqued and utilized the technologies of mass communication, reflecting a dual sentiment of disdain and fascination. The piece highlights the tension between their avant-garde aspirations and the commercial realities of media culture, showcasing how these artists navigated the rapidly changing landscape of their era while grappling with the impact of mass media on art and society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In the 1860s, Charles Baudelaire bemoaned what we might now call doomscrolling:
[...]
The poet’s revulsion was widely shared in 19th-century France. Amid rapid increases in circulation, newspapers were depicted as a virus or narcotic responsible for collective neurosis, overexcitement and lowered productivity.On one hand, one could think "oh, the current social network bashing is just the same doom and gloom reaction to more communication, it will pass".On the other hand, if you know well the period, the newspapers of the time - which were closer to the tabloids of today, but worse - did a lot to stir hatred of foreigners, of Jews, of Poor, and contributed massively in causing wars, colonialism and pogroms.Emile Zola published "J'accuse !" in a newspaper, but it was newspapers who stirred rabid antisemitism everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The internet and its associated gadgets stir reactions remarkably like those once directed at the press. In some quarters, futurist technophilia; more commonly, alarm at the social, political and cultural impact of these innovations, combined with neurotic dependence upon them.Note that the article is not taking the simplistic position that, because 19th century French writers decried the emergence of the newspaper, and 21st century contemporary thinkers decry the dominance of social media, that the latter should be dismissed. It's more nuanced than that, and it's really mostly an accounting of how those Modernists thought about newspapers, with a little bit of "let's consider a modern example..." at the end.One thing I'd like to point out, though, is that very common argument by which one waves away concerns about social media today because, in the past, Socrates said reading is bad, and Mallarmé said newspapers are bad, is really a canard for two reasons.First, because the social media is not reading, or newspapers, it's a different thing altogether, and in any case what happened in the past does not strictly determine a new case in the present or the future.Second, because I'm fairly certain Mallarmé and Proust and Baudelaire would probably look at the world newspapers created, and say "I was right about newspapers all along". It did create yellow journalism, it did create tabloids, it did redefine truth, and recalibrate leisure, and it did create doomscrolling, and make people think in different—and not necessarily better—ways. Technology changes the world, and people adapt to it. After the fact of that change, the world normalizes, and new generations can't conceive of any prior alternative way of being. But, that does not mean the change was an improvement.As a consequence, it may be categorically incorrect for us to even try to evaluate these historical positions from our modern perch. Maybe all we can do is listen to what people living through that change said, and take it as read, pun intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They weren’t wrong, the people controlling the media, whether that be the owner of the newscompany or the owner of the algorithm that influences what newscompany gets recommended prefers it when the reader gets recommended criticism of others based on race or other indignificant things instead of riches, cause they are the people with riches.It’s not a coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42739572</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article on dark patterns in games discusses manipulative design techniques used by game developers to influence player behavior, often leading to undesirable outcomes like unintentional purchases or excessive playtime. It explores various types of dark patterns, provides examples from different games, and emphasizes the ethical considerations and negative impact these practices can have on players. The goal is to raise awareness about these tactics and encourage a more transparent and fair gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool idea, pretty good execution, but your UI is confusing.1. There's so much happening on the screen between your app's UI and the fake UI with the dark patterns that it's confusing. IMO you should show the objective first, and then let the user click to reveal the fake UI and challenge. For example, simply show, "Challenge #1 — Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription." Then have a button that says, "Start Challenge." When that button is clicked, then reveal the UI.2. Give me some context. If you just say, "Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription," that's not really enough. You should set the scenario. "Imagine you're subscribed to an app, but you don't want to be subscribed anymore. So you sign into the app and click the cancel button. It loads a new screen. How do proceed from here to finalize your cancelation?"3. Don't tell me the answer in advance. Naming the first challenge "Color Confusion" tells me the answer.4. Don't auto-advance steps. I had no idea that I auto advanced. I changed tabs, then came back, then was scrolling down looking for the next step button. Just let me manually click to the next step as a user. Preferably at the bottom, near the pattern explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a nice game but I have some feedback:The first two levels want you to click the non-misleading option and then the third requires you to click the misleading option, which then has a "Report as Deceptive Marketing" button. This feels counterproductive if you're trying to teach people to not fall for dark patterns, you've just rewarded them for falling for it and punished anyone who didn't!. Then, a later level has the opposite, you see (almost) the same dialog from level 3, but you need to click the other option.The instructions for Level 3 do say you're supposed to "find the hidden truth", but that's not necessarily what clicking the "Activate Premium Features" button would do in real life. I think it would work better if it stuck to one side of things, probably having players always try to avoid getting misled. At the end it says one of the outcomes should be "Improved muscle memory", so the goal should probably be no clicking on bad things.This also makes it confusing what it's supposed to be simulating to me. I've never had a site offer to let me report their own promotions as deceptive (or as a later level has, "Report Bait and Switch Tactic" when you go to check out).The "Trick Questions" level had only pre-checked checkboxes that you should uncheck (and the button tells you to uncheck all of them, there's no thought required here), I think it would work better if some needed to remain checked. It ties in to the same "muscle memory" issue, unchecking isn't guaranteed to be a good action. Similarly, it might make sense to have Basket Sneaking include a coupon code or something that you shouldn't remove from your cart, so players learn to read closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  I wish to opt out of receiving exclusive promotional offers and updates about products I might be interested in.

  What this means:
  When checked: They will send you marketing emails. Uncheck to stop promotional emails.

  How it tricks you:
  They use 'opt out' and 'wish' to create a double negative - saying no to opting out means saying yes to emails

Fun stuff! But I'm really unclear about this particular checkbox on lesson 9 - in my eyes, wishing is not a negative - so this is a single negative, and you would check it to not receive updates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737778</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article investigates a malicious RJ45 dongle designed to compromise network security. It details the author's examination of the device, revealing its capabilities to intercept and manipulate network traffic. The investigation uncovers how the dongle can exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, making it a serious threat to device integrity and data privacy. The author emphasizes the importance of being cautious with hardware, particularly unverified devices, and raises awareness about potential security risks in everyday technology usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The English-language product brief implies that “SR” stands for “Supereal”; that brand name comes up in the context of counterfeit FTDI FT232RL chips that plagued the industry some time ago.This wording is misleading because it implies the fake chips were the plague. The fake chips worked fine, and it was FTDI's official driver that intentionally ruined peoples' working hardware when they detected the fakes and changed their PID to 0000 so they would no longer be recognized: http://www.rei-labs.net/changing-ftdi-pid/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If you want to try it, be aware that it requires Intel Pentium 166MHz or above."Made me laugh. Fun article, also really love the genre of "bored smart person goes too deep on something that the end result is obvious by common sense but proving it requires surprising amount of ingenuity and scrappiness"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across the tweet about this "Evil" dongle and instantly recognized it as the exact same thing I worked on before... It's not evil, it's just annoying.https://blog.brixit.nl/making-a-usb-ethernet-adapter-work-sr...In my case I disabled the SPI flash module to have it not appear as a CD drive, the author of this post actually found some documentation about the SPI being optional. Funnily enough this post now also gives you all the tooling to make an actual evil RJ45 dongle by reflashing one :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743033</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the initial steps and considerations involved in building a data center, highlighting key factors such as site selection, space requirements, and infrastructure planning. It emphasizes the importance of scalability, energy efficiency, and redundancy in design to ensure reliable operations. Additionally, the piece discusses the technological and environmental factors that must be taken into account to support the center's long-term viability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would you call colocation "building your own data center"? You could call it "colocation" or "renting space in a data center". What are you building? You're racking. Can you say what you mean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the old Rackspace days! Boy we had some war stories:   - Some EMC guys came to install a storage device for us to test... and tripped over each other and knocked out an entire Rack of servers like a comedy skit. (They uh... didn't win the contract.)
   - Some poor guy driving a truck had a heart attack and the crash took our DFW datecenter offline. (There were ballards to prevent this sort of scenario, but the cement hadn't been poured in them yet.)
   - At one point we temporarily laser-beamed bandwidth across the street to another building
   - There was one day we knocked out windows and purchased box fans because servers were literally catching on fire.

Data center science has... well improved since the earlier days. We worked with Facebook on the OpenCompute Project that had some very forward looking infra concepts at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess there's another in-between step buying your own hardware, even when merely "leasing individual racks", and EC2 instances: dedicated bare metal providers like Hetzner.This lets one get closer to the metal (e.g. all your data is on your specific disk, rather than an abstracted block storage, such as EBS, not shared with other users, cheaper, etc) without having to worry about the staff that installs the hardware or where/how it fits in a rack.For us, this was a way to get 6x performance for 1/6 of the cost. (Excluding, of course our time, but we enjoyed it!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743019</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Doubleclickjacking: What Is It and How to Protect Yourself" explains the concept of doubleclickjacking, a method used by malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in browser settings and ad networks to display unauthorized advertisements on websites. It outlines how attackers can manipulate legitimate ad services, causing users to inadvertently click on ads that lead to phishing sites or malware. The article also provides guidance on how individuals and website owners can protect themselves from such attacks, including using ad blockers, ensuring up-to-date software, and maintaining awareness of online security practices.&lt;/p&gt;

The demo UI of "Double click here" isn't very convincing - I bet there's a version of this that gets people to double click consistently though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea here is simple: get users to commit to clicking twice, but the pop up page only accepts a single click before closing. Their second click goes to the page underneath the pop up, which is e.g. an authentication button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42693748</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of graphics in NetBSD without relying on the X11 system. It reviews alternative graphical frameworks, highlighting the potential for using graphics libraries that enable more direct access to hardware and improved performance. The author shares insights on the benefits of this approach, including simplicity and reduced resource consumption, while also covering practical use cases and examples of applications that run effectively under this setup. The piece emphasizes the growing trend towards lightweight, more efficient graphical solutions in modern operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These interfaces can be cute to play with, but there's a reason that fbdev is deprecated on Linux - it's not a good interface outside toy examples. wscons may be more powerful, but I don't think it can be used to fully enable modern accelerated display devices, although do correct me if I'm wrong.Despite some confusion in terminology, modern interfaces also operate on frame buffers, but with an API for switching them out atomically. Likewise, your display server (at least modern ones) just take your client window as a completed frame buffer, and mainly serve to let multiple applications all show their frame buffers without having to worry about what other applications are doing. Frame buffers all the way down, just with support for DMA, atomicity, fancy formats and color spaces, etc.You can use the appropriate modern APIs to make a single, exclusive graphical application with all the benefits of modern display hardware easily enough. That is, after all, what your display server is. You just don't gain much - just a little bit of saved sideband IPC.X11 makes it seem like a display server is a complicated thing that has to support drawing and what not, but with alternatives like Wayland, a full screen client buffer is handed off zero-copy from the client application tot he hardware without being looked at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a parallel note, this brought memories of SVGALib.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVGALib&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for encoding UTF-8 strings that avoids the overhead of branching operations, which can improve performance in certain applications. It explains the challenges and inefficiencies associated with traditional UTF-8 encoding due to conditional statements and presents a branchless approach using bit manipulation and mathematical operations. The author provides a detailed breakdown of the encoding process, accompanied by code examples, to demonstrate how this method can be implemented effectively while maintaining compatibility with standard UTF-8. Overall, the piece emphasizes the benefits of optimizing UTF-8 encoding for high-performance scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742184"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incidentally, this automatic branch-if-zero from LLVM is being improved.First of all, a recent LLVM patch apparently changes codegen to use CMOV instead of a branch:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/102885Beyond that, Intel recently updated their manual to retroactively define the behavior of BSR/BSF on zero inputs: it leaves the destination register unmodified.  This matches the AMD manual, and I suspect it matches the behavior of all existing x86-64 processors (but that will need to be tested, I guess).If so, you don't need either a branch or CMOV.  Just set a register to 32, then run BSR with the same register as destination.  If the BSR input is nonzero, the 32 is overwritten with the trailing-zero count.  If the BSR input is zero, then BSR leaves the register unmodified and you get 32.Since this behavior is now guaranteed for future x86-64 processors, and assuming it's indeed compatible with all existing x86-64 processors (maybe even all x86 processors period?), LLVM will no longer need the old path regardless of what it's targeting.Note that if you're targeting a newer x86-64 version, LLVM will just emit TZCNT, which just does what you'd expect and returns 32 if the input is zero (or 64 for a 64-bit TZCNT).  But as the blog post demonstrates, many people still build for baseline x86_64.(Intel does document one discrepancy between processors: "On some older processors, use of a 32-bit operand size may clear the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit destination while leaving the lower 32 bits unmodified.")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have access to the BMI2 instruction set I can do branchless UTF-8 encoding like in the article using only 9 instructions and 73 bytes of lookup tables:    branchless_utf8:
        mov     rax, rdi
        lzcnt   ecx, esi
        lea     rdx, [rip + .L__unnamed_1]
        movzx   ecx, byte ptr [rcx + rdx]
        lea     rdx, [rip + example::DEP_AND_OR::h78cbe1dc7fe823a9]
        pdep    esi, esi, dword ptr [rdx + 8*rcx]
        or      esi, dword ptr [rdx + 8*rcx + 4]
        movbe   dword ptr [rdi], esi
        mov     qword ptr [rdi + 8], rcx
        ret


The code:    static DEP_AND_OR: [(u32, u32); 5] = [
        (0, 0),
        (0b01111111_00000000_00000000_00000000, 0b00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000),

    ];

    const LEN: [u8; 33] = [
        // 0-10 leading zeros: not valid.
        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

        // 21-24 leading zeros: 2 bytes.
        2, 2, 2, 2,
        // 25-32 leading zeros: 1 byte.
        1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
    ];

    pub unsafe fn branchless_utf8(codepoint: u32) -&gt; ([u8; 4], usize) {
        let leading_zeros = codepoint.leading_zeros() as usize;
        let bytes = LEN[leading_zeros] as usize;
        let (mask, or) = *DEP_AND_OR.get_unchecked(bytes);
        let ret = core::arch::x86_64::_pdep_u32(codepoint, mask) | or;
        (ret.swap_bytes().to_le_bytes(), bytes)
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  /// Encode a UTF-8 codepoint.
  /// […]
  /// Returns a length of zero for invalid codepoints (surrogates and out-of-bounds values);
  /// it's up to the caller to turn that into U+FFFD, or return an error.

It's not a "UTF-8 codepoint", that's horridly mangling the terminology. Code points are just code points.The input to a UTF-8 encode is a scalar value, not a code point, and encoding a scalar value is infallible. What doubly kills me is that Rust has a dedicated type for scalar values. (`char`.)(In languages with non-[USV]-strings…, Python raises an exception, JS emits garbage.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742184</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations and challenges associated with the CIELAB color space, specifically in terms of its representation of perceptual brightness. It highlights that while CIELAB aims to create a uniform color space based on human vision, it does not account for variations in brightness perception effectively across different colors. The author examines several issues, including the non-linear response of the human eye to brightness and how this can lead to inaccuracies when using CIELAB for color manipulation in design and imaging applications. The discussion emphasizes the need for improved models that better align with human perception to aid in color representation and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always found these "perceptual vs absolute" things about human senses very interesting.Hearing has a few quirks too:- When we measure sound pressure, we measure it in log (so, every 3dB is a doubling in sound pressure), but our hearing perceives this as a linear scale. If you make a linear volume slide, the upper part will seem as if it barely does anything.- The lower the volume, the less perceivable upper and lower ranges are compared to the midrange. This is what "loudness" intends to fix, although poor implementations have made many people assume it is a V-curve button. A proper loudness implementation will lessen its impact as volume increases, completely petering off somewhere around 33% of maximum volume.- For the most "natural" perceived sound, you don't try to get as flat a frequency response as possible but instead aim for a Harman curve.- Bass frequencies (&lt;110Hz, depending on who you ask) are omnidirectional, which means we cannot accurately perceive which direction the sound is coming from. Subwoofers exploit this fact, making it seem as if deep rich bass is coming from your puny soundbar and not the sub hidden behind the couch :).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is part of "tone mapping"[1] in high dynamic range rendering. The idea is that pixels are computed with a much larger range of values than screens can display. 16 bits per color per pixel, or even a floating point value. Then, to generate the displayed image, there's a final step where the pixel values are run through a perceptual transformation to map them into 8 bit RGB (or more, if the hardware is is available.)This has issues. When you go from a dark space to a bright space, the eye's iris stops down. But not instantaneously. It takes a second or two. This can be simulated. Cyberpunk 2077 does this. Go from a dark place in the game to bright sunlight and, for a moment, the screen becomes blinding, then adjusts.In the other direction, go into a dark space, and it's dark at first, then seems to lighten up after a while. Dark adaptation is slower then light adaptation.Tone mapping is not just an intensity adjustment. It has to compensate for the color space intensity problems the OP mentions. Human eyes are not equally sensitive to the primary colors.Some visually impaired people hate this kind of adjustment, it turns out.Here's a clip from Cyberpunk 2077.[2] Watch what happens to screen brightness as the car goes into the tunnel and then emerges into daylight.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping[2] https://youtu.be/aWlX793ACUY?t=145&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See Oklab colorspace for an attempt at fairer perceptual brightness: https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734851</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Trust No Client" discusses the importance of implementing security measures in software architecture, emphasizing that developers should not blindly trust client data inputs. It highlights various strategies to mitigate risks, such as input validation, using secure coding practices, and remaining vigilant against manipulation or exploitation. The piece advocates for a proactive approach to security, stressing the need to treat all client information as potentially unsafe and to adopt rigorous testing and monitoring procedures to safeguard applications against vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm about 90% sure that for some inane reason, McDonalds outsources and creates separate apps for each country/region with these disastrous security flaws, except that at HQ they universally demand horrifically counter-productive "anti-root" measures for every locale, to a larger extent than even finance apps.Why am I so sure about this? I live on the other side of the world, the app is almost certainly an entirely separate codebase from the Polish one the article is about, and yet here too it has the worst anti-root measures of any app by any remotely large company, including finance, healthcare and government apps. Enormous numbers of false positives. Even for those with the most mainstream Android models around.This will all just come down to one person at McD's HQ who is forcing through these ridiculous ideas and costing their company a bunch of money in the process. No other multinational employs this strategy to any similar degree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an app tries to detect that I have root or a non-stock OS, I will give it a 1-star review on Google Play 100% of the time. Everyone who has a rooted device should do this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [the extensive anti-reverse engineering measures are] more annoying than any financial app I've had, and I have 5 of them on my phoneAh, this reminds me of the Tuya app.I've done some ssl unpinning and mitm to see requests going in and out of my phone, it's pretty fun and there's often really nice and easy to use restful APIs underneath. Among them I've also done a couple of banking apps and they weren't particularly defensive either. That's great; as a user I'm empowered by it and like TFA says, it's totally fine from a security standpoint if you just don't trust the client to do anything they shouldn't be able to do. It shouldn't be your form validation that stops me from transferring a trillion dollars, and though I haven't tried, I'm sure that's not the case for those apps. All it does is allow me to get my monthly statements with a for loop rather than waiting for a laggy UI and clicking through each month.Now, Tuya is a Chinese company offering a bunch of cheap IoT devices like smart power switches and IR motion detectors. You can interact with everything through their app. That app for some reason has spent by far the most resources on anti-RE of any apps I've seen. I already bought your hardware, mate. Please let me use it on my local network. My smart home infrared motion sensors were meant to turn lights on when I enter a room. But they don't feel very smart when I'm standing in the dark for 4 seconds while they check with a server in China. I don't even need a clean API; just let me see what you do, and I'll do something similar, no support or documentation necessary. But they go through extensive measures to prevent you from interacting with the hardware you bought and which is sitting in your home.This was a while ago, but I think for the motion sensing in particular, I managed to just put them in a subnetwork with blocked internet access, and snooped on the network to catch their DHCP requests when they tried to call home. This would happen every once in a while presumably for settings/update checks, but crucially also when there was motion detected, and I didn't mind a few false positives. So in the end they were very quick, locally functioning, privacy-friendly little devices!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734956</guid></item><item><title>25.

I don't think so?Wordle - NYT daily word game. https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.htmlWaffle - some other game. https://wafflegame.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just found the following version of the Waffle game: 
https://wordle-nyt.org/waffleThe host name includes “nyt”, but the web page doesn’t seem to be owned by the New York Times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting! I think there is a lot of math going on in these kind of games. I have noticed interesting patterns in my game https://videopuzzle.org/ as well.In daily mode, everyone gets a video scrambled into 4x4 pieces, in the same way, and needs to unscramble it. The operations available to unscramble a video are swapping a tile, and shifting the entire board. The lowest score every day is usually 12-14, but sometimes much lower.Before I introduced the shifting function, surprisingly, every puzzle could only be solved in an either even or odd number of moves. Some days, all solutions would be 12-14-16 etc, while other days only 13-15-17 were possible. The arrows have changed this, as you can sometimes shave another move off if you use it smartly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742057</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing debate over drug prices in the U.S., highlighting President Biden's efforts to implement policies aimed at reducing costs for Medicare recipients. It contrasts his administration's approach with that of former President Trump, who focused on transparency and negotiations without directly capping prices. The piece outlines the implications of proposed measures on pharmaceutical companies, the potential impact on patients, and the broader political landscape as drug pricing remains a contentious topic in American healthcare reform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My ACA insurance (because I was unemployed) covered Rybelsus (pill form, which is a much higher dose due to lack of absorption through the stomach), then in like October or November they said "nah" and said "go to Ozempic" I had just completed my first two sets of increases before the final uppage to be on the stable dose, when insurance said "Nah." So my doc RX'd Trulicity to see if they would cover that, which, for some reason they also didn't.  I haven't had the time or energy during the holidays to deal with it, so now I'm dealing with increased hunger from going cold turkey off these things all because of bullshit micromanagement from shitty insurance companies on the market place.If this makes it better and easier for companies to actually pay out for this I am 100% for it, there should not be a constant jerking about for what is or isn't paid.  Also - this wasn't for weightloss (which I assume would have been Wegovy approved), this was for diabetes, and it was under control with Rybelsus, and I assume Ozempic, though we were still in the process of building up to it (I was on max dose of Rybelsus and I'm pretty sure I needed the max Ozempic as well).  If they had given a reason for the denial it'd be one thing but it was just a blanket denial.I just hope this makes it easier for folks who need it to be able to obtain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very glad to see this, it's worth noting that the compounded semiglutide pricing  (think generic, although it's more complicated than that) has been plummeting ever since it was introduced onto the market. We've seen some pretty incredible results and I really hope they get cheap enough to be prescribed more widely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be easier to squeeze Novo if they included Zepbound from Eli Lilly in the mix - we could argue that if we're going to spend unfathomable amounts on these medications we might as well buy the more effective medication from an American company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737985</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great idea combining batman with libp2p! You guys have the heart in the right place :-).Currently, your project seems to be an opinionated wrapper ontop of libp2p. For this to become a proper distributed toolkit you lack an abstraction to for apps to collaborate over shared state (incl. convergence after partition). Come up with a good abstraction for that, and make it work p2p (e.g. delta state based CRDTs, or op-based CRDTs based on a replicated log; event sourcing ..). Tangentially related, a consensus abstraction might also be handy for some applications.Also check out [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) as a potential awesome replacement for p2p; as well as [Actyx](https://github.com/Actyx/Actyx) as an inspiration of similar (sadly failed) project using rust-libp2p.Oh, and you might want to give your docs a grammar review.Kudos for showing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;batman-advanced is a pretty interesting choice for a routing / handshake mechanism. Are your own applications mostly focussed on 802.11s Wi-Fi or where does the choice come from?In Profinet / Ethernet based networks it's more common to use ARP or mDNS for the discovery because multicast addresses are supported everywhere. Multicast DNS would be independent on top of the existing network layer and compatible with smartphones and other consumer devices (and even printers). That's why I'm asking, was there a specific reason to not use mDNS?Airprint, airscan, filedrop and other things are based on bonjour (mDNS-SD), and supported pretty well on consumer devices and routers. [1][1] http://dns-sd.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the architecture document here.[1]The usual problems with these things are discovery and security. Discovery is done via local WiFi broadcast. Not clear how security is done. How do you allow ad-hoc networking yet disallow hostile actors from connecting?[1] https://docs.p2p.industries/concepts/architecture/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694384</guid></item><item><title>30.

    - Is the dealer obligated to disclose data collection?

I'll be in the market for a new car in the next few years but I do not want to buy anything that tracks or collects ANY data about me.I was assuming that buying a cheap non-electric car would offer some protection but I'd love to know more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the FTC. Why and how did they start protecting consumer privacy? Could they have done it before? Do they have an overall systematic plan for protecting it comprehensively? Do they have a guiding principle?I'm glad they are moving forward on it, at least until Monday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about monetary compensation? People lost real money, damages can be calculated.After all, if I installed spying software on GM's computers, and sold the extracted data to, say, Toyota, I'd face hefty fines.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm one of the creators of OpenHands (fka OpenDevin). I agree with most of what's been said here, wrt to software agents in general.We are not even close to the point where AI can "replace" a software engineer. Their code still needs to be reviewed and tested, at least as much as you'd scrutinize the code of a brand new engineer just out of boot camp. I've talked to companies who went all in on AI engineers, only to realize two months later that their codebase was rotting because no one was reviewing the changes.But once you develop some intuition for how to use them, software agents can be a _massive_ boost to productivity. ~20% of the commits to the OpenHands codebase are now authored or co-authored by OpenHands itself. I especially love asking it to do simple, tedious things like fixing merge conflicts or failing linters. It's great at getting an existing PR over the line.It's also important to keep in mind that these agents are literally improving on a _weekly_ basis. A few weeks ago we were at the top of the SWE-bench leaderboard; now there are half a dozen agents that have pulled ahead of us. And we're one launch away from leapfrogging back to the top. Exciting times!https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who uses AI coding tools daily and has done a fair amount of experimentation with different approaches (though not Devin), I feel like this tracks pretty well. The problem is that Devin and other "agentic" approaches take on more than they can handle. The best AI coders are positioned as tools for developers, rather than replacements for them.Github Copilot is "a better tab complete". Sure, it's a neat demo that it can produce a fast inverse square root, but the real utility is that it completes repetitive code. It's like having a dynamic snippet library always available that I never have to configure.Aider is the next step up the abstraction ladder. It can edit in more locations than just the current cursor position, so it can perform some more high-level edit operations. And although it also uses a smarter model than Copilot, it still isn't very "smart" at the end of the day, and will hallucinate functions and make pointless changes when you give it a problem to solve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one of the big problems with Devin (and AI agents in general) is that they're only ever as good as they are. Sometimes their intelligence feels magical and they accomplish things within minutes that even mid level or senior software engineers would take a few hours to do. Other times, they make simple mistakes and no matter how much help you give, they run around in circles.A big quality that I value in junior engineers is coachability. If an AI agent can't be coached (and it doesn't look like it right now), then there's no way I'll ever enjoy using one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734681</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-planned steps by Planner will go wrong more often than not, as it will try to guess the UI layers from its memory/training data. Its better to just ask the "next step" by giving it current state of the UI.I have built a similar project for mobile automation [1] and the validator phase is not separate rather it's inherently baked in each step since we only ask next step based on current UI and previous actions.My Planner sometimes goes "Oh, we are still on home screen, let's find the Uber app icon". This sort of self-correcting behaviour was not programmed but the LLM does it on its own.1. https://github.com/BandarLabs/ClickClickClick - A framework to automate mobile use via any LLM (local/remote)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many of the examples given for agents such as this are things I just flat wouldn’t  trust an LLM to do - buying something on Amazon for example: Will it pick new or ‘renewed’?  Will it select an item that is from a janky looking vendor and may be counterfeit? Will it pick the cheapest option for me?  What if multiple colors are offered?This one example alone has so many branches that would require knowing what’s in my head.On the flip side, it’s a ridiculously simple task for a human to do for themselves, so what am I truly saving?Call me when I can ask it to check the professional reviews of X category on N websites (plus YouTube), summarize them for me, and find the cheapest source for the top 2 options in the category that will arrive in Y days or sooner.That would be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UI is most common interface but not particularly AI friendly, i'll wait for more standardized interface that's both human and AI friendly.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. This is a bit of an unusual project, but I can break down the gist of it in two main pieces.The first is a new web-based, real-time nonlinear optics simulator for the situation of light propagating within a reflective cavity with an adaptive lens structure at the center. My understanding of the landscape of NLO simulators is there's not much real-time or for the web, so extracting that bit of code (within simulation.js) may be a decent starting point for other projects. That said, depending on what your goals for simulation the level of accuracy provided by a real-time simulation may not be sufficient. My understanding is that if you are doing detailed simulation to refine e.g. lens structures intended for production in the real world you likely need more detailed modeling than the slow varying envelope approximation (SVEA) that I use here.The other aspect of the project is a little difficult to describe but I was basically trying to create a minimal idealized model of a setup with nonlinear dynamics controlled by an optimization process as a kind of "pendulum" setup for whatever's the minimal essential magic behind the efficacy of e.g. transformer models. The exploration is not complete, but the idea was basically like: is there some switch where an alteration in technique in the optimization structure ends up being a step-function more effective in controlling the light fields than without. That's the general idea. More specifically what started the project though was being curious whether you could in some way use waves reflected from a boundary as an error signal for a backpropagation-like process. I found out in the course of my work here that this has been done in practice using phase-conjugate waves to encode the corrections. In order to create these phase-conjugate waves you'd need a "four-wave mixing" setup, which the simulation in its present state does not support but could be extended to.A note on process: this project was basically kicked off because I tried one-shotting a basic version of it with openai's o1 model and it worked a lot better than I was expecting, so much of the motivation here was also to see how much I could use sota LLMs to assist on a project like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is extremely cool! Curious on the story behind this /u/westoncb!It reminds me of Huygens Optics' recent videos about modelling particles as confined light using a particular non-linear medium [0], is it possible to create similar 'light' particles with tweaks to your setup?[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP5Pbx8I4s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does nonlinear optics also create harmonics as with nonlinear electronics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731417</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The website is a comprehensive guide to the Lua programming language, specifically presenting the "Programming in Lua" book, which serves as both an introduction and an in-depth resource. It covers essential topics such as Lua's syntax, data types, functions, and modules, as well as advanced concepts like coroutines and object-oriented programming. The guide is structured in chapters that provide explanations, examples, and practical applications, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers looking to enhance their skills with Lua.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me Lua, from a minimalism point of view, feels like the Go of dynamically typed languages.I love how you can acquire the language easily within a very short period of time (apart from some idioms, which like in other languages take more practice). I appreciate the low number of keywords and that you have only one real way to structure data, through tables. Yet, you can use meta tables to "emulate" classes as blueprints for object creation and even inheritance, if you really need OOP, or for that matter other paradigms. In a way this reminds me of JavaScript prototypes.As an indie game dev, Love2D really clicked. Lua is awesome as a scripting language inside a host language like C/C++/Rust, because it is simple, intuitive (both for imperative or functional styles) and rather fast.I'm even using it as my go-to scripting language for the Linux CLI instead of Python. Python, as great as it is, feels sometimes too comprehensive for small scripts. I like to script using a language I can fully keep in my "working memory", without having to refresh my memory about some constructs/idioms. That said, I use Rust as my main statically typed language, so maybe I'm just finding excuses for my love for Lua...I also think Lua is underrated as a possible first language. Its simplicity, readability and details like using keywords for blocks (do, end, etc) IMO make it suitable for beginners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in Lua every day as a game developer. A GOTY in 2023 being my highest achievement so far. By and large Lua just gets out of the way, which is the most important thing for me.
 I have some minor issues with it, nothing huge, and I work around them with some utility functions that I've created or collected over the years.The most recent edition of this book is from 2016. Surely time for a new edition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This the latest edition I know about being online somewhere: https://archive.org/details/pil-4th (Programming In Lua - Fourth edition, for Lua 5.3, 2016)I'm not sure there is a fifth edition (for Lua 5.4) but the manual/reference + fourth edition seems good enough for at least my usage: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682777</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The domain (digital) might be less important than the role.As a contributor, you have to be an expert, but you're really not on the hook.As a decider, you can be a generalist, but you're on the hook.The traditional mid-life transition is from contributor to decider, into management or starting your own company.In my lifetime, the value of contributors has diminished while the value of deciders has exploded, largely due to the pace of change and the leverage of capital.  Contributor skills get stale fast, but deciders making the right decision at the right time is a gold mine, waiting to be tapped by capital leveraging the latest tech/policy.Also, I think people mature more as deciders.  It grows confidence and effectiveness.  Contributors grow to become defensive and stuck, i.e., dependent on being specifically useful.It's tempting to look for nearby opportunities, but it may be more transformative to ask what kind of person you want to be in 10 years (and what will the world be like).  If you operate from that perspective, you're leveraging world change and relatively immune to personal difficulty.  People respect that, and you can be proud of making your way instead of just fitting in.Becoming a principal rather than an agent is something (like meditation) that applies at all fractal scales of life, so you can re-orient while in current roles.And don't worry too much about realistic.  Focus more on delivering value, and the principle of least action will arrange things for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting jobs I've seen are where people bring two specializations together, into a single role.Take the strategy, user research and frameworks you do to drive better CX, and apply that to something you have a deep interest in away from the usual mainstream. It could be a hobby, it could be the cyber stuff you're interested in.On that, you're more likely to enjoy getting into cybersecurity by joining a company doing that today as a CX expert and getting more technical over time and looking for a horizontal move, than you are from starting from scratch and working on an IT help desk and trying to work your way up.I'd also suggest starting a blog or producing open source content in the field you want to move into. I'm starting to do this, because it can highlight my knowledge/skills while my CV is in a completely different field, in order to gently build traction and attention in my "target" industry.One last thought: don't underestimate that you're stressed, burned out and just need a decent period of slow work to recover. I think most people looking for major changes in their career are just tired and fed up. I know I am. They say a change is as good as a rest, but a rest is as good as a rest as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a 15 year JavaScript developer. Now I run operations for an enterprise API system at a large organization.My career stagnated as a JavaScript developer. Most of my peers were afraid to write original software which made it really challenging to do anything until I was finally laid off from worst of it. Everything had to be little more than copy/paste from some enormous framework into an enormous mono…monster of stupidity. If you ever proposed sanity people would get irate because it threatens to expose that nobody has idea what they are doing.Simultaneously, though, I have a part time job in the military. In the military I learned networking (routers and switches), operations, security, management, and more. I still maintain my security certs and have a clearance.Last year a recruiter reached out to me about a work from home job writing enterprise APIs. I passed the interview using my knowledge of data structures and the inner mechanics of WebSockets from years of writing personal software. For most of my career as a JavaScript developer it seemed the only way I could program at all was to do it on my own outside of work.Since then they promoted to lead operations and at the same time to be a team lead in a different organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42735767</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Derelict" delves into the story of a forgotten and abandoned ship, exploring its mysterious history and the maritime legends surrounding it. It recounts the discovery of this vessel, its once-glorious adventures, and how it eventually fell into decay, capturing the allure of shipwrecks and the stories they leave behind. The narrative reflects on themes of neglect, time, and the tales that emerge from objects left to the ravages of nature. Through vivid imagery and storytelling, the piece invites readers to ponder the fates of such forgotten relics of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a research paper on RealGPU, an efficient architecture for GPU-based computing that addresses the limitations of traditional NoCs (Network on Chips). It proposes a novel design that aims to improve data communication and resource utilization within multi-GPU systems, enhancing performance scalability and reducing energy consumption. The paper discusses the architectural innovations and experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of RealGPU in terms of throughput and latency compared to existing solutions. Additionally, it highlights the potential for RealGPU to advance applications in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth guide to mastering the Isolated Queen Pawn (IQP) in chess, detailing its characteristics, strategic advantages, and common tactics associated with this pawn structure. It explores the positioning of pieces, typical plans for both sides when an IQP is present, and tips for effectively managing the strengths and weaknesses that arise from this configuration. Through examples and illustrative games, the guide aims to enhance players' understanding of the complexities involved in games featuring an isolated queen pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This analysis is largely drawn from the book Winning Pawn Structures by Baburin (1998), which the blog author credits. Most chess books do not keep their relevance past 5 years, so it's a great testament to the quality of the book that it's still highly esteemed today.Baburin is a Russian-born Grandmaster who came to Ireland around 1993. You might think the popularity of this book would have led to a generation of Irish players who specialized in IQP positions. But instead the opposite seemed to happen: it bred a generation who assumed their opponents had read the book, felt they hadn't mastered it themselves, and avoided those positions with both Black and White.A contributing factor was that this book was more difficult for young intermediate players to grasp than an openings manual, where you can improve your results just by memorising a few extra lines. Perhaps also that there just wasn't the same culture of chess and chess education that other European countries had: Irish players just weren't used to being taught how to play the middlegame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chess is such an interesting game wish more poor children had access resources to learn it without sthe stressors of poverty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680796</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "In Defence of Productivity Crap" argues that productivity tools and techniques, often dismissed as gimmicky or ineffective, can actually offer valuable insights and motivation for individuals looking to improve their efficiency. The author defends the use of various productivity hacks and frameworks, explaining that while they may not work universally, they can spark creativity and help individuals find their own methods of productivity. By embracing these tools without rigidly adhering to them, people can discover what truly enhances their workflow and personal effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an autistic individual, I find task management systems invaluable not for their own sake, but because they help me overcome my natural difficulty in switching between detailed and big-picture thinking. While I excel at focusing on details, I can struggle to identify true priorities. My simple system (voice memos processed through Claude) helps me intentionally zoom between granular tasks and high-level priorities. This isn't about getting lost in productivity tools - it's about having the right support structure for how my brain naturally works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you know what needs to be done, you don't need "productivity", you just need to work.When you don't know what needs to be done, no amount of "productivity" will compensate for the fact that any work you do is meaningless and any result thereof accidental.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading both posts it sounds like they're in violent agreement rather than disagreeing. There is a lot of FOMO in the aesthetics of productivity but at the end of the day everyone needs a system. It's wise to balance trying to improve the system with getting work done.Personally I run with a very minimalist setup, am unlikely to change software defaults unless I need too, keep a todo list for myself and use whatever we're using this week to work with others.I do wonder how much the more productivity systems optimizing people are measuring the actual result versus chasing aesthetics but at the same time I've not noticed it being a net drain so don't particularly care. In part I think it's a case of doing what works for you unless it becomes detrimental. There's a lot to be said for ritual making you comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681969</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of cascading Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and critiques the traditional implementation of this framework within organizations. It argues that while OKRs can enhance alignment and focus, the conventional top-down approach often leads to rigidity and a lack of engagement among teams. The author proposes a more flexible and collaborative method for setting OKRs, encouraging feedback and adaptability to better achieve results and foster a culture of ownership across all levels of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

At that reading -- I forget the exact context -- but either Kevin, or possibly another poet deadpanned the word "straight" in a poem, which got a few MFA students in a tussy, which was kinda funny. (For context, Killian has won awards for his gay erotic fiction.)Super nice guy. Wished me happy birthday on Facebook every year, even though we'd only talked maybe two or three times. I was very sad to hear of his passing a few years back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got the opportunity to get to know Kevin in the mid 1990's.  He was visiting Vancouver and created a play for some local artists and writers to perform in, me being one of them.   He was a generous, brilliant man and sorely missed.

They are free apps, running on a shoestring budget.But that whole account looks a little dodgy. The posts make it seem like one of those "I made $30K/mo, from my living room! You can too!" outfits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run your cloud contracts (or anything possible to incur liability) through a separate LLC so if there are billing issues you can just move on.The structure should look like:"My App LLC" has contract with "My Host LLC" for hosting services. "My Host LLC" provides those services via a cloud provider. If "My Host LLC" racks up a 2 million dollar bill with the cloud provider and goes out of business then I just move to "New Host LLC" and carry on.It's not as if the patients of a Doctor who fails to pay his office rent would become liable.This is the entire purpose of LLCs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the days before, there used to be a hard spending limit - I know this because of an old official tutorial video on youtube. Last time I checked, there was billing alert functionality and they were recommending creating a function that will halt your service when it hits the limit - the problem is, billing lags behind and you can rack up a hefty sum until anything is triggered.Amazing service but its a scary one. Every time a social-media-worthy accident happens, they cancel the bill but I wonder how many are burned without recourse.Maybe if your rack up something modest like 5K accidentally, its better to push it as high as you can and get it declined  on your CC and increase your social media prospects :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732714</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having made an 4 year excursion from IT into the world of making gears, I can attest that what seems like something fairly simple from the outside really isn't.Just like a bearing, gears (ideally) have a rolling contact. The smoother and harder the faces the better, until you get to the point where fractures and spalling occur. The best gears are cut, sent out to be hardened via heat treat, then ground (with "superfinishing") to exact size. As with bearings, you have to get the size just right for long life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of SKF's sponsorship of the new Marble Machine by Martin from WintergatanSee for example this video, how to choose your ball bearinghttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-BgMiC2yg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting away Mosquitos (the real Wunderwaffe of that war) for freight runs (and for stuffing the occasional Nobel Price physicist in the bomb bay) tells a rather different story about the importance of swedish-made ball bearings for UK arms production:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37884749&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743673</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of software on the fast food industry, highlighting how technology enhances efficiency and customer experience. It details various software solutions that streamline operations, such as digital ordering systems, inventory management, and employee scheduling tools.

Overall, it underscores the transformation of fast food operations through software innovation, contributing to better service and operational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like someone who hasn't been in the industry long enough to know what it is like to try and design software before implementing it with groups larger than 3, and yearns for problems that aren't as complex as the ones they are dealing with.It is easy to build "home cooked" (by his definition) software when you are building for a small number of people by a small number of people. Old Visual Basic programs built for a single version of Linux will do just fine - and that will work well for some use cases. But if you are building software that has to work on thousands to millions of machines, and fulfill their needs, you will need to build a factory to build that software.The factory, in this case, is the infrastructure necessary to turn the R&amp;D (you and me) into the repeatable product (that is, your app.) The factories need a lot of maintenance. If nobody is buying your product, you need to change the factory to produce outputs that people are buying. If people have bought your product (let's say... on subscription) then you need to keep the factory maintained well enough to produce the product that people are happy to buy.Some things will be like tarsnap and change relatively little. That's great. A small shop will need less maintenance. A bigger shop that is a factory for more users with wider needs will need more complicated products and that will mean more maintenance.But yes, if you don't need to have a return on investment, you don't need to react to customers' needs and therefore you can build a spec first and let it change little. (Or, you build something as niche and as good as Tarsnap!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I couldn't disagree with the premise of the sections more on development methodology&gt; Fast Food
&gt; Here, we develop in "agile" sprints. Working software is developed at the fastest pace possible, and all bugs are to be fixed later.&gt; Home Cooked
&gt; Here, things are slower, more thoughtful. More waterfall-y.While Sprints is a term that sounds like fastest pace possible, that is not what the term means; and a key part about waterfall vs agile is that waterfall IS NOT more thoughtful, but all planned up front.Both methodologies can create bugs, or deliver features faster than scale can be thought of and deliver features faster than can be tested.If we remove the quotes from "agile" we actually get slower and thoughtful. A key part of that is measuring (training, interviewing, analyzing). An agile process should build a feature, release that feature, interview users, analyze system behavior, iterate by improving user's goal, adding appropriate scale, iterating by removing unexpected errors or behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the same vein, I recommend reading this post by Robin Sloan

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Geerling's article discusses the creation of a compact and portable homelab called the "Project Mini Rack." The project focuses on building a small-scale server rack that can house various hardware components essential for a homelab setup, offering insights into design considerations, equipment choices, and practical implementation. Geerling shares his experiences and challenges faced during the process, providing valuable tips for readers looking to set up their own efficient and space-saving homelabs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that he linked an inexpensive "260W GaN USB-C Charging Station".It's less than $30 with a coupon, which seems to good to be true.A look at the Amazon 2-star reviews suggests it has good build quality but can only output 75W to 100W total, not 260W as advertised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I don't understand about these Pi based mini-racks is why you would build a home lab that's less powerful than your client devices. My 24 U rack exists precisely because I want on demand, large amounts of compute/GPU for compiling, transcoding, encrypting, etc. and the cloud is too expensive. If you're going to make the investment into any type of home labbing, why gimp yourself with devices that can only run small services you could run on a single old desktop using containers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have zero need for a portable raspberry pi cluster but damn is this cool anyway.Also, I learned about this device from this post and immediately bought one for my existing home server remote access: https://jetkvm.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738284</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines what users can expect from the upcoming release month of the Zig programming language. It highlights key features and improvements, such as enhancements in the compiler, standard library updates, and significant bug fixes. Additionally, it discusses community involvement, upcoming events, and the importance of feedback from users to shape the language's development. Overall, it emphasizes the excitement around the new features and the commitment to making Zig more efficient and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

The memory safety guardrails are just high enough to help out without feeling like a tourist trap.There is space to enjoy writing code with someone’s PhD dissertation, untyped dynamic free for alls, and all that in between. Zig feels like a hacker's language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been a lurking fan of Zig for a while. Discovering they listen to IM and Bliss to code to just made me like their project even more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding Aro (new C compiler in the Zig toochain), it seems that a C compiler written in Zig shortens considerably the path to supporting constexpr in C using Zig's comptime capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737345</guid></item><item><title>48.

If you haven't seen the inside of LexusNexus, it is a stalkers paradise. I got a glimpse when I talked to some guys about helping them with some python automation. Turned out they use LexusNexus to figure out who to buy mineral rights from for fracking nat gas. They gloated how they used deep personal data to do thing like play spouses against each other as they are going through a divorce. I walked away because of basic human values and ethics I feel need to be upheld&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am having trouble making sense the word "parks" in the title. Is "GM parks" an entity, or is this a mistake and "parks" is just an extra verb in there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So basically if I get out of the store not paying I'm going to jail, but big companies when doing crime, they promise they will behave for five years, and then go on, but more openly?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re looking for a compressor.Lots of pro audio boxes out there.A MiniDSP box where you can implement a compressor is fun, you can also tune just about everything else with it.https://docs.minidsp.com/product-manuals/flex/dsp-reference/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 - Get an amplifier that has a "Night Mode" function. It has been a basic function on most AV-receivers in the past decade+, assuming you don't buy the most pedestrian model. It compresses the dynamic range of the sound, to avoid the loud parts waking up the neighbors while you can also hear the conversations. Of course here you are looking for an investment of between $350 and $inf. Buying secondhand can save big bucks.2 - Use a PC for your video needs. Most video players support the same function (VLC, GOM player, Kodi... look for "dynamic range compression" and similar options). A 10 years old mid-tier machine will play everything including UHD, so this solution is fairly cheap. If you get a cheap IR-USB remote, you won't even have to mess with keyboard and mouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your source is Dolby Digital, you may not need anything new - just adjusting your settings. Dynamic range compression is a standard feature, and the bitstream should already include the necessary metadata for the decoder to implement this.It's been a while since I looked into this in detail, but iirc the decoder must automatically enable dynamic range compression when it's set to two channel output. So avoid configurations where you first convert the audio to 5.1 channel PCM or analog, and then apply downmixing or virtual surround.If you're using a surround system, most receivers have a night mode as mentioned by others already. Some have also an adaptive system that adjusts the dynamic range based on your volume setting - turn it up and you get the full dynamic range, turn it down and the dynamic range is compressed more as you set the volume lower to try to keep the dialog audible. Many receivers include a microphone for automatic settings, and after calibration know the actual output level. The Dolby Digital bitstream (and I think DTS) include a flag to indicate the overall dialog level, and based on these a receiver can do quite a good job. Some I think go only by the DD metadata, others have a compressor that can be applied to any input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42702507</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting to quit working is a different feeling. You may spend time in the first month untangling your role and your ego. I had no idea how important the status was to me until I was just a guy, at home, that no one needed. It was a valuable lesson about self worth, and one that stayed around after I rejoined the work force.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit his job to start a company. Probably different from quitting with the intent to look for another job, or take a break, or retire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quit a hell of a job (in the good sense!) kinda out of nowhere at a point in my career where I was in a great upward trajectory to go on an "indefinite sabbatical" (turned out to be 7 months).I did not quit to start a company, but the sense of multiple plunges does resonate.From my perspective:- It's very hard to detach yourself from stable (and growing) personal finances- The comparison aspect is always there, you just need to learn to manage it- The most rewarding bit was re-adjusting my metric of what's sufficient/enough in life- I was not familiar with that video, but, indeed, I did learn to ask myself "would you rather be doing something else?" and the answer was no- I learned to dream again- As soon as I pulled the trigger on the decision I was flooded by a sense of insecurity even if I was really certain of itI wrote stuff about it at the time but never published it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688834</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the National Archives' initiative to recruit volunteers to help transcribe and decipher cursive handwriting from historic documents. It highlights the challenges posed by cursive writing, particularly for younger generations who may not be familiar with it. The project aims to make these documents more accessible and to preserve historical records for future research and education. The National Archives encourages individuals to participate by providing guidance on how to get involved and contribute to this important work of transcription and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a really interesting project. But boy do they make it hard to participate.* Article doesn't provide a direct link to the topic mission* Signup is pretty easy. Well organized and even gently requires you to have two forms of 2FA.* Sign up complete. Go back to the primary page and try to find the mission. A little buried but not too deep.* Notice I'm not signed in. Ok, let's do that. Now I'm back on the main page and navigate back. Find the first document and open it. Really interesting to scan through the doc and to read. People back then generally had really nice handwriting.* Ok, what next, how do I transcribe? ... ? Oh it says I'm not logged in again. Fine, click the link and...* I'm logged in and directed back to the main page, again.Look, this is an interesting project and I'd love to spend my spare cycles to help out. But they really need to clean up this process.Volunteers shouldn't have to jump through kinda poorly designed interfaces to help out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before commenting asking about why they don't just use LLMs, please note that the article specifically calls out that they do, but it's not always a viable solution:&gt; The agency uses artificial intelligence and a technology known as optical character recognition to extract text from historical documents. But these methods don’t always work, and they aren’t always accurate.The document at the top is likely an especially easy document to read precisely because it's meant to be the hook to get people to sign up and get started. It isn't going to be representative of the full breadth of documents that the National Archives want people to go through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok I did one letter, from a woman in 1814 writing to James Monroe (then Secretary of State) asking for a passport to go to Scotland to get her late brother's property. What a trip! So enjoyable to get into the flow once you've "synchronized" with the persons handwriting. Furthermore, due to the fact that you're reading and re-writing word for word of whatever you're transcribing, the stories you end up reading have tremendous memory-stick. This is not surprising, considering that you are dedicating an inordinate amount of time per page, but it's a welcome side effect when you try and recollect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745334</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks neat. I have to look up the very fiddly and unintuitive systemd commands all the time. service start? service.foo start? start foo.service? Oh right, sudo systemctl start service.fooAnd the feedback is so bad. It should know everything in its own config dir and tell me how to do what I want to do. Was it enabled? I forget. How do I look at logs? Oh right journalctl. Also the layout of things with lots of symlinks and weird directories in places that annoy my 90's linux sysadmin brain. Why am I looking at /lib/systemd/systemI am annoyed by the redundant "systemd/system" directory name every time I have to go there. At this point, just promote it to /etc/systemd and build a better CLI.As a very occasional linux sysadmin just trying to make things work, the "typing at a console" systemd interfaces are not fun to work with. Maybe nobody should be doing that. In an enterprise, sure that's different. I think interfaces should be human, and linux should still be fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice.One thing I found systemd really confusing was its treatment of ExecStop in a service script.  ExecStart is the command to run when systemd starts the service at system boot up (or when a user tells systemd to start the service).  However, ExecStop is run when the starting command has finished running.  You have to set RemainAfterExit=yes to have the desired function of running the stop command on system shutdown or on user stopping the service.  ExecStop is basically the "on-cleanup" event rather than "to-shutdown-the-service" event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this. I use raw CLI commands until it hurts, and have recently embraced tools like lazygit/lazydocker to get visibility into otherwise opaque system/tree states, and it’s been a huge level-up.I have several user and system level services I manage, but debugging them is tedious. Your opening line that lists common commands and their pain points really resonated with me.I’m on NixOS, so editing immutable unit files directly won’t work, but the service discovery, visibility, and management will be really helpful. Nice work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42749402</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth exploration of the AMD Radeon Instinct MI300A, a high-performance accelerator designed for data centers and AI computations. It highlights the card's architecture, which integrates both CPU and GPU components on a single chip, enhancing speed and efficiency for machine learning and other intensive workloads. The piece discusses its features, including advanced memory options and performance specifications, while comparing it to competitors in the market. Additionally, it emphasizes the implications of the MI300A for cloud computing and the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often thought that one of the places AMD could distinguish itself from NVIDIA is bringing significantly higher amounts of VRAM (or memory systems that are as performant as what we currently know as VRAM) to the consumer space.A card with a fraction of the FLOPS of cutting-edge graphics cards (and ideally proportionally less power consumption), but with 64-128GB VRAM-equivalent, would be a gamechanger for letting people experiment with large multi-modal models, and seriously incentivize researchers to build the next generation of tensor abstraction libraries for both CUDA and ROCm/HIP. And for gaming, you could break new grounds on high-resolution textures. AMD would be back in the game.Of course, if it's not real VRAM, it needs to be at least somewhat close on the latency and bandwidth front, so let's pop on over and see what's happening in this article...&gt; An Infinity Cache hit has a load-to-use latency of over 140 ns. Even DRAM on the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D shows less latency. Missing Infinity Cache of course drives latency up even higher, to a staggering 227 ns. HBM stands for High Bandwidth Memory, not low latency memory, and it shows.Welp. Guess my wish isn't coming true today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the 300A is an accelerator coupled with a full 24-core EPYC and 128GB of HBM all on a single chip (or, packaged chiplets, whatever).Why is it I can't buy a single one of these, on a motherboard, in a workstation format case, to use as an insane workstation?  Assuming you could program for the accelerator part, there is an entire world of x86-fixed CAD, engineering, and entertainment industry (rendering, etc) where people want a single, desktop machine with 128GB + of fast ram to number crunch.There are Blender artists out there that build dual and quad RTX4090 machines with Threadrippers for $20k+ in components all day, because their render jobs pay for it.There are engineering companies that would not bat an eye at dropping $30k on a workstation if it mean they could spin around 80 gigabyte CATIA models of cars or aircraft loaded in RAM quicker. I know this at least because I sure as hell did with with several HP Z-series machines costing whole-Toyota-Corolla prices over the years...But these combined APU chips are relegated to these server units.  In the end is this a driver problem?  Just a software problem?  A chicken and egg problem where no one is developing the support because there isn't the hardware on the market, and there isn't the hardware on the market because AMD thinks there is no use case?Edit: and note my use cases mentioned don't rely on latency, really, like videogamers need to hit framerates.  The cache miss latency mentioned in the article doesn't matter as much for these type of compute applications where the main problems are just loading and unloading the massive amount of data.  Things like offline renders and post-processing CFD simulations.  Not necessarily a video output framerate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;its interesting that two simultaneous and contradictory views are held by AI engineers:- Software is over- An impenetrable software moat protects Nvidia's market capitalization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747864</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Infinite Wave Function Collapse (Infinite WFC) algorithm, an extension of the traditional Wave Function Collapse (WFC) model used for procedural content generation. It explores how the Infinite WFC allows for the generation of large, unbounded content by tiling and seamlessly extending patterns, making it suitable for applications in game development and other areas where endless environments are needed. The article provides insights into the algorithm's workings, implementation details, and potential use cases, along with examples to illustrate its effectiveness in creating complex and visually appealing structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700483"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work with this algorithm quite a bit in a personal project. (I've changed from calling it WFC to Model Synthesis; Paul Merrell earned the naming rights, unless we discover an even earlier description.)I mentally divide it into two important components:1. Cross-correlation  (the 'wave function')2. Label selection (choosing where the 'collapse' occurs)The "cross-correlation" is exactly what it sounds like - given an incomplete model and a set of example patterns, this data structure represents the cross-correlation of every place that any of the patterns would individually fit in the incomplete model.  I think this is the most useful structure in the algorithm, and is a form of iterative 'feature detection' over the incomplete model.I think there are many interesting things which can be done with this which aren't in the basic algorithm, such as:- Having larger indivisible 'patterns' and collapsing such patterns all at once.  Although example patterns are always broken down into discrete cells, larger patterns can exist where each cell gets a unique label and very limited transition set. The cross-correlation will detect where they can be placed, and if one is chosen the entire pattern could be chosen at once.- Partial seeding of labels, e.g. selecting portions of the incomplete model and artificially limiting the available labels in that area, without collapsing it.- Addition of information to labels which aren't easily expressed in an example pattern, such as rudimentary counting of distances.The 'label selection' portion (in WFC terms, this is the algorithm used to choose which space to 'collapse') is where all of the random generation comes into play.  If using Model Synthesis for full world generation, this is what should be focused on for generating more interesting types of environments.However, given the common label selection algorithms I've seen and used, I think that Model Synthesis excels mostly at adding small-scale, largely self-similar patterns onto constraints provided by a larger structure.  I think that other proc-gen methods better lend themselves to generating large-scale structures. A combination of the two - generating a large-scale structure to serve as a constraint, and allowing model synthesis to fill in interesting detail - seems like a good path to explore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think proc gen like this often falls victim to the 1000 bowls of oatmeal problem.Unless things _feel_ different, it just feels same-y.Some games handle this well (often through biomes with different rules and/or special areas with different rules) and others (interestingly, often those that talk about how many billions of possibilities there are) are techniquely different... But just all feel the same.It's interesting to see how game devs continue to be creative in this area and how many games continue to have this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People seem to go ga-ga over this algorithm with some frequency on HN, and I think it is only because of its in-name-only connection to quantum mechanics, because I have to say that as procedural generation algorithm I find it very lacking. It works on the cases I saw for something like a 10x10 grid decently enough but for any large-scale work it just produces endless seas of structureless repetition. Even the long-in-the-tooth "just fire Perlin noise at varying levels of detail at the problem" at least produces some overarching structure even if it is itself just random because the low-frequency, high-amplitude components you use will produce some sort of higher-level variation.Literally anything with any hierarchy in it would be better, unless you're really leaning into that SCP-esque, liminal-space creepiness. But if that isn't your explicit goal I would definitely not recommend this for large-scale usage because in most projects that creepy liminal-space-ness is probably actively fighting your artistic goals.It wouldn't even take that much; lay down some sort of street network with some other algorithm, a bit of "zoning" to switch some tile sets between "residential" and some other zone or even just a couple different types of "residental", perlin noise it up if you've got no better ideas, then use "wave function collapse" (I really dislike the in-name-only "quantumness" of the name, can hardly call the algorithm that with a straight face) to fill in the blocks. A straightforward implementation of that would still be pretty same-y but it would at least have some sort of structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700483</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of an Amazon web crawler designed to extract product data from Amazon's website. It highlights the challenges faced, such as navigating Amazon's complex site structures and handling anti-bot measures. The author shares insights into the technologies and methodologies employed in building the crawler, including the use of specific programming languages and libraries. The crawler's capabilities, potential use cases, and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping are also addressed, emphasizing the importance of adhering to legal guidelines and respecting website terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's time for a lawyer letter. See the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prosecution guidelines.[1] In general, the US Justice Department will not consider any access to open servers that's not clearly an attack to be "unauthorized access". But,"However, when authorizers later expressly revoke authorization—for example, through unambiguous written cease and desist communications that defendants receive and understand—the Department will consider defendants from that point onward not to be authorized."So, you get a lawyer to write an "unambiguous cease and desist" letter. You have it delivered to Amazon by either registered mail or a process server, as recommended by the lawyer. Probably both, plus email.Then you wait and see if Amazon stops.If they don't stop, you can file a criminal complaint. That will get Amazon's attention.[1] https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the solution in this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42727510.Put a link somewhere in your site that no human would visit, disallow it in robots.txt (under a wildcard because apparently OpenAI’s crawler specifically ignores wildcards), and when an IP address visits the link ban it for 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upvoted because we’re seeing the same behavior from all AI and Seo bots. They’re BARELY respecting Robots.txt, and hard to block. And when they crawl, they spam and drive up load so high they crash many servers for our clients.If AI crawlers want access they can either behave, or pay. The consequence will almost universal blocks otherwise!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750420</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study highlighted on NutraIngredients Asia reveals that an increased intake of potassium during dinner is associated with fewer sleep disturbances. The research suggests that consuming potassium-rich foods in the evening may enhance sleep quality by reducing issues such as waking up during the night. The article discusses the implications of these findings for dietary recommendations and emphasizes the importance of potassium for overall health, particularly in relation to sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't read too much into the title, the closing parts of the article give a much more balanced take on the whole issue. This study disagrees with some previous work and it's unclear which result makes sense and why. As usual, more research is needed, and while a catchy title is nice, this isn't anything to change your dietary habits by,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What isn't mentioned is that bananas and other potassium-rich foods are alkaline, and so can neutralize stomach acid reflux. Acid reflux is a common source of poor sleep quality. So that could be one explanation for the fewer sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this isn't related to potassium directly, but anecdotally I have had success using magnesium supplements for insomnia/improving general sleep quality. I have also been consuming electrolyte mixes containing potassium to help with muscle recovery from training, and have found them to help with physical soreness &amp; general well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742161</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the importance of bees and their role in ecosystem health. It highlights the various species of bees, their behaviors, and the critical services they provide, such as pollination, which is vital for the production of food and maintenance of biodiversity. The site also addresses the threats that bees face, including habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change, and encourages conservation efforts and practices to protect these essential pollinators. Additionally, it offers resources for individuals and communities to engage in bee-friendly initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honeybee queens are the only honeybees with stingers that don't die when they sting.  That's because the queen bee's stinger has no barbs, and the reason for that is that the queen must not die easily, and she must use her stinger, so if she's going to survive at all her stinger has to not have barbs.  The queen almost certainly has to use her stinger when she exits her cocoon: to kill ther other queens that are about to hatch or have hatched already.  She also has to possibly use her stinger when she goes out to mate (though she does go with attendants who will defend her if attacked).I was surprised not to find mention of this in TFA.&gt; A honey bee dies when it stings you because its stinger is covered in barbs, causing its abdomen to get ripped out when it tries to fly away. And surviving with your guts spilling out everywhere is pretty bloody hard.There's another interesting detail here: when the worker tries to fly off after stinging, she has to try really hard because the barbs hold the stinger in place, and trying hard causes two things to happen:  - noise that attracts other workers
    to attack the same creature
  
  - spreading of the dying bee's
    distress pheromones that also
    attract other workers to sting
    the same creature

So when you get stung by a bee near other bees you will be in trouble.  That's how you go from one sting to hundreds.  And hundreds is enough to kill a human.  That's why you don't go near a hive without protection.  Being in or near a swarm is safer than being near a hive: the bees in a swarm don't have much (larvae, honey) to protect, so they don't attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn’t that just so unbearably sad? These little creatures work tirelessly their whole lives, buzzing from flower to flower, pollinating the plants that sustain ecosystems and our food supply. They barely get to live a few weeks as worker bees, and then if they ever need to sting to protect their hive... that’s it. Their life ends in an act of ultimate devotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While a bee stinger may get stuck in you, that's not so when stinging fellow insects.The barbs don't catch on an exoskeleton like they do for thick and elastic mammalian skin.An elegant way to deliver more venom to larger targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42749069</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article highlights the playful and imaginative drawings created by Charles Darwin's children on the margins of his manuscripts. These illustrations, discovered in Darwin's notebooks, provide a glimpse into the family life and creativity of his children, showcasing their playful engagement with their father's scientific work. The piece celebrates the intersection of science and art, revealing how the children's sketches add a personal touch to Darwin's rigorous research, and invites readers to appreciate the lighter side of one of history's most significant scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t really care whose they are. I just love seeing any of these drawings.I have to imagine that drawing was a much greater source of entertainment at the time, and I’m kind of sad that that isn’t the case any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The project’s direc­tor, David Kohn, “doesn’t know for cer­tain which kids were the artists,” notes Staynor, “but he guess­es that at least three were involved: Fran­cis, who became a botanist; George, who became an astronomer and math­e­mati­cian; and Horace, who became an engi­neer.”Are we sure these were all from the children and none were the work of their father? Why couldn't Charley have thrown in a silly doodle himself?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not really exposed to children’s drawings, but these look particularly talented.I always feel a little weird about generating AI art because it really is   standing on the shoulders of giants. I’d say it’s the closest thing to when Napster got everyone used to theft.Any little simple drawing you generate is really off the back of kids and teenagers that draw out of a passion. So I try not to do it, feels icky.Ideally we want a world where we license the artist’s style, and hopefully they can get paid out like streaming music artists in the long term. Along with that, we need laws that let you sue people that copy the style with no license.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711012</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;hey! this is the inventor, danielle fong.thanks to curl-up who posted this, whoever you are.since it came up, "wire-to-wire" efficiency is what I intended to coin a synonym for electrical to electrical efficiency, with hydrogen storage. for example, an 80% electrical to hydrogen efficiency, and a 50% hydrogen to electrical efficiency, would yield a 40% wire to wire (electrical to electrical) efficiency. of course, people are working on 95% electric to hydrogen efficiency, and 50% fuel to electrical efficiency is a target.here's an illustrative energy flow diagram for us trying to hit 60% -- even more  aggressive.  https://x.com/DanielleFong/status/1775595848887677138&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The energy densities listed are flagged as approximate, so grains of salt etc, but the numbers on the page aren't entirely consistent.The stated energy density is "&gt; 500 watthours/liter".But higher on the page we see a relative-energy-density bar graph shows lightcell at 5x the energy density of lithium batteries, and (38/5 =) 7.6x less dense then petrol.  This implies an energy density for lightcell of 1250 Wh/liter, as (according to Google) petrol clocks in just under 9500 Wh/liter, and (again according to Google) lithium batteries can reach 300 Wh/liter so let's call it 250 for the math to work out.I'm curious which number is closer to truth: 500Wh/liter, or 1250?  Is 1250 the theoretical max and 500 the current output in a test rig?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bottom line: 40% efficiency, which is better than I expected but the competition is batteries at 80+% efficiency.  It's a hard sell, especially as continual improvements in battery storage will continue to eat away at their niche.5,000 W/kg sounds great on paper compared to 150 W/kg for batteries and is even in the same ballpark as gasoline at 12,000 W/kg, but I think that's just the figure for the fuel.  I don't think it includes storage, the solar panels, the burner, etc...  The cost is an open ended question as well.  Maybe this will pan out for aircraft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697001</guid></item><item><title>11.

For example, it described the motto "urbi et orbi" as "urb-eye e.t. orbee".Movement is very jerky (maybe because of my old computer?) and I was disappointed that I could only roam freely around the wireframe model, not any of the photographic images. Because of the jerkiness, it was sometimes hard to tell what part of the architecture I was looking at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The necropolis of Roman tombs, over which the Basilica was built, and what is claimed to be Peter's Tomb, can actually be visited, deep in the bowels of the Basilica.  To do so one must sign up for the Scavi Tour and book well in advance as only very small groups are taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I visited St. Peter's Basilica a few years ago. I highly recommend it.I had to exit the experience because my laptop (admittedly a few years old) could only give me 1-2 frames per second. I love the idea, but in the current state, viewing hi-res pictures would give you a better experience than this virtual 3d tour, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731740</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always telling this whenever the topic of Kalman Filters come up:If you're learning the Kalman Filter in isolation, you're kind of learning it backwards and missing out on huge "aha" moments that the surrounding theory can unlock.To truly understand the Kalman Filter, you need to study Least Squares (aka linear regression), then recursive Least Squares, then the Information Filter (which is a different formulation of the KF).
Then you'll realize the KF is just recursive Least Squares reformulated in a way to prioritize efficiency in the update step.This PDF gives a concise overview:[1] http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws13/mapping/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time that one comes up, this one comes up https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Pyt...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and advocates for its support across various platforms. The author expresses concerns about the decline of RSS use due to the rise of social media and other content delivery methods, highlighting the advantages of RSS, such as user control over content consumption and the ability to follow multiple sources in one place.

Looking into the XML, it turns out it's called xml-stylesheet:    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="assets/xml/rss.xsl" media="all"?&gt;

And I would argue that this is an excellent way to introduce new readers to RSS: instead of the browser popping up a download prompt, you can make your RSS feeds themselves a dedicated page for advocating RSS, in case an interested reader is browsing through the links on your site.[0] https://getnikola.com/[1] https://getnikola.com/rss.xml (Open it in your browser!)[2] https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/blob/master/nikola/data/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently added RSS to my personal site (https://www.tyleo.com/)Even with a custom implementation it’s a simple thing to support. You can find the whole spec here: https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specificationI’ll mention that there is a competing Atom specification which is compatible with all notable RSS readers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard). The POV I’ve seen on HN favors Atom because it offers more functionality and is a clearer standard.I want to voice my support for RSS though based on its simplicity. To me the feed doesn’t need a bunch of bells and whistles. I get analysis paralysis I get deciding which Atom features to support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42746222</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recursive division algorithm used for generating mazes. It outlines the process by starting with a simple area and recursively dividing it into smaller sections by creating walls, ensuring that passageways are maintained between the divisions. The author explains the steps of the algorithm in detail, including how to determine where to place walls and how to create openings for paths. The narrative emphasizes how this method can create interesting and complex maze structures through systematic division. Additionally, visual examples illustrate the algorithm's results, making it clear how the technique produces varied maze configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite maze algorithm is this one: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/papers-fcpcg/presentation/sli...Live demo at: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/hydrodendron/It allows generating an infinite maze looking at any arbitrary area of the maze, without any loops, using fractal coordinates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remarkably simple with great results. I recommend checking out the author’s book Mazes for Programmers: one of the best programming books I’ve ever read. Incredibly clearly explained, and very interesting, which is an excellent combination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me a little of Hilbert curves.It would be kind of cool to generate an 'infinite' maze this way by starting the process and only recursing to max depth only for the nodes closest to the exits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42703816</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) released a statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold a ban on TikTok, expressing concern over the implications for free speech and digital privacy. The EFF argues that the ban sets a precedent that could endanger other social media platforms and restrict the rights of users to access content and communicate freely. They emphasize the need for transparency and accountability in governmental actions that impact technology and communication tools, calling for a critical examination of the motivations behind such bans.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the end, it's a security and sovereignty issue.  A country can restrict foreign business, full stop.That said, I don't think banning tiktok will have the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Shutting down communications platforms or forcing their reorganization based on concerns of foreign propaganda and anti-national manipulation is an eminently anti-democratic tactic, one that the US has previously condemned globally.These platforms are fundamentally anti-democratic in their very nature, increasingly so in the age of LLMs. They're places where people buy a voice and the illusion of support by astroturfing the platform and/or manipulating the algorithm (either through paid advertisements or by owning a platform and controlling the algorithm outright). They're places where a small minority of people can become an unstoppable movement that seems to have real support, sucking gullible voters in to join the growing "consensus".In short, these platforms are places for manufacturing consent. The only sense in which banning one is anti-democratic is that it's selectively applied to tiktok instead of to all such platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A former sausage maker here.  I (used to) design these engagement/recommendation engines for a large corp, did academic research in the field, went to conferences, etc.In general, I wholehearted support the freedom of speech, and if it were any other case, I would agree with the EFF statement here.  However, knowing how the sausages are made, I am reluctantly agreeing with the ban, at least for now.People underestimate how powerful these tools can be.  Based on simple, readily available "anonymous" data, we can already impute your demographics data -- age, gender, family relations, occupation, income, etc -- using a decade-old ML techniques.  In some cases, we can detect which stage of your emotional journey you are in and nudge you towards our target state.  What surprised me about Cambridge Analytica was its ineffectiveness, at least as reported.  There are plenty of teams out there that use these techniques to greatly further their gains, whatever those may be.In Primakov doctrine, information warfare through sowing discontent and/or eroding psychological well-being is very much real and actualizable.  I am not claiming that a foreign government is currently single-handedly controlling TikTok to brainwash the American youth; we do not have conclusive proof of that.  However, the fact that such a tool is in a foreign country's arsenal is itself a massive danger to America's national security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744695</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a common issue with managing BitLocker encryption on Windows devices when a recovery key is needed, particularly when a user has lost access to the PIN or password. It highlights the importance of having backups of recovery keys and provides tips on how to retrieve them from different sources, such as Microsoft accounts or Active Directory. The piece emphasizes the potential risks and complications of being locked out of a device and encourages users to be proactive in managing their encryption settings to avoid being "screwed without a screwdriver."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t understand this design. You should derive the disk’s encryption key from the user’s login password. You have a small, secure program that presents a login screen on boot. It takes the password you input and uses it to unlock the disk. It passes the username and password along to the OS so that it can take you right into your account after it boots.As long as your encryption is decent, this makes it fundamentally impossible to read the drive from a turned-off state without knowing or cracking the password.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we know how to edit a BCD file. But what do we put in there? This was the trickiest part of this exploit chain, as you get very little feedback when things go wrong. Recall the bug we are trying to reproduce: We want the bootloader to attempt to boot from our BitLocker partition, fail, and then trigger a PXE soft reboot into our controlled OS.&gt; The easiest way to get this working has three parts:&gt; Get the original BCD from the victim’s device. This ensures the configuration matches the specific partition GUIDs. You can do that by shift-rebooting Windows, going “Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt”, mounting the boot partition, and copying its contents to a USB drive. Or, be more advanced and use an SMB mount, if you don’t have USB access.Do I understand it correctly that to bypass the encryption you need access to the decrypted contents of the encrypted disk? Did the original exploit guess the layout of the partitions instead?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all correct, but it’s been fairly well known since over 15 years ago that BitLocker only really protects a computer if you configure BitLocker to require a pre-boot password, and also only after you turned off the computer [0].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker#TPM_alone_is_not_eno...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747877</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Outside the boat, Sarah, Hissora and the others who had jumped off eventually found the two life rafts, which had deployed after the sinking. As they clambered on board, they saw the boat's captain and a number of other crew members were already there.&gt; "There should be some supplies in here," Sarah remembers one of the other guests saying. All the people we spoke to recall a safety briefing mentioning that the life rafts had food and water in them - but they did not, the BBC were told.&gt; "We found a torch, but again it didn't have any batteries. We didn't have any water or any food," Sarah says. "There were flares, but they had already been used."&gt; Sarah also says of the three blankets on board the raft, one had been taken by the captain for himself, leaving one for the rest of the crew and another for the guests. "We ripped it up and huddled together," says Sarah.Absolutely disgraceful behavior from the captain here. This is not a person who should be entrusted with a houseplant, let alone the wellbeing of any number of people on board that vessel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of this older story, of Harrison Okene, who was trapped in a capsized boat at the bottom of the ocean for 3 days: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/26/i-survi...video of his rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um1ym9u8XaARandomly, the next year, he rescued his friend when their car goes off a bridge into water. He later became a diver!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After several hours trapped in the air pocket, the dive guide, Youssef, wanted to try to swim through the boat, but Lucianna and Christophe persuaded him not to. "Stay with us because they are going to come to get our bodies, so they will find us," Lucianna recalls telling him.An odd decision, I would have thought he was a good diver, so presumeably also a decent free diver, knew the boat well, could alert rescuers to the trapped people, and would not use up oxygen when gone from the bubble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42707660</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The project "llmpeg" is an open-source library designed to provide a lightweight implementation of the FFmpeg multimedia framework, focusing on simplicity and ease of use for developers. It enables the manipulation and handling of audio and video files through a straightforward API, allowing for tasks such as encoding, decoding, and streaming multimedia content. The repository includes detailed documentation, examples, and installation instructions to help users get started with integrating multimedia functionalities into their applications efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FFMpeg is one of those tools that is really quite hard to use. The sheer surface area of the possible commands and options is incredible and then there is so much arcane knowledge around the right settings. Its defaults aren't very good and lead to poor quality output in a lot of cases and you can get some really weird errors when you combine certain settings. Its an amazingly capable tool but its equipped with every foot gun going.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good that you have a "read" statement to force confirmation by the user of the command, but all it takes is one errant accidental enter to end up running arbitrary code returned from the LLM.I'd constrain the tool to only run "ffmpeg" and extract the options/parameters from the LLM instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i think this type of interaction is the future in lots of areas. i can imagine we replace API's completely with a single endpoint where you hit it up with a description of what you want back. like, hit up 'news.ycombinator.com/api' with "give me all the highest rated submissions over the past week about LLMs". a server side LLM translates that to SQL, executes the query, returns the results.this approach is broadly applicable to lots of domains just like FFMpeg. very very cool to see things moving in this direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42706637</guid></item><item><title>20.

Sokobon itself is three lines of code in this and many other games only need to add one or two more. Its genius. https://www.puzzlescript.net/My goal rn as an art project is to try to combine the two, so every puzzlescript game can be queried for interesting properties in Dusa / Potasscio / Some Logic Language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748534</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Intel's introduction of its new E-Cores as part of the Skymont architecture, which aims to enhance performance and efficiency in processing tasks. It highlights the advancements in technology that enable these cores to improve multitasking capabilities, reduce power consumption, and provide a competitive edge against rival processors. The piece emphasizes the strategic goals behind the development of E-Cores and their potential impact on the future of computing and gaming performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triple decoder is one unique effect. The fact that Intel managed to get them lined up for small loops to do 9x effective instruction issue is basically miraculous IMO. Very well done.Another unique effect is L2 shared between 4 cores. This means that thread communications across those 4 cores has much lower latencies.I've had lots of debates with people online about this design vs Hyperthreading. It seems like the overall discovery from Intel is that highly threaded tasks use less resources (cache, ROPs, etc. etc).Big cores (P cores or AMD Zen5) obviously can split into 2 hyperthread, but what if that division is still too big? E cores are 4 threads of support in roughly the same space as 1 Pcore.This is because L2 cache is shared/consolidated, and other resources (ROP buffers, register files, etc. etc.) are just all so much smaller on the Ecore.It's an interesting design. I'd still think that growing the cores to 4way SMT (like Xeon Phi) or 8way SMT (POWER10) would be a more conventional way to split up resources though. But obviously I don't work at Intel or can make these kinds of decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel advertising the fact that their schedulers can keep MS Teams confined to the efficiency cores... what a sad reflection of how bloated Teams is.We make a single Electron-like app grow, cancer-like, to do everything from messaging and videoconferencing to shared drive browsing and editing, and as a result we have to contain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off topic, but if I'm aiming to get the fastest 'make -jN' for some random C project (such as the kernel) should I set N = #P [threads] + #E, or just the #P, or something else?  Basically, is there a case where using the E cores slows a compile down?  Or is power management a factor?I timed it on the single Intel machine I have access to with E-cores and setting N = #P + #E was in fact the fastest, but I wonder if that's a general rule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750734</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of identity, emphasizing its complexity and multifaceted nature. It explores how identity is shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural influences, and societal expectations. The author reflects on the continuous evolution of identity throughout one’s life and the importance of self-discovery and authenticity in understanding oneself. Additionally, it highlights the role of digital life in shaping contemporary identities, suggesting that online presence can significantly influence personal and social identities. Overall, the piece encourages readers to engage in thoughtful reflection about their own identities and the factors that contribute to them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the domain name identity model used by AT (so much so I built handles.net[1] for managing domain name based handles) but during my time reading opinions on Bluesky it has become apparent there's a lot more confusion about and distrust towards domain names amongst non-technical people than I previously thought.I thought that people generally understood that domain names are owned and that their provenance can be independently verified (which is why they're valuable for identity) but there's a fairly large and vocal contingent of Bluesky users that are frustrated by domain names, so much so there are multiple efforts to establish a private verification system on Bluesky like verified.quest[2].A lot of people do not want to look at and understand domain names, instead they want to see a name and a check mark. They want a central authority to tell them who is trustworthy and who is not. Domain names are a great solution for technology-adjacent people and I hope that they become more widely accepted, but I'm not too optimistic.I am optimistic and hopeful that AT has a bright future ahead of it. I think AT has a lot going for it... but I do not think that identity will be a part of that. I suspect many apps built on AT will not bother with handles and will just use local display names.[1] https://handles.net
[2] https://verified.quest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Ownership of identityThis isn't currently a reality with ATProto, though they're making important progress over the status quo.Your identity in atproto is your DID. Your domain (if you use one) is just a handle. Currently all DID resolution goes through https://plc.directory, which is completely controlled by Bluesky. Their plan is to eventually have this run more like the DNS by something like a nonprofit, but AFAIK that process hasn't started.The question is if Bluesky turned completely evil today, what recourse would users and app developers have?All the other apps could form a coop for a new DID directory and switch their users over. That might work, but I would like to see something like this in place running alongside Bluesky's directory since the logistics of running such a thing are not obvious.Also, it's not entirely clear to me that running an alternative pseudo-DNS is really better than just using DNS like the fediverse does.One really nice thing about it is that DIDs are opaque values, so squatting should essentially go away. And there's not really any good reason for DIDs to expire like domains do. This is nice for account recovert, since in the worst case if you couldn't prove your identity to the DID registrar your account would just go stale, rather than potentially being taken over by a bad actor[0].[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699099&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ATProto is an interesting technology but the Bluesky app itself is seriously flawed as a Twitter/X competitor.Probably the worst feature is the "nuclear block" which allows a single user to completely disrupt a conversation: if one user blocks any other user in the thread, this removes the blocked user's replies for everyone else reading the thread, and severs the connection between posts so that even if you go directly to a post from the blocked user  you can't see what post they were replying to or any of the rest of the thread above that.There are partial workarounds to this with third-party websites that attempt to piece together the thread from various other API calls, but these aren't perfect and it's annoying to have to do this to understand the context of a conversation full of blocked posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748101</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;BorrowChecker.jl is a Julia package designed to provide borrow checking functionality similar to that found in the Rust programming language. The package aims to help developers manage memory safely by enforcing rules that prevent data races and ensure safe access to mutable state. It incorporates a formal system to check variable borrowing at compile time, aiming to catch potential issues early in the development process. The repository includes documentation for installation and usage, examples of its application, and guidelines for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its a cute idea but, why does a GC language need this? For shared mutable references across threads I get it for some data race conditions? Can it handle that with awareness of smart pointers, etc?Honestly, I'd write Rust. Or write Julia. Whatever one you want.Kudos on the project though, looks like it was fun to make. Who knows maybe it will evolve into something else that makes more sense to me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This package demonstrates Rust-like ownership and borrowing semantics in Julia through a macro-based system that performs runtime checks. This tool is mainly to be used in development and testing to flag memory safety issues, and help you design safer code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool! I wanted to try implement this idea years ago…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750954</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses TCL's Nxtpaper screen technology, which aims to improve the visual experience on digital devices by using a matte display that mimics the appearance of paper. It highlights the technology's features, such as reduced glare, better eye comfort, and the ability to reflect ambient light, making it more readable in bright conditions. The piece also explores potential applications of Nxtpaper in tablets and other devices, emphasizing its importance in enhancing user interaction and reducing digital eye strain compared to traditional glossy screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that individual use of artificial intelligence (AI) isn't inherently detrimental to society, countering the notion that personal AI applications lead to negative societal impacts. It explores how individual engagement with AI can foster innovation, improve productivity, and contribute to personal and professional development. The author emphasizes that the responsible use of AI technology—rather than its mere existence—determines its effects on society, advocating for a balanced perspective on individual AI practices while acknowledging the need for ethical considerations and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One miss in this post is that the author tries to make their point by comparing energy consumption of LLMs to arbitrary points of reference. We should be comparing them to their relevant parallels.Comparing a ChatGPT query to an hour long Zoom call isn't useful. The call might take up ~1700 mL of water, but that is still wildly more efficient than what we used to do prior - travel/commute to meet in person. The "10x a Google search" point is relevant because for many of the use cases mentioned in this post and others like it (e.g. "try asking factual questions!"), you could just as easily get that with 1 Google search and skimming the results.I have found use for LLMs in software development, but I'd be lying if I said I couldn't live without it. Almost every use case of an LLM has a simple alternative - often just employing critical thinking or learning a new skill.It feels like this post is a long way of saying "yes, there are negative impacts, but I value my time more".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet we also see that hyperscale cloud emissions targets have been reversed due to AI investment, Datacenter growth is hitting grid capacity limits in many regions, and peaker plant and other non-renewable resources on the grid are being deployed more to handle this specific growth from AI.  I think the author, by qualifying on "chatgpt" maybe can make the claims they are making but I don't believe the larger argument would hold for AI as a whole or when you convert the electricity use to emissions.I'm personally on the side that the ROI will probably work out in the long run but not by minimizing the potential impact and keeping the focus on how we can make this technology (currently in its infancy) more efficient.
[edit wording]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great article for discussion.  However articles like this must link to references.  It is one thing to assert, another to prove.  I do agree that heating/cooling, car and transport use, and diet play massive roles in climate change that should not be subsumed by other debates.The flip side to the authors argument is that LLMs are not only used by home users doing 20 searches a day.  Governments and Mega-Corporations are chewing through GPU hours on god-knows-what.  New nuclear and other power facilities are being proposed to power their use, this is not insignificant. Schneider Electric predicts 93 GW of energy spent on AI by 2028. https://www.powerelectronicsnews.com/schneider-electric-pred...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745847</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Hilbert curves, a type of space-filling curve that can cover a two-dimensional area entirely without any gaps or overlaps. It explores the mathematical properties of these curves, including their recursive construction and the concept of mapping one-dimensional data to two-dimensional spaces. The text also highlights potential applications of Hilbert curves, such as in image processing and data visualization, and provides visual examples to illustrate how these curves behave and their implications in various fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For want of a better term, I've called this Zigzag order.I learned this has a technical name: the zigzag order is called “Boustrophedonic”, after the Ancient Greek tablets where they wrote right-to-left on one line, then left-to-right on the next. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoustrophedonIt totally depends on the specifics of your application, but a little while ago, I compared Hilbert to both Boustrophedonic and Morton order, and surprisingly, Boustrophedonic was the winner. My application was partitioning a 3d grid into blocks of active voxels where each block could be represented efficiently with only a range (pair) of indices. It’s surprising at first that the zig-zag sometimes has better locality than Hilbert or Morton.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun article, but the example of Hilbert Curve usefulness with hard drives is quickly aging out. SSDs, which are increasingly prevalent, have more-or-less constant access time. There is no equivalent of the seek time or rotational latency that slows down HHD access when successive reads are on different tracks, at different rotational angles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilbert curves are used in modern data lakehouse storage optimisation techniques, such as Databricks' "liquid clustering" [1]. This can replace the need for more traditional "hive-style" partitioning, in which the data files are partitioned based on a folder structure (e.g. `mydatafiles/YYYY/MM/DD/`).1. https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744932</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sometimes chuckle that most of the cool Lexuses are now Priuses under the hood!But that’s a good thing. I own a Toyota Corolla hybrid myself, and hybrids are one of those things that I can say I’ve completely changed my mind about. I used to dislike the idea of hybrids, because I assumed that the overall system complexity must be higher than either an ICE, or an EV. And I’m a sucker for simple systems, so I thought it’s either EV, or nothing.Then I looked into how hybrids work. Specifically Toyota hybrids. And came away totally amazed. It’s an amazing system, and much simpler than a traditional ICE car. It doesn’t really have a gearbox, or a clutch, or a starter. The engine is a normal atmospheric engine, so no turbines, overcompression, and the issues that come with it. Furthermore, the engine is typically configured to use the Atkinson cycle, which puts less stress on it. And, the engine has a chain drive, so no belts to change, and by design gets stressed a lot less than in a traditional ICE, because the stop-start load is carried by the electric motor. Also, it can’t really have trouble starting in cold weather, much like an EV. All of that boils down to crazy reliability.I’m at a point where if I’m looking for a car that uses fuel, it’s only cars that use the Toyota hybrid tech (or similar) that I’m looking at. At the moment it’s just Toyota, Lexus, most Ford hybrids (but not all).Other companies have hybrids that are liable to my original concerns about massively increased complexity. As an example, VW hybrids have an electric motor within their DSG gearbox. So you have all the complexity of their modern  ICEs (turbines, DSG, whatnot) plus additional hybrid related complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new Prius is really good-looking (to my eye at least), especially in person: I don't think the photos (I've seen) do it justice. Fun comparisons to the car  Burt Reynolds drove in Smokey and the Bandit: Compared to the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am:   - The Prius is as fast 0-60 (~7 seconds)
   - The Prius has nearly the same top speed (~115 mph)
   - The Prius is 4x(!) as fuel-efficient (57mpg vs. 12-16mpg)
   - The Prius has all the modern stuff: air conditioning, antilock brakes, airbags, crumple zones, information display screen, backup camera, proximity alerts, etc. etc.
   - Adjusted for inflation, the Prius costs almost exactly the same&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love my Prius. What amazes me about the car is how “idiot-proof” or “smart” it is. I try my best to hypermile and squeeze out every last MPG, while my wife doesn’t make any effort to baby it—and yet, we both consistently get about 57 MPG combined. The car adapts to how you drive it, which is really impressive.I think Toyota deserves as much credit as Apple for its “it just works” ethos. The way they design the technology to be seamless and work so well behind the scenes is remarkable. Additionally, many Toyota mechanics consider the Prius to be the most reliable car Toyota makes. This often surprises people because of the perceived complexity of hybrids, but in reality, they are elegantly engineered and surprisingly simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747899</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to improving network security by introducing a new method for securely executing processes without relying on traditional operating system features that are vulnerable to exploitation. It highlights a specific security technique called "flight," which allows code execution in a protected environment, mitigating risks associated with memory corruption and similar attacks. The author emphasizes the importance of developing more robust systems that prioritize security in contemporary computing environments, showcasing the potential benefits of this innovative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

But key agreement doesn't tell the parties why they should trust each other; you need signatures and certificates for that, and those will need to be PQ-ready too.That part is much harder, for both technical (larger certificates implied by most PQ signing schemes are much harder to reliably convey over packet networks) and political (the X.509 ecosystem moves very slowly, and penetration of new signature schemes takes years) reasons.[1]: Nothing about it is easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Scott Aaronson talk he links at the bottom[1], Prof. Aaronson says&gt; A fourth reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself... Or they say things like, “complex Hilbert space in 2^n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality”—the kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.How is that a failure to take intellectual responsibility?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the relevance of traditional natural language processing (NLP) in the current landscape dominated by deep learning models. It explores how advancements like transformer architecture and large language models (LLMs) have shifted the focus away from classical techniques. However, the author argues that traditional NLP approaches still possess value, particularly for specific tasks and applications where they can be more efficient and interpretable than complex models. The piece emphasizes a balanced view, suggesting that both traditional and modern methods can coexist and complement each other in the evolving field of NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No, it has not and will not in the foreseeable future. This is one of my responsibilities at work. LLMs are not feasible when you have a dataset of 10 million items that you need to classify relatively fast and at a reasonable cost. LLMs are great at mid-level complexity tasks given a reasonable volume of data - they can take away the tedious job of figuring out what you are looking at or even come up with some basic mapping. But anything at large volumes.. Na. Real life example: "is '20 bottles of ferric chloride' a service or a product?"One prompt? Fair. 10? Still ok. 100? You're pushing it. 10M - get help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For my use case, definitely.I have worked on AWS Connect (online call center) and Amazon Lex (the backing NLP engine) projects.Before LLMs, it was a tedious process of trying to figure out all of the different “utterances” that people could say and the various languages you had to support.  With LLMs, it’s just promptinghttps://chatgpt.com/share/678bab08-f3a0-8010-82e0-32cff9c0b4...I used something like this using Amazon Bedrock and a Lambda hook for Amazon Lex.  Of course it wasn’t booking a flight. It was another systemThe above is a simplified version.  In the real world , I gave it a list of intents (book flights, reserve a room, rent a car) and properties - “slots” - I needed for each intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question seems malformed to me.Text classification, clustering, named entity recognition, etc. are NLP tasks.  LLMs can perform these tasks.  ML models that are not LLMs (or even not deep learning models) can also perform these tasks.  Is the author perhaps asking if the concept of a "completion" has replaced all of these tasks?When I hear "traditional NLP" I think not of the above types of tasks but rather the methodology employed for performing them.  For example, building a pipeline to do stemming/lemmatization, part of speech tagging, coreference resolution, etc. before the text gets fed to a classifier model.  This was SOTA 10 years ago but I don't think many people are still doing it today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708291</guid></item><item><title>33.

So either this should be "... unless there was no other option", or I'm completely misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the way the system is rigged to the wall of the station is quite humorous to me in how it is taking full advantage of being weightless. From the arm the camera is attached to the tracker, and then the tracker being mounted to the one arm just seems like it would collapse on itself if it were on terra firma.I've seen some crazy/shitty rigging done, but this one gets a pass because it's in spaaaaaaaace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat.Debbie Downer: Looks like it fairly easily could have been made with like 50% less mass.Perhaps that wouldn't have mattered though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42701645</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses post-timing attacks, which are a form of side-channel attack that exploit the timing information associated with cryptographic operations. It explains how these attacks can leak sensitive information by measuring the time it takes to execute certain operations, particularly in systems using cryptographic algorithms. The article highlights various methods of mitigation to protect against such timing attacks, including constant-time implementations and other countermeasures. It emphasizes the importance of secure coding practices and raises awareness about the risks posed by timing discrepancies in cryptographic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A note on the Thompson sampling: classic TS is optimizing for regret, while the goal here is to identify the 'best arm' (ie. the actual secret value at that position - it's like a 0/1 loss). There is no partial credit in getting part of a password correct, it still won't work. So it's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit#Best_Arm_Id...You can tweak the Thompson sampling to handle best-arm, like https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publica... "Ordered-Statistic Thompson Sampling". I am not sure if the pseudocode TS presented by OP winds up doing the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the author:
"Benchmarking page to choose good parameters..." seems to spin forever and I don't feel the device getting warm. Don't have an error console on mobile so not sure what's up but this is on an Android webview browser. Maybe add an onerror event handler to at least show the user this spinner is going nowhere?Edit: wait, it did complete now that I've not used the skip to demo link and read the article. "Benchmark complete! Using 29000 iterations". Maybe mention that it can take several minutes on a modern device? Or a progress indicator?Now that I'm running the password guesser, the device does get warm in the usual spot for cpu load. Cool way to visualise the method! After five minutes, 6 out of 10 guesses have the right first character, and of those, 2 the right second character. Am I extrapolating correctly if I guess it'll need to do this 4 more times so some 20 minutes? Battery use is 30%./hour currently so about 10% of a full charge would be 1.1 WhEdit2: the number of correct prefixes is decreasing after 10~15 minutes. This will take forever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of timing side channel attacks in general. With VUSEC (VU University Amsterdam) we did flush/reload side channel attacks. I don't remember the specifics, I did this in 2018.But yea, basically if a cache hit versus a memory roundtrip will result in different time values, then you can iterate over all 256 bytes (assuming ASCII) and when you have a cache hit for a specific value, the time should be much lower.However, this also assumes you understand cache internals of the specific CPU and it means you need to know when caches fill up, why they fill up and how to do cache eviction. Knowing how to do cache eviction means that you need to know how many elements can be cached, and if I recall correctly that means you need to reverse engineer the cache size of the CPU. But once you can reliable evict values from the cache set and reliably fill them up, then the rough outline I mentioned above is possible.Again, this is like 50% accurate since it has been a long while and I currently work in marketing as a data analyst (I like a mix of fluffy marketing/psychology talk and being deeply technical - if you feel the same way, feel free to reach out. My email is on my profile). There's some of what I described on this website (and a whole bunch more) [1]. I think the reverse engineering of cache lines was specifically in the accompanied paper.[1] https://www.vusec.net/projects/glitch/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708212</guid></item><item><title>35.

There's the 'we wanted to do this thing but you're already doing it' merge. There's the 'let's be a monopoly!' merge, and its sibling, 'you are getting in the way of my aspirations to be a monopoly' merge. There's the quiet merge to deal with debts, the making-it-formal-but-functionally-we-were-already-merged, the hey-that-collaboration-went-well merge, and many more.And then there's this merge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perplexity sounds desperate.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at a worker-owned IT company that has offices in three states and has been in existence for 20 years. We do not provide any kind of SaaS service but I can assure you it is possible! My suggestion is to reach out to the Tech Worker Coop Peer Network for the USFWC:https://www.usworker.coop/programs/peer-networks/They will probably have ideas. 
Good luck!PS an LLC is definitely a good way to go, but some states (e.g. NY, MA, CA, MN, etc) have dedicated worker coop company types you can create.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might be interested in Subvert, a group of people (formerly?) from Bandcamp that are now founding a worker-/artist-owned version of Bandcamp and launching the platform soon. They basically want to avoid running into the same issues that came with Bandcamp’s recent ownership changes and the instability and worker-facing hostilities around it.They also published a magazine explaining their thinking behind the setup, etc. – you can find out more on their website: https://subvert.fm/Could be interesting to check out, even if just for inspiration or fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I established a limited liability company (LLC) for a business venture initiated with friends. My objective was to ensure that all contributors received a fair share of the equity while maintaining a simplified structure for tax purposes. Additionally, I wanted to ensure that equity shares did not confer voting rights, functioning instead as profit-sharing interests. Legal counsel assisted in structuring the entity as a single-member LLC, where I am the sole owner, with profit-sharing units allocated to other contributors. This arrangement entitles contributors to a defined percentage of the company’s profits and proceeds from events such as a sale of the company.My only regret is that I spent a lot of money on legal fees and the company ended up not being profitable so a lot of the work went to waste. But now I can re-use the structure again if I wish to create a new venture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748394</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Generative Adversarial Nets" presents a novel framework for training generative models using a process involving two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity against real data samples. This adversarial process leads to improved performance in generating high-quality data, with applications in various domains including image generation and unsupervised learning. The authors describe the mathematical foundations and empirical results of their model, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing realistic data distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google announced a significant change to its search engine by requiring websites to support JavaScript to be indexed effectively. This move aims to enhance the user experience by ensuring that dynamic content, which relies on JavaScript for rendering, is fully accessible in search results. Webmasters and developers are encouraged to adapt their sites accordingly to maintain visibility on Google Search, as failure to comply could lead to reduced indexing of their web pages. The article discusses the implications of this requirement for the web development community and highlights the importance of optimizing websites for both performance and searchability.&lt;/p&gt;

The rest are from bots, and not like people who haven't found I have an API, but bots that are attempting to poison Google or Bing's query suggestions (even though I'm not backed by either).  From what I've heard from other people running search engines, it looks the same everywhere.I don't know what Google's ratio of human to botspam is, but given how much of a payday it would be if anyone were to succeed, I can imagine they're serving their fair number of automated requests.Requiring a headless browser to automate the traffic makes the abuse significantly more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tested (ignoring AI search engines, non-english, non-free):Search engines which require JavaScript:Google, Bing, Ecosia, Yandex, Qwant, Gibiru, Presearch, Seekr, Swisscows, Yep, Openverse, Dogpile, WaldoSearch engines which do not require JavaScript:DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Search, Brave Search, Startpage, AOL Search, giveWater, Mojeek&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've put off learning JavaScript for over 20 years, now I'm not going to be able to search for anything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747092</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emulation of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) using finite element methods. It explores the challenges and methodologies involved in replicating GPU functionalities within a CPU environment, aiming to enhance computing efficiency for specific tasks commonly handled by GPUs. The author presents theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, highlighting the potential benefits and performance metrics of this approach. Additionally, the article emphasizes the applicability of this emulation in various computational fields, proposing it as a viable alternative when GPU resources are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction : 
Finite Field Assembly is a programming language that lets you emulate GPUs on CPUsIt's a CUDA alternative that uses finite field theory to convert GPU kernels to prime number fields.Finite Field is the primary data structure : FF-asm is a CUDA alternative designed for computations over finite fields.Recursive computing support : not cache-aware vectorization, not parallelization, but performing a calculation inside a calculation inside another calculation.Extension of C89 - runs everywhere gcc is available.
Context : I'm getting my math PhD and I built this language around my area of expertise, Number Theory and Finite Fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I get it. You're using the Ring isomorphism from the Chinese Remainder Theorem to do "parallel computation". This is the same principle as how boolean algebra on binary strings computes the pairwise results of each bit in parallel. Unfortunately, there's no free lunch - if you want to perform K operations on N-bit integers in parallel, you still need to work with (K * N)-bit-wide vectors, which is essentially what SIMD does anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the more subtle aspects of retargeting GPU code to run on the CPU is the presence of fine grained(read - block level and warp level) explicit synchronization mechanisms being available in the GPU. However, this is not the same in CPU land, so additional care has to be taken to handle this. One example of work which tries this is https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00257 .Interestingly, in the same work, contrary to what you’d expect, transpiling GPU code to run on CPU gives ~76% speedups in HPC workloads compared to a hand optimized multi-core CPU implementation on Fugaku(a CPU only supercomputer), after accounting for these differences in synchronization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695414</guid></item><item><title>41.

It is great for solving the kinds of math, coding and logic puzzles it has been designed for, but for many kinds of tasks, including chat and creative writing, it is actually worse than 4o. It is good at the specific kinds of reasoning tasks that it was built for, much like alpha-go is great at playing go, but that does not actually mean it is more generally intelligent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of luck using 4o to build and iterate on context and then carry that into o1. I’ll ask 4o to break down concepts, make outlines, identify missing information and think of more angles and options. Then at the end, switch on o1 which can use all that context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750096</guid></item><item><title>42.

Sadly, it was meant to only print text, and having a fancy typewriter definitely wasn't very much fun to me. Somehow, I figured out that the printer actually supported defining custom fonts! After some reverse-engineering of the format I ended up with a program to slice the screen into rectangles matching printer's letter sizes (which were not 8x8 pixels, to make it extra fun) and sending them as custom font definition for each symbol of the alphabet, then printing "ABCD..."Getting a paper printout of loading screens or in-game screenshot art was mind-blowing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why’s the Spectrum’s screen layout different from, say, a C64? The explanation on the page sounds a lot like the 64’s.(Not trying to sound snarky, but curious.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the implications of a potential TikTok ban in the United States, questioning whether such a move could lead to a broader re-evaluation of internet governance and the digital landscape. It discusses concerns about privacy, national security, and the influence of large tech companies while highlighting the complexities of regulating social media platforms. The author argues that rather than simply banning individual apps, there is an opportunity to rethink the structure and principles that underpin the internet as a whole, fostering a more secure and equitable digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course it's a chance to rethink the internet. COVID was also a chance to rethink our responses to pandemics. Cambridge Analytica was a chance to rethink data privacy as it relates to private companies. Edward Snowden was a chance to rethink data privacy as it relates to governments. Climate Change is a chance to rethink how we live our lives, build our cities, and produce our food. In my hometown, an earthquake was a chance to rethink how the city worked.Life is full of these chances, but we seldom take them. Whatever happens with TikTok, it'll be business as usual in no time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting trend I've noticed: Tiktok's users tend to like its algorithm, and its probably the app's most valuable assets, but western tech executives tend to hate it and speak of it with derision.This stands in stark contrast with US-based social media companies, where both its users and content creators often speak like they're at war with the algorithm, yet to the tech elite these sites algorithms are tuned to perfection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RSS was too good and too decentralized to exist. It's a miracle that it's still possible to independently publish and subscribe to podcasts (notably, Spotify doesn't let you subscribe to unapproved podcasts).I social web based on RSS would be heaven: publish anywhere you want, own your content and URL, no content moderation, pick your own service (separately) for discovery. Google should be pushing harder for this to bust content back out of the walled gardens of Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745082</guid></item><item><title>44.

Strangers machines that you trust enough to connect to your servers, and are able to install putty or your preferred ssh client of choice on? Better just have SSH on your own phone and laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745876</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only given it a skim read so far but this looks like a really nice write up and it's a fantastic piece of work. Laser fault injection is a very powerful attack so great to see it becoming more accessible through work like this (or terrible if you're someone relying on security of hardware that considers LFI to be a highly advanced technique that it doesn't need to defend against...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much more complicated than the Cullen's hack at CCC, but I think that also required a bit of luck. This was an very interesting read in terms of solid research experimentation setup. We now have two really nice attacks on the RP2350 secure boot, and only a few months after release.The Cullen observation that the OTP power supply wasn't being glitch detected was pretty damning and a much more devastating attack in practice. If you require decapping and lasers, anything is possible.Thanks for the write-up!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related but could this setup be used for laser micro drilling? I've been wondering if there are ways to do it quick and dirty by brute forcing the reality with the fact that the year is 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708682</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Path of Our Lives" by Steve Blank discusses the importance of understanding and reflecting on the personal and professional journey individuals take throughout their lives. Blank emphasizes that each person's path is unique and shaped by experiences, challenges, and decisions. He encourages readers to consider how their past influences their current choices and future aspirations. The piece serves as a reminder to be intentional about one's life trajectory and to learn from both successes and failures in order to create a meaningful and fulfilling future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I too have survivorship bias that I try to explain away with self serving theories and ideas that pit my special nature against the tendencies of the inferior masses. In my case I literally survived alcoholism after I was lucky enough to come out alive after an accident. I used this as motivation to do the hard work of getting and staying sober. My brain sometimes tells me that I have some special power of “working hard enough to change myself” that has also helped me become an entrepreneur and make other positive changes in my life. I tell myself people sometimes fail because they didn’t go through this and can’t work hard enough to change themselves for the better. In reality it all comes down to luck and circumstance that I was fortunate enough to take advantage of.In this post the author tries to set up an unassailable scenario where two very similar people end up with strikingly different life outcomes because of “how some of us have chosen to live their lives.” Conveniently, the author is the successful one because he is part of “a small set of humans who don’t act like their lives are predestined.” The majority, and the person he compares himself to, obviously couldn’t succeed without this special character aspect. In reality, it’s the “small set of humans” part that shows the way to the truth. The analysis that says successful people are different because they chose to act differently and not live a “predestined” life ignores all the people who also made that choice without getting lucky and achieving success. It also leaves out the people who lived a “predestined” life and succeeded despite their lack of willpower or special abilities or whatever else we can point to as an explanation.Like I said, I am victim to the same fallacies in my own reasoning about my life, but I try very hard to overcome them or at least recognize them. The takeaway from this article isn’t that “you are the master of your own fate” but instead something like “be careful when trying to explain your own life’s circumstances, especially when your explanations put you in some special class that only few people have achieved.” Luck, by its very nature, is only for the few.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"But what we know with certainty is that there is a small set of humans who don’t act like their lives are predestined. For better or worse, regardless of circumstances, country or culture they struggle their entire lives wanting to change the outcome. And a small percentage of these translate the “wanting to change” into acting on it. This small group is dissatisfied with waiting for life to hand them their path. They act, they do, they move, they change things."Oh! I wish I could live by the storytelling and narrative that this gentleman does!He thinks there is no such thing of a predestined life but he is actually predestined to think that way. And then he blames those who are not predestined and forces them to work in an Amazon warehouse and sleep in their car.Look at his sprawling estate he wants us all to see right there at the top of his blog! His ego!It sounds like his friend Glen is the guy I want to be around, ans Steve seems to think that it might not have been lucky for him that "we were both sent to bases in different parts of the U.S."This is the equation I will leave you with.Success = hard work + LuckLuck is an uncontrolled variable, so success is uncontrollable. If anyone can refute that logic please do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699370</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses TikTok's recent decision to temporarily cease operations in the U.S. due to mounting regulatory scrutiny and security concerns. It highlights the challenges the platform faces amidst increasing pressure from lawmakers about data privacy and its ties to China. The piece notes the potential impact on users and businesses that have come to rely on the app for communication and marketing, while also exploring TikTok's efforts to address these issues with transparency and engagement with U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

TikTok has easily more influence than most TV channels so it does not seem strange to limit its foreign ownership. If the purchase of US steel by a Japanese company threatens national security, surely the ownership of TikTok is also one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A point I think most people don’t understand is that the government interest in TikTok has little to do with exploiting user data per se, a lot of other companies do that. The issue is that TikTok is somewhat unique in being aggressively weaponized in currently very active “grey zone” conflicts.This has been an open secret in national security circles but the average person on the street has no idea what a grey zone conflict is, what it looks like, or why it matters. Geopolitic strategies are increasingly executed as grey zone warfare, and some hybrid warfare, because the costs and risks of traditional overt warfare have become unacceptably high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753396</guid></item><item><title>2.

A fork of Gitea [0] but managed via a non profit, no premium upsells, all freely licensed [1](GPL) etc.Good to see their community outreach is via Matrix and Mastadon. My kind of nerds.Apparently this is what Codeberg is running out, if you click . Looks like gitea/github to me, nothing wrong with that [2] source code is available from the little branch icon in the top right corner, hosted on codeberg which TIL is a forgejo instance [3][0] https://forgejo.org/2024-02-forking-forward/[1] https://forgejo.org/2024-08-gpl/[2] https://v10.next.forgejo.org/explore/repos[3] https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got curious about why Forgejo split off from Gitea, and it seems like yet another case of broke FOSS creators/maintainers getting screwed from above (and maybe below too).From the Gitea incorporation announcement (below), it looks like they couldn't pay their bills as FOSS, and there were wealthy free-riders (which the MIT license allows).&gt; "Over the years we have tried various ways to support maintainers and the project. Some ways we have tried include bounties, direct donations, grants, and a few others. We have found that while there have been many wonderful individuals, and a few corporations who have been incredibly generous, and we are so thankful for their support, there are a few corporations (with revenues that are greater than some countries GDP) are building on Gitea for core products without even contributing back enhancements. [emphasis added]I'm not a fan of Bruce Perens, but he kind of nails the problem when he says:&gt; "We have a great corporate welfare program, our users are the richest companies in the world. Indeed, we've enabled companies like Google to be created.&gt; "In contrast, if our developers aren't working for those companies, they probably go un-compensated."----On the flip side, the community rebelled when the creators formed a company, but not supposedly because they formed a company, but because that co held the domain and trademark. Seems like a small hill to die on to me, but I don't know the details.Regardless, it looks like exhibit #187 of FOSS failing for anyone outside of hobbyists and FAANGs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fedora Project (Linux) is switching to this, FWIW https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-moves-towards-forgejo-a-un...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753523</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of procedural programming within the context of Haskell, a functional programming language. It highlights the differences between procedural and functional programming paradigms, emphasizing how Haskell, despite its functional nature, can still support procedural styles through techniques such as monads and IO actions. The author explores practical implications and examples of writing procedural code in Haskell, aiming to bridge the understanding for programmers coming from a procedural background by demonstrating how Haskell can be employed in a more imperative style when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; and (c) requires a language feature (sequence points) to disambiguate in which order side effects get executed. With Haskell, we just don’t have to care.Reading up to this point, I had to chuckle a bit. I have struggled with the Haskell type system more than I care to admit; It's almost never "we just don't have to care" when comparing to most other popular languages.That being said, this article does a nice job of gently introducing some of the basics that will trip up somebody who is casually looking through code wondering what *&gt; and &lt;*&gt; and &lt;* do. As usual, there is a steep learning curve because of stuff like this all over the codebase. If I walk away for a month, I need to revisit &gt;&gt;= vs &gt;&gt; and other common operators before I can be productive. It probably doesn't help that I never actually speak to a human about these concepts so in my head it's always "&gt;&gt;=" and not "bind."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way I think about effectful computation and IO in Haskell is as a kind of enforced metaprogramming. The actual language comprises a strongly typed meta-layer used to assemble an imperative program from opaque primitives. Like all powerful metaprogramming systems, this allows doing things you cannot easily do in a first-order imperative language. On the other hand, this makes all the 99% of simple stuff you don't have to even think about in an imperative language necessarily roundabout, and imposes a steep learning curve. Which contributes to the empirical fact that not many people are rushing to use Haskell, the superior imperative language, in real-world projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave a talk that goes more into what makes imperative programming better with Haskell compared to traditional imperative languages. https://speakerdeck.com/ajnsit/supercharged-imperative-progr...In a nutshell, first class effects and built in set of patterns for composing them get rid of boilerplate code. Combine that with type safety and you can churn out relatively bug free code very fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42754098</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how the Unix spell-checking program operates efficiently within a constrained memory environment of just 64KB RAM. It provides insights into the design and implementation of the program, highlighting the algorithms and data structures that enable it to function effectively even with limited resources. The author delves into the history and evolution of the program, illustrating how its lightweight nature allows for fast processing and reliable performance in text correction tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can write an external memory spell checker with a tiny amount of RAM:  something like   - sort the words in the document
   - eliminate unique words (they sort together)
   - merge the sorted words with the sorted dictionary and keep only the missing words

I saw this in BASIC in Creative Computing and got it working in on my TRS-80 Color Computer which had much less than 32k of available RAM,  so that was the first thing I thought when I saw the headline.Now this blew people away when it came outhttps://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-lightning/1xit had a compressed dictionary that would fit together with the other programs you were running on a PC and spell check as you typed;  there was a 640k limit for the PC but it could only use a fraction of that so as not to interfere and in the early days of the PC you couldn't actually afford to fill it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; At this time, Bloom filter was not even called Bloom filter. In his paper, Douglas calls it a “superimposed code scheme”.A Bloom filter is a specific type of superimposed code.Calvin Mooers developed random (1) superimposed coding in his Master's thesis at MIT back in the 1940s, directly influenced by Shannon's work.Bourne's superb 1963 book "Methods of Information Handling" gives details of the mathematics.I've no doubt Douglas knew about the broader technique, which, for example, the author of "The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma" (1975) at http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci60001a005 described as "an old technique called super-imposed coding".(1) The "random" is an important qualifier because there were superimposed codes predating Mooers, but they were not mathematically interesting or all that practically important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Way too smart for worse is better. Think Worser!The main memory bandwidth and the disk bandwidth were about the same, a little of 1MB/s.I would have done this in multiple passes (but still used the Bloom Filters, those are cool).https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/v10spellhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/unix-spell/The original paper is great https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Development-of-a-Spell...It is hosted on his web page https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroyIf you are a word nerd, you will have found obovate and there, this chart.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Leaf_mor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752604</guid></item><item><title>5.

It analyzes the implications of these restrictions for fan engagement and media coverage during the tournament, highlighting how such measures could stifle creativity and limit the ways in which the event is presented to the audience.

In the USA, the licensing notices specifically prohibit use of even "the descriptions" that appear in a broadcast.I suppose they'll close that loophole in other countries.The whole regime is a big F-U to fans, and to the taxpayers who subsidize these teams out the wazoo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like watching random sports on YouTube so saw this yesterday. I could only manage a minute, it was just bizarre. It did make me wonder how I could watch the Australia Open, but I wasn't willing to subscribe to ESPN to see it.Not bad advertising really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this harm the long-term value of AOs rights sales to the broadcasters?If I know AO is going to broadcast on youtube, why am I as a European broadcaster going to pay them the same amount as I did when they weren't trying to work against me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42719498</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the public preview of an evolving GitHub Issues experience, which introduces several new features aimed at improving user interaction and project management. Key enhancements include a redesigned user interface, support for customizable templates, better organization of issues through labels and milestones, and improved search functionality. These updates are intended to streamline workflows, facilitate collaboration among users, and ultimately enhance productivity within GitHub projects. The preview invites user feedback to further refine the features before a wider rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 50 trillion of begging Github for a functional notification system so I can stop receiving infinite numbers of emails from all the bots and similar things commenting on PRs.Also being designated a codeowner in a large repo, the number of notifications I get daily from the number of PRs is fucking absurd, with no way of turning them off. Drives me up the wall daily. If a colleague doesn't straight up send me a PR in a DM, I'll basically never see it because I've given up on the notification screen a looooong time ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A GitHub feature I think would be really handy is suggesting duplicate issues when writing up a new issues. Many projects ask that you search for already reported tickets, but GitHub's current search isn't great if you aren't sure what you are looking for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think of GitHub as a sad story. There are probably going to be at least 3 public companies that should have "just" been GitHub features: GitLab (GitHub Enterprise), Sourcegraph (search), and Linear (GitHub Issues). There are dozens of upstarts "unbundling" features of GitHub that are genuinely useful, but which are under-loved and under-invested in, and surely some of those will become successful too. It feels like GitHub continuously invents the future, and then waits for someone else to make it truly great.It is so painful to watch because I love GitHub so much. I graduated college in 2013, which means I started programming right when they got started. I read their dev blog every single day, eagerly waiting for new features (which were released every couple days). I watched their team page grow, I looked carefully at what they did to deserve a spot at such a cool company. I scoured the projects they contributed back to for hints about what good code looked like (my favorite was Vicent Martí's contributions to libgit2). I eagerly taught my friends how to use git because university taught subversion. I wrote my own Rails tutorials as a way to learn the magic.But it's been years now, and it's not an easy love. It's work! It's so painful to watch it get continuously lapped by upstarts. I always just thought the core offerings (Pull Requests and Issues) would get better eventually. And now, 14 years later, they finally are. But very slowly. I really want to believe, but after 16 years, it is starting to sink in that GitHub might just be a place to store files.The magic is still in there. I think there are lots of people like me, who want to believe. But it will take real agency to do it, and that's really hard to muster at this stage in a company's life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725692</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of building a database from scratch in just 3000 lines of code, emphasizing the importance of understanding the fundamentals of database functionality. It outlines the essential components of a database, such as data storage, retrieval, and management, and provides insights into the programming techniques and algorithms that can be employed to create a simple yet effective database system. The author aims to demystify the process and encourage developers to explore database creation as a practical exercise in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

JPEG 2000 lets you zoom in and access higher levels of detail without reading the whole file. Or not zoom in and read a low-rez version from a small part of the file. So it's good for map data.Deep zooming doesn't come up much in web usage, and browsers don't support JPEG 2000.The JPEG 2000 decoder situation isn't good. OpenJPEG is slow and has had several reported vulnerabilities. There are better expensive decoders, and GPUs can be used to help with decoding, but the most popular decoders are slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm amused by how quickly he shifts from "all existing image viewers have silly bugs, no-one knows what they're doing, I want to understand everything" to "here's some code I copy-pasted that seems to work". What a deeply quixotic approach to, uh, everything in this blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From his footnotes:&gt; I was able to find a reasonable amount of AVIF HDR images, but HEIC HDR is nowhere to be found.Anything taken by an iPhone camera is an HDR HEIF image… sort of. For backwards compatibility reasons it's an SDR image with an additional attached image called a gain map that HDRifies it. (This is mathematically worse for a reason I don't remember; it causes any picture taken at a concert with blacklights or blue spotlights to look bad. Once you see this you'll never unsee it.)I believe the very newest Sony cameras can also save HEIF images, however I don't feel like spending $2500 to upgrade my second-to-newest A7 to a newest A7 to find out.Lightroom also recently added HDR editing so maybe it can export them now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42730512</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The Fuzzing Book is a comprehensive resource dedicated to the art and science of fuzz testing, a technique used to identify vulnerabilities in software applications. It provides a thorough introduction to fuzzing concepts, methodologies, and tools, including practical examples and detailed explanations. The content is designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners, covering topics such as input generation, test case creation, and the design of fuzzing engines. Additionally, the book emphasizes hands-on learning with exercises and code samples, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to enhance their software security practices through effective fuzz testing.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the tool/framework/concept that these guys used in the mid to late 90s to fuzz those 2k+ bugs out of Netscape Navigator like they mention in the article. 
Rather ingenious that it's fuzzing technique allowed them to not only isolate bugs without really knowing what behavior triggered it, but it would automatically narrow it down to the specific line of code at fault. I'm not really doing it justice, even less so because I can't remember the name of that tool/framework/technique.... Definitely made me rethink my understanding of how under lying systems architecture and code actually interact, and what a "bug" truly is. 
So anyway, tl;dr, a coincidence happened to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also Fuzzing 101: https://github.com/antonio-morales/Fuzzing101&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756286</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Yek is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to enhance the performance of Python applications by allowing users to run scripts in parallel across multiple CPU cores. It simplifies the process of executing tasks concurrently, helps in improving the efficiency of data processing, and supports easy configuration for various job types. The tool facilitates a streamlined workflow for developers looking to optimize their Python scripts without delving into complex multiprocessing code. The repository provides detailed documentation, examples, and installation instructions for easy integration into existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is where the future of coding is. It is still useful to be a coder, the more experienced the better. But you will not write or edit a lot of lines anymore. You will organize the codebase in a way AI can handle it, make architectural decisions and organize the workflow around AI doing the actual coding.The way I currently do this is that I wrote a small python file that I can start with    llmcode.py /path/to/repo

Which then offers a simple web interface at localhost:8080 where I can select the files to serialize and describe a task.It then creates a prompt like this:    Look at the code files below and do the following:

    {task_description}

    Output all files that you need to change in full again,
    including your changes. In the same format as I provide
    the files below, that means each file starts with
    filename: and ends with :filename
    Under no circumstances output any other text, no additional
    infos, no code formatting chars. Only the code in the
    given format.

    Here are the files:

    somefile.py:
    ...code of somefile.py...
    :somefile.py

    someotherfile.py:
    ...code of someotherfile.py...
    :someotherfile.py

    assets/css/somestyles.css:
    ...code of somestyles.css...
    :assets/css/somestyles.css

    etc

Then llmcode.py sends it to an LLM, parses the output and writes the files back to disk.I then look at the changes via "git diff".It's quite fascinating. I often only make minor changes before accepting the "pull request" the llm made. Sometimes I have to make no changes at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added some benchmarking to show how fast it is:Here is a benchmark comparing it to [Repomix][1] serializing the Next.js project:      time yek
      Executed in    5.19 secs    fish           external
         usr time    2.85 secs   54.00 micros    2.85 secs
         sys time    6.31 secs  629.00 micros    6.31 secs



      time repomix
      Executed in   22.24 mins    fish           external

         sys time    0.23 mins    1.72 millis    0.23 mins

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and limitations of using WebAssembly (Wasm) with garbage collection (GC) for real-time graphics applications. It argues that while Wasm provides significant performance benefits, the current state of Wasm GC is not mature enough to handle the demands of real-time graphics efficiently. The author highlights issues such as latency, performance overhead, and the inconsistency of GC behavior that could hinder the development of interactive applications. Additionally, the piece emphasizes the importance of understanding these limitations for developers considering Wasm for graphics-intensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Does progress for WASM GC mean progress for DOM access as well?Every time I check back on that the initiative seems to run under a different name. What is the best way to track progress on that front?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really liked NaCl (and PNaCl) idea, which allows running arbitrary code, sanitized, with ~90% speed of native execution. Playing Bastion game in browser was refreshing. Unfortunately communication with js code and bootstrap issues (can't run code without plugin, no one except chrome supported this) ruined that tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750781</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline of the traditional personal computer (PC) and the shift towards more personalized and mobile computing devices. It argues that as technology evolves, the focus should return to enhancing personal user experiences rather than simply upgrading hardware specifications. The author advocates for a more intuitive and user-centric approach to computing, emphasizing the need for devices that better cater to individual needs and lifestyles, rather than conforming to a homogenized standard. The piece encourages embracing innovation that enhances the personal connection users have with their technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convenience kills. I think every sane individual in the world knows the article speaks the truth, and I think everyone wants this to happen. But corporations are not individuals, corps are their own life-form, and even though humans make up the corp, the corp is not human, it is not even inhumane, it is a whole different thing, and the humans that operate it has very little influence on it.So, as far as a corp can understand anything, it can't understand this human article. I don't know if one can write articles that a corp can understand, maybe it cannot understand medium in the same way we can.. It seems to act based on information it sees in "markets" and "consumer behaviour", and we don't yet know how to write an article with those (even if "vote with your money" was once believed to be it, until we discovered that mankind as a whole is not an individual that can make a decision)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expect these comments to be full of agreement. Corporate behavior in the computer space leaves much to he desired.I will however observe;None of the supplied examples showed any form of network effect. It was all stuff you did at home.Today, there are certainly options for personal computing for most everything- as long as network effects are not in play.Those options may not be as convenient, as cheap, or as feature-rich as the invasive option. That's fair though - you decide what you want to prioritize.Network effects are harder to deal with. To the extent that in order to be in community you need to adopt the software the community has chosen.Not surprisingly, software producers that can build-in network effects, do so. It's excellent from a lock-in point of view.The title of the article is perhaps then ironic. It's trivial to make computing personal. All the tools to do so already exist.The issue is not Personal Computing. It's Community Computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article made me even more sad than I already was. I've just been reading about Bambu Lab (a leading 3d printer manufacturer, who introduced really good 3d printers a couple of years ago and really shook up the entire market) self-destructing itself and burning through all the goodwill accumulated over the years. They are working on closing down access to their printers, apparently with the end goal of locked-down subscription-based access. This is much like the path that HP followed with their printers.I also write this on a Mac, where I'm watching with sadness the formerly great company being run by bean-counters, who worry about profits, not user experience. The Mac is being progressively locked down and many things break in the process. Yes, it is still better than Windows, where apparently the start menu is just advertising space and the desktop isn't mine, but Microsoft's, but the path is definitely sloping down.It's just sad.I don't know what else to write. There isn't much we can do, as long as everybody tolerates this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763095</guid></item><item><title>14.

I sometimes feel Phoenix has become the hammer we sort of use on everything, but maybe there are better ways (e.g. for more content focused websites).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m getting a weird issue with scrolling on this page: https://hologram.page/docs/quick-start (iOS safari)I seem to only be able to scroll once, then it freezes. Tapping the URL bar kinda resets it and lets me scroll again, but then it freezes again.It looks like a static page so I’m not sure what would be causing that, but a total guess would be re-renders on the code blocks? Not sure if that makes sense though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710376</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a tiny certificate authority (CA) using a Raspberry Pi and a YubiKey for enhanced security. It explains the benefits of having a personal CA, such as managing certificates for devices and services securely. The guide walks readers through the necessary hardware and software requirements, installation procedures, and configuration steps, ensuring users can create a self-hosted CA that leverages the strong authentication capabilities of the YubiKey. Additionally, it covers potential use cases and considerations for users interested in implementing their own certificate infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This being raspberry pi absolves you from needing to buy a separate hardware noise generator: it has plenty of GPIO. For example, one can obtain entropy by sampling random noise generated by reverse-biasing a junction in a cheap pn transistor. Here is an example: http://holdenc.altervista.org/avalanche/. Bonus — maybe it will get you hooked on electrical engineering!Btw, some versions of raspberry pi already have hardware random number number generator accessible at 
/dev/hwrng.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"with a Yubikey" is probably a better title. The yubikey thingy costs more than the PI (and there is a helpful link if you want to buy one).Very little of this has to do with a PI, it seems like almost any kind of home server would work (especially linux). And it is unclear to me what value is added by the yubikey? And would any FIDO device work, or is this yubikey brand only?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm running smallstep CA in my homelab. While it's nicely done and clearly focuses to the containerized enterprise market, its defaults are very harsh.Take for example the maximum certificate duration. While from a production/security perspective short-lived certificates are great, you don't want to renew certs in your homelab every 24-48hrs. Also, many things just don't support ACME but still benefit from a valid certificate, e.g. router/firewall/appliance web interfaces. Out of the box, the limit for traditionally issued certificates using the CLI is very low, too.The default prevents expired certificates to be renewed. If your homelab does not offer a couple of nines behind the comma, you'll pretty much have to intervene on a regular basis UNLESS you adjust the defaults. You can't set the max duration to years, months or days but only hours:  "claims": {
     "minTLSCertDuration": "24h",
     "maxTLSCertDuration": "26400h",
     "defaultTLSCertDuration": "9000h"
    },

If the goal of hour homelab is to design/test/experiment with a fault-tolerant high availability k8s infra, e.g. for your job, it's great.CAVE: macOS enforces duration limits even for trusted enterprise CAs, e.g. Safari won't accept your 1000 days certificate anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758070</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how to convert a UTC date-time string into a Unix epoch timestamp, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970. It details various methods of performing this conversion using programming languages and tools, such as Python, JavaScript, and command-line utilities. The author provides examples and code snippets to illustrate each method, ensuring ease of understanding for readers looking to manipulate date and time formats in their applications. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of time zone awareness when working with date-time conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it a struggle though?They needed to have a locale matching the language of the localised time string they wanted to parse, they needed to use strptime to parse the string, they needed to use timegm() to convert the result to seconds when seen as UTC. The man pages pretty much describe these things.The interface or these things could certainly be nicer, but most of the things they bring up as issues aren't even relevant for the task they're trying to do. Why do they talk about daylight savings time being confusing when they're only trying to deal with UTC which doesn't have it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My personal rule for time processing: use the language-provided libraries for ONLY 2 operations: converting back and forth between a formatted time string with a time zone, and a Unix epoch timestamp. Perform all other time processing in your own code based on those 2 operations, and whenever you start with a new language or framework, just learn those 2.I've wasted so many dreary hours trying to figure out crappy time processing APIs and libraries. Never again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13 more years to go until the 2038 problem.Surely we'll have everything patched up by then..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758257</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an investigation into a peculiar out-of-memory (OOM) error encountered while using the Rust programming language. It outlines the author's experience with debugging the issue, emphasizing the importance of understanding the Rust ownership model and memory management. The piece highlights various techniques for diagnosing memory problems, such as utilizing tools like Valgrind and Rust’s built-in features. Ultimately, it serves as a guide for Rust developers facing similar memory-related challenges, providing insights into best practices for efficient memory usage and error resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis looks rather half-finished. They did not analyze why so much memory was consumed. If this is the cache which persists after the first call, if it's temporary working memory, or if it's an accumulating memory leak. And why it uses so much memory at all.I couldn't find any other complaints about rust backtrace printing consuming a lot of memory, which I would have expected if this was normal behaviour. So I wonder if there is anything special about their environment or usecase?I would assume that the same OOM problem would arise when printing a panic backtrace. Either their instance has enough memory to print backtraces, or it doesn't. So I don't understand why they only disable lib backtraces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the article they talk about how printing an error from the anyhow crate in debug format creates a full backtrace, which leads to an OOM error. This happens even with 4 GB of memory.Why does creating a backtrace need such a large amount of memory? Is there a memory leak involved as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't they print something that llvm-symbolizer would pick up offline?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708904</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of safeguarding the protocols that underpin Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform developed by Twitter's co-founder. It discusses the potential risks associated with centralized control over social media networks and argues for the necessity of maintaining open protocols to ensure user autonomy, privacy, and freedom of expression. The piece highlights the broader implications of protocol governance on digital culture and communication, advocating for collaborative efforts to strengthen and protect these foundational technologies against monopolistic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't tell why the writers feel that Bluesky's AT protocol is somehow the technologically best, or most politically strategic foundation, for a viable open mechanism for this kind of communication.This article does seem to have the effect of being an endorsement of Bluesky, though.(What I mean by endorsement: "Why would this progressive political operator be saying that we need to focus on freedom safeguards for this Bluesky platform, if it wasn't obviously the place for progressives to be.  And no mention of anything else, like W3C standard ActivityPub, so that's right out.  Clearly we must once again get behind a platform that someone owns.  And then work from a position of weakness, like activists.  Since that went so well for the co-author's former MoveOn.org, as evidenced by the incoming administration.  And we can keep telling people they are under attack, and keep raising donations from them, to continue the fight.")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The internet doesn’t need to be like this. As luck would have it, a new way is emerging just in time.  If you’ve heard of Bluesky...Why do they write as if activitypub and mastodon do not exist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky is two completely separate things:1) A Twitter clone without the political baggage and chaos of the current Twitter ownership.2) A vastly overengineered distributed software system with a strong ideological commitment to federated design.There's no inherent relationship between the two, but a lot of the people who run 1 are heavily committed to 2, and so end up sowing a lot of confusion about it.I would wager that most Bluesky users don't care about it being decentralized, and in fact want a lot of features (soft block, private blocklists) that the federated design makes impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752703</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the humorous analogy between Git's autocorrect feature and the high-speed world of Formula One racing. It highlights how Git's rapid corrections can sometimes overwhelm users, much like the lightning-fast pace that drivers endure on the racetrack. The author elaborates on common Git commands that users might mistype and how the autocorrect feature attempts to correct these errors quickly, drawing a parallel to a pit crew's efficiency during a race. Ultimately, the piece demonstrates the balance between speed and accuracy in both technology and motorsport.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For reference, Valtteri Bottas supposedly recorded a 40ms!!! reaction time at the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix.https://www.formula1.com/en/video/valtteri-bottas-flying-fin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Originally, if you typed an unknown command, it would just say "this is not a git command".Back in the 70s, Hal Finney was writing a BASIC interpreter to fit in 2K of ROM on the Mattel Intellivision system. This meant every byte was precious. To report a syntax error, he shortened the message for all errors to:    EH?

I still laugh about that. He was quite proud of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The root cause here is poorly named settings.If the original setting had been named something bool-y like `help.autocorrect_enabled`, then the request to accept an int (deciseconds) would've made no sense. Another setting `help.autocorrect_accept_after_dsec` would've been required. And `dsec` is so oddball that anyone who uses it would've had to look up.I insist on this all the time in code reviews. Variables must have units in their names if there's any ambiguity. For example, `int timeout` becomes `int timeout_msec`.This is 100x more important when naming settings, because they're part of your public interface and you can't ever change them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760620</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Divers recently recovered an ancient shipwreck that sank approximately 2,600 years ago off the coast of Spain, revealing artifacts that provide insights into maritime trade during the time of the Phoenicians. The ship, which is believed to have been involved in commerce, contained various items such as ceramics and metal objects. This discovery adds to the understanding of ancient cultures and their interactions through trade in the Mediterranean. The site is an important archaeological find that emphasizes the significance of underwater exploration in uncovering historical narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

The “dem” part will only be on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to bear in mind, if anyone feels like trying out this old stuff, is that modems relied on the latency being absolutely fixed; as was guaranteed in the POTS network - and of course an analogue connection. Modern VoIP calling does not guarantee this at all, and even if you have a landline it will almost certainly  have been converted to run on VoIP by now. There were compatibility fixes (such as V.150.1)  but given the limited usage it would not be  surprising if they have bitrotted at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is brilliant and elegant. It's quite satisfying to have ways to have older computers communicate with the rest of the world.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proliferation of charity and community bookshops is substantially the product of tax policy. Commercial property is taxed at ~50% of the nominal rental value, but charities are substantially or wholly exempt from this tax. Importantly, this tax is owed regardless of whether the property is occupied; for a commercial landlord, it is therefore preferable to lease a unit to a charity at a peppercorn rent if the unit is expected to remain vacant for some time. This has had a profound effect on the makeup of retail tenants, particularly in small towns with high vacancy rates, which some argue amounts to a harmful market distortion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be honest, I prefer charity shops to professional shops for 2nd hand books.That said, I still visit professional shops rather more than I should (it depends on the shop.)Of course charity shops are cheaper, that's part of the appeal, but I have more success in them because they are less discerning.Over the years I've acquired a LOT of books, so now I tend to limit myself more. Mostly I now collect science fiction, with an emphasis on work pre 1970. These were made cheap, and are usually in "poor" condition now.Professional shops won't shelve them, whereas charity shops will, so I have more success there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A.Z. Fell has a decent bookshop but when I called recently they said: "Fell's Bookshop. We probably don't have what you're looking for and we wouldn't sell it to you if we did."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712341</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it's used in industry sometimes, ROS is really one of those by-and-for-academia tools. There's a reason it's near-universally reviled, and why "migrate off of ROS" is a standing goal at a lot of robotics companies.There's also a reason why it's a standing goal, rather than a completed goal.It does little or nothing really well, but it does everything kind of okay.There's a lot of "alternatives", most of which do something much better, sometimes much much much better, than ROS, but none of which can replace it all completely. PyRobot, Viam, OROCOS, Webots, all of these do some things much better than ROS, but none of them can drop in and easily replace everything without a lot of developer time, often adding new features to the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to use ROS2 twice in my professional career. Both times ended up with massively bloated build pipeline code, significantly longer build times, and massively bloated Docker images.Don't use ROS2. The benefits just aren't worth it. It's great for school but it's terrible for production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ROS project has terrible governance, and the community suffers heavily from groupthink.I just got banned from their forum for questioning what the ROS Foundation has done in the past two years--specifically on the build system. Yes, their middleware is unforgiving of alternative ways other than their wrong and outdated development practices, but their community is more religiously attached to their precious tools for development.This is the post I wrote:

What if anything can we learn from this to understand the jury system and prosecutorial process?Also, I have watched a bunch of series and I have not once noticed anyone click the obvious “hack”: the last person to enter the breakfast room after a kill night is almost always a faithful, because of the TV cliffhanger of viewers hanging on which of two faithful survived. It’s the best truth signal the game gives and I’ve never seen a player mention it. Maybe TV edits the knowledge out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This game (under the "Mafia" name) has been popular in Finnish math-contest circles since some time in the 1990s, probably as a Russian import. In large groups there can be many more roles, such as the axe-wielding lone killer, the police chief who gets reliable information from the game master, and the doctor who can rescue a victim if they guess correctly. Lots of fun.Someone mentioned Blood on the Clocktower &lt;https://bloodontheclocktower.com/&gt; which has many more roles and a more complicated game that can take hours. The upside is that you aren't out of the game when you are eliminated.In the other direction, there is a One Night Ultimate Werewolf ruleset &lt;https://www.wargamer.com/one-night-ultimate-werewolf/review&gt; that leads to a much faster game because it's not iterated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42755251</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“… we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training”Ha ha ha. Even written agreements are routinely violated as long as the potential upside &gt; downside, and all you have is verbal agreement? And you didn’t disclose this?At the time o3 was released I wrote “this is so impressive that it brings out the pessimist in me”[0], thinking perhaps they were routing API calls to human workers.Now we see in reality I should’ve been more cynical, as they had access to the benchmark data but verbally agreed (wink wink) not to train on it.[0: https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=agnosticmantis#42476... ]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A co-founder of Epoch left a note in the comments:&gt; We acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions, with the exception of a unseen-by-OpenAI hold-out set that enables us to independently verify model capabilities. However, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training.Ouch. A verbal agreement. As the saying goes, those aren't worth the paper they're written on, and that's doubly true when you're dealing with someone with a reputation like Altman's.And aside from the obvious flaw in it being a verbal agreement, there are many ways in which OpenAI could technically comply with this agreement while still gaining a massive unfair advantage on the benchmarks to the point of rendering them meaningless. For just one example, knowing the benchmark questions can help you select training data that is tailored to excelling at the benchmarks without technically including the actual question in the training data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do people actually think OpenAI is gaming benchmarks?I know they have lost trust and credibility, especially on HN. But this is a company with a giant revenue opportunity to sell products that work.What works for enterprise is very different from “does it beat this benchmark”.No matter how nefarious you think sama is, everything points to “build intelligence as rapidly as possible” rather than “spin our wheels messing with benchmarks”.In fact, even if they did fully lie and game the benchmark - do you even care? As an OpenAI customer, all I care about is that the product works.I code with o1 for hours every day, so I am very excited for o3 to be released via API. And if they trained on private datasets, I honestly don’t care. I just want to get a better coding partner until I’m irrelevant.Final thought - why are these contractors owed a right to know where funding came from? I would definitely be proud to know I contributed to the advancement of the field of AI if I was included in this group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763231</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a case study exploring the design process and conceptual framework behind the project "Under Whose Command," which examines themes of power, authority, and identity in contemporary society. It highlights the collaborative approach taken by the design team, the methodologies used, and the significance of the resulting work in fostering dialogue about the implications of command and control within various contexts. The study emphasizes the interplay between design, narrative, and audience engagement, showcasing how the project aims to provoke thought and reflection on the structures of leadership and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go into detail on their technical decision making, very cool:Choosing Clojure6 and Datalog7 was a calculated risk–but one which paid off. The Datalog model offered the simplest and most ergonomic queries, had strengths in graphs and relationships, and the entity model could easily transform to more standard formats. In–memory Datomic was chosen on the server, allowing complicated relational rule–based queries to map over tens of thousands of claims, linking sources to the attributes of entities. Using Clojure allowed for rapid prototyping and fast feedback cycles. Together, this allowed constructing arbitrary graph traversal queries, without having to round–trip from the database to execute recursive code, allowing the nature of traversing the domain model to be separated from the specifics of the relationship. How entities relate, and how relations work through time, could be developed as separate concepts. Using Datalog queries, it was possible to get every subordinate, as well as the time ranges they held true for, with a simple query like (subordinate-of ?a ?b ?start-date ?end-date)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting and I think important. Something that should be done for any Armee even.I found the writing style … interesting. The author assumed we the reader would have a specific understanding how to model this data. And that they cracked the code. Well that military posts, commands and in some cases government loyalty can change is known. Maybe I read too much into it this morning :). I dislike being treated as ignorant that’s all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a reason Russian forces are wearing face-covers in Ukraine. That anonymity even became integral part of the official propaganda with the country plastered with images with covered faces like this https://ok.ru/group/53906516017252/album/922573735012/931001...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42723464</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of how heat typically disrupts order in physical systems, leading to increased entropy and disorder. However, it highlights a special case where certain systems can maintain some level of order despite rising temperatures. The piece explores the underlying principles of this remarkable behavior, examining how specific interactions or structures in materials enable them to retain some degree of organization even in hotter conditions. This counterintuitive result has implications for understanding phase transitions, material science, and potentially for the development of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now if only I could purchase one**I realize enterprise “GPUs” are difficult to purchase as an individual whether they’re AMD or Nvidia, but AMD might be well-served to mimic their RX 480 strategy (“make a competitive mid-range GPU, distribute it through several board partners, and sell it at rock-bottom prices to get it to as many customers as possible”). If there’s a compelling reason to use AMD hardware over Nvidia, the software support will come. As an extreme example, if one could purchase an MI300X for $50 a pop, surely FAANG and others would invest time and effort into the software side to leverage the cost savings vs Nvidia, who is unquestionably price-gouging due to their monopolistic hold on the enterprise GPU market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those are some sketchy bar charts. If the bar doesn't start at y=0 and you don't even have axis ticks, it's meaningless and just a colorful blob on your slide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our team has access to multiple systems that either have MI250Xs or H100s. Getting stuff to work with AMD/ROCm is substantially more effort than the NVIDIA/CUDA experience.Some of this is lack of groundwork/engineering by packages or system administrators, but it seems a decent amount is the relative lack of effort by AMD to make things work well OOTB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718656</guid></item><item><title>32.

Real people publishing real stuff.Last year X started occasionally showing some random content like Reddit, I'd mark them as "not interesting" and move on.Since last month there's no tech content by tech people, there's exclusively junk worse than on Reddit's homepage. No amount of "not interesting" will fix it. Oh, there's porn now too.I stopped opening X altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me the worst part is not even the feed (I can use “following” tab) but the replies. I often used to look at single threads to see replies there. Since they started prioritizing replies from premium users it turned into cesspool and I eventually stopped using X altogether&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use X to mostly follow politics and some math/physics, and the political feed in the "For you" tab is remarkably balanced. I actually maintain two separate lists called "Left" and "Right" that I slot accounts into, and I just go to each list's feed to see what each side is saying about something. The "For you" tab has a mix, and overall has been pretty well balanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42755173</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed explanation of indentation in Lisp programming, discussing its importance for readability and code structure. It outlines various indentation styles and conventions used in Lisp, including specific examples for different scenarios. Additionally, it covers how to apply these conventions in practice, helping developers write cleaner and more maintainable Lisp code by adhering to established formatting guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

        (define (ok? datum)
            (every 
                (lambda (restriction)
                    (restriction datum)
                )
                restrictions
            )
        )
        (define (element-match data dictionary succeed)
            (and 
                (ok? data)
                (let ((vcell (match:lookup variable dictionary)))
                    (if vcell
                        (and 
                            (equal? (match:value vcell) data)
                            (succeed dictionary)
                        )
                        (succeed (match:bind variable data dictionary))
                    )
                )
            )
        )
        element-match
    )

It may not be densest or most compact indentation scheme, but damn is it readable for someone without a lisp/scheme background!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any formatters that detect related things and put them in the same column? Here's a Pie example:  (claim  Tuple3 (-&gt;                U       U     U    U))

&lt;p&gt;The article by Paul Graham reflects on Twitter's impact and its significance as a communication platform. It discusses the unique aspects of Twitter, such as its brevity and real-time engagement, which invite diverse conversations and ideas. Graham explores the platform's advantages for users, like fostering creativity and enabling rapid access to information. He also considers the potential downsides of Twitter, including the spread of misinformation and the nature of online discourse. Ultimately, the piece presents Twitter as a powerful tool that shapes contemporary communication while acknowledging its complexities and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PG was/is completely wrong. Twitter was supposed to be the new SMS, or text message protocol, but that never happened. RSS is an example of a protocol in that space. At best, Twitter was/is an API.In a practical utility perspective Twitter was a pub/sub broadcast system in the social media space. It was slim, fast, and real time in a way the Facebook wasn’t, due to a 140 character limit. Yet, it never seemed to become more than 10% of Facebook and almost exclusively used only by people who were already heavy Facebook users.I remember the optimism around Twitter in 2007 because it was immediately evident that it was addictive to certain personalities. Some people just had to broadcast absolutely everything they did, often irrationally. Most everyone else tried to find a use for Twitter but couldn’t. I know many early users that either abandoned or deleted their accounts before 2010.Eventually it just became a text broadcast interface via their client. That is good for people who want to build a following, but nobody else found a use for it. In that regard YouTube is the Twitter replacement but YouTube had value otherwise that Twitter never could.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Paul Graham fella seems to be a trumpet of bad ideas.
His hype-takes on tech influence laypeoples notions of the world.
His failure to clarify how tech functions is misleading.Techne is the Greek word for hand.
Xitter is a megaphone owned by and fully utilized by a misanthropic bully.
In no way shape or form is it a voice of the people. 
It is weighted multicast media with owners and nobility and a feed and an algorithm for prioritizing the owner and the nobility in the feed.A protocol? Ha! We knew it wasn't a protocol or layer for anything before the so-called Arab Spring.How many bad ideas has Paul Graham defended?Despite the continuing proliferation of crypto-currency pyramid schemes, and their continuing ability to fool investors, they are a net negative for a planet in the throes of a climate meltdown.Despite the reverent tones of baffled journalists speaking of LLMs as AI, despite the tech CEOs claiming that developers will be replaced tomorrow, anyone who knows anything about LLMs rolls their eyes, amd yet Paul will reliably write apologies for yet another destructive wave of investments in lousy scamware companies.The king of bad ideas, chewed into bite size pieces for the masses.What do i know, I'm obviously very unhip in this sort of fabricated false world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In early 2000-2007 I felt technology optimism (things like Digg, slashdot) about new websites and there was a hopefulness about new technology (file sharing) The spirit of new technology that "there is something new" and the "this is how things work from now on" (WAP websites, floppy disks, guest books, simple 1megabyte web hosting, geocities, fan sites, myspace, WhatsApp on cheap phones).In other words, every new thing was something that may have been before but it was "this is how things work from now on". The platform defines and upholds the character of interaction. Twitter and Reddit do that and as pg highlights how twitter recipients is by algorithm. (From OP: "where you don't specify the recipients.")I have fond memories of writing HTML from magazines and in the eras before me it was handwriting text games into BASIC interpreters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760054</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m glad they actually tried synthesizing one of the materials their model predicted. Looks like they succeeded in synthesizing only 1 out of 4 of the materials for which they tried. The 20% accurate property claim appears to be for bulk modulus. I’m still seeing little value for this technology for designing electronic properties, mainly because density functional theory which provides the training data is not reliable. Their code looks nice and clean and well organized, perhaps I’ll give it a try.My biggest problem with this application of AI is trying to approximate DFT, which itself is an unreliable approximation. The claim is it lets you amortize the expensive DFT to search the space, but it’s also true that especially for inorganic materials, training sets do not appear to promote strong generalization. So you embark on an expensive task to wind up back with unreliable DFT. I think perhaps the best goal would be to try to make DFT itself better, and I have seen impressive albeit computationally expensive approaches, e.g. FermiNet by DeepMind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42727329</guid></item><item><title>40.

However, learning this topic on your own can be challenging because many online resources are unclear, and sample codes often only cover the basics. You might find yourself unsure of what to do next. That's why I created this tutorial. It aims to give you clear guidelines and plenty of examples to help you understand better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a guide about Linux Cgroups programming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know - Is there a guide like this that does this with Python instead of the C Socket API?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756365</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The content discusses the features and functionalities of the Mastodon social media platform, highlighting its decentralized nature and user-friendly interface. It emphasizes the importance of community interactions and privacy, as well as the platform's appeal to users seeking an alternative to traditional social media giants. The article also touches on the challenges of moderation and the cultural aspects of utilizing a federated network for social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a shame it had to come to this but I can see why Element had to make this choice.To me it feels like they've ended up in a position similar to Docker Inc. where they've spent years of work and tons of resources building the standards and reference implementations, but missed out on the juicy integration and support contracts.Docker has turned into the OCI standard and most Kubernetes deployment don't even run containerd anymore. The company has massively rate limited Docker hub and recently increased the pricing again, which has had much bigger impact for end users than this pivot by Element.I really hope this works out as a funding source for future Matrix development, I don't see how its ecosystem can continue to be developed and healthy without Element.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find this comment interesting: https://mastodon.matrix.org/@element/113848890455666110 where IMO it is stated that Deutsche Telekom (with HessenConnect 2.0) did the free-riding and "directly contributed to layoffs at Element in 2022 and 2023". It sounds as if Telekom changed its mind after an initial contract or something. Or was Telekom one of many companies that did a similar thing?I know from my own experience that making money based on an open source project is extremely challenging.However, I don't understand why they frame their Pro version in this way and point to failure instead of success. I can't think of a better way (they will have to do the work :)). But it's already a good thing if they've won them as "Matrix believers", and they shouldn't scare them to get there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, the money has to come from somewhere. There's only a handful of companies that make the open source profit game work and last I checked, most of them make their money from B2B deals with support, SLAs, etc. If you want to deploy something at nation scale, surely you can afford to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752402</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like how the author didn’t try to be overly clever with it. They could’ve used Docker to install and isolate dependencies, Caddy or Traefik to serve the site and manage SSL automatically, maybe even k3s to run a mini cluster for HA, Tailscale to avoid manual port forwarding, Terraform for future auto-provisioning without hassle, or Ansible to prepare the machine and all that jazz.Instead, they took the simplest possible route that works: installing the web server on bare metal, serving plain HTML and CSS, and using direct port forwarding via the router. This was a delightful read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had set one (Pi 3B+)up to do both a website as well as a  public service announcement slideshow display for a local Community TV.  Used PHP/CMSimple for the site and wrote a custom slider.Things I learned:- set the pi to reboot on poweroff- Given this was TV used the AV output on the PI displaying in NTSC 4:3 (to support customers with older TVs), so had to be aware of overscan margins- Added a startup script to start chromium in kiosk mode and open the slider page for the show side.  worked 95% of the time, if not just power off then on.- part of the troubleshooting was just unplug and replug - but SD cards will choke on too many power cycles, so instead of SD use a USB-&gt;SATA cable and a regular spinning rust HDD - slower but VERY reliable, the journaling file system can recover after power-outage.- Get the right USB-&gt;SATA cable, USB-3 models seem to be more responsive and the PI can boot from them, there are some are too slow and the Pi will fail to boot.- Slider had it's own login page (outside of CMSimple) to remotely manage the slideshow.- Also changed the SSH Port to something uncommon to thwart bad guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Step 5: Getting an HTTPS CertificateIf you’re using Apache2 you might also want to look at mod_md, not just certbot: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_md.htmlAlso, if you want to minimize the amount of JS, then just drop jQuery and use fetch, it’s reasonably pleasant too: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_APILovely article!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712378</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques the trend of forcing dark mode across applications and websites, arguing that it should be a user choice rather than a default setting. The author explains how dark mode can negatively impact visibility and usability for some users, particularly in certain lighting conditions and for those with visual impairments. They emphasize the importance of providing options that cater to individual preferences and promoting user control over their own experience. The piece also highlights the potential downsides of dark mode, including reduced readability and distractions in certain contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark mode was the traditional normal.From early green or amber text on black mono displays.
Grey on black DOS text mode.
Light Blue on Dark Blue C-64.
Apple 2's grey/white (I don't recall) on black.
Even GUI wise, Amiga used a dark-blue background as the default Workbench, with user selectable palettes for everything.It was Microsoft Windows that changed the paradigm to default to a searing white display with black text in most apps, like Notepad, Word, etc., because "it's more like paper".  Sure, paper is white, but it's not glowing white.  That transition was painful.I'm glad to see dark-modes return, I agree there needs to be an option, not just forced dark-mode.  Preferably light mode options to use a not-as-bright-as-possible white too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well hang on a sec. If a website is dark with light text and has just that one style, then that's it's theme, it's vibe. Dark mode only exists if there is a light mode, and give versa.Don't force having to maintain two modes on websites who don't want to?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with this. Default, unconfigurable light mode has been around for a while, and infrastructure like the Dark Reader plugin is around to address this. There is no such thing for light mode, though.In my opinion, light mode is better than dark mode in most situations. The only situation dark mode is better than light mode is when you're sitting in a dark room with your screen as your only light source, and most of the time that's not really a healthy situation to be in. Dark mode is a crutch. Turn on a light or go to sleep.Light mode might be annoying to read in no-light environments, but dark mode is nigh impossible to read in high-light environments. Ever try to read a dark mode UI on your phone on a bright summer's day? Can't read a thing, even with brightness cranked all the way up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762054</guid></item><item><title>44.

Coming from a point of ignorance here: I lucked into some higher and DLAs (though not 5v compatible so they wouldn't directly help here) and their softwares allow both decode and measurements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reliability of this e-shifter in the X3 and S3 has been argued as the cause of the failure and eventual bankruptcy of VanMoofI always wondered what exactly the problem e-shifters were trying to solve was. Is it the "ugliness" of shifting cables? Route them through the frame...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710953</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has decided to remove the iconic TrackPoint nub from its latest ThinkPad laptops, a feature that has been a defining characteristic of the series for decades. This change has sparked disappointment among long-time ThinkPad users, who valued the TrackPoint for its precision and convenience. While Lenovo aims to modernize its designs and features, many loyal customers express concern that the removal of the TrackPoint may detract from the usability and appeal of the new models. The article discusses the implications of this decision for Lenovo's brand identity and its user base.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of a weirdly written article. Only one model removed the nub, and it's from one of its "we're trying to be MacBook" lines (the X line, like the Z line, are more about form than function). And all that tech shipped in its other lines for a while, afaik.I recently sold a Z13 because it had so many quirks (low battery life due to OLED, trackpad and trackpoint were crap, bluetooth barely worked through the dense metal chassis, display didn't fold down 180 degrees, felt heavy af).I got a T14s instead. Holy crap, it is so much better. Feels lighter, the touchpad and trackpoint are great, 500nits low-energy display is "ok" but battery can last all day. I use the trackpoint all the time (partly due to the touchpad drifting for some reason, and partly just to have a more precise pointer for fine work). The only downside is the lack of more USB-C ports.A random upside if you order it with Ubuntu: it comes with Secure Boot set up correctly. But then a downside: Linux kernel prevents hibernate from working if Secure Boot is enabled, unless you set up an encrypted swap and jump through hoops to set up the bootloader right (and of course it's not set up on Ubuntu). I can't believe it's still such a pain to get otherwise-standard laptop functionality with Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Does that mean the TrackPoint is dead? No, thankfully. It will still appear in the other ThinkPads made by Lenovo, said a company spokesman.This is not about the death of the nub, but about how far the Thinkpad brand name can be diluted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real tragedy is the omission of top TrackPad buttons.Middle-click paste is widely used in Linux, and while I tried mouse emulators with limited success, it sure is good to have a physical button at your thumb.  With a tiling window manager, you can copy (by visual select depending on the application) and paste (middle-click) without ever leaving your home row across multiple windows.  This is a serious work flow tool in REPL.Moreover the new haptic feedback they got on button-less TrackPads have motors etc which are not as reliable as million-click-tested ThinkPads' physical buttons.Laptops are the tools of our trade, and unfortunately, we cannot make too many compromises, especially for the sake of trendy aesthetics.  If ThinkPads want to be MacBooks, then we might as well buy MacBooks; indeed, many of us already do. Almost a decade ago, Lenovo already made a similar mistake with 2nd generation Carbon X1 (and some T series) and they had to revert back. Having a diversity in the market place is important, and I surely hope Lenovo keeps ThinkPads as uniquely performant as they have been since the IBM days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758570</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have multiple degrees in philosophy and I have no idea what this article is even trying to say.If anyone has access to the full article, I’m interested, but it sounds like a lot of buzzwords and not a ton of substance.The framing of ai through a philosophical lens is obviously interesting, but a lot of the problems addressed in the intro are pretty much irrelevant to the ai-ness of the information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; what counts as knowledge (epistemology), and how AI represents reality (ontology) also shape value creation.As a skeptic with only a few drums to beat, my quasi-philosophical complaint about LLMs: we have a rampant problem where humans confuse a character they perceive out of a text-document with a real-world author.In all these hyped-products, you are actually being given the "and then Mr. Robot said" lines from a kind of theater-script. This document grows as your contribution is inserted as "Mr. User says",  plus whatever the LLM author calculates "fits next."So all these excited articles about how SomethingAI has learned deceit or self-interest? Nah, they're really probing how well it assembles text (learned from ones we make) where we humans can perceive a fictional character which exhibits those qualities. That can including qualities we absolutely know the real-world LLM does not have.It's extremely impressive compared to where we used to be, but not the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philosophy eats AI because we're in the exploration phase of the s-curve and there's a whole bunch of VC money pumping into the space. When we switch to an extraction regime, we can expect a lot of these conversations to evaporate and replaced with, "what makes us the most money" regardless of philosophic implication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760210</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Open Dylan is a collaborative initiative aimed at the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive, openly accessible resource for the works of musician Bob Dylan. The site features a diverse collection of his lyrics, songs, and recordings, along with critical analyses and tools for studying Dylan's music. It serves both as a scholarly archive for researchers and a fan-driven platform, promoting the understanding and appreciation of Dylan’s artistic contributions through community engagement and open-source principles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious - what is Dylan really for? Who should use it, and in what situations? I totally could have missed something obvious, but I read through the intro and the ‘Tour’, and it has a lot of detail about what the language is, but not much on when and where to use it. The closest thing seems to be it’s LISP but faster? What are the reasons to choose Dylan over C++, Swift, JavaScript, or Python?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll say this because it's possible to go from my username to name anyway: I share a name with this language. And usually that's fine because it's not very widely used. But seeing this headline was certainly a surprise on an otherwise calm Sunday morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember Apple giving away Dylan CDs when Java was first released.
I learned them both and went with Java.
But I should have taken the opportunity to also learn the Common Lisp Object System.These days we like to bitch about OOP languages, but we could have had better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756896</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK, these are a LOT of fun to play with. I've been trying out a quantized version of the Llama 3 one from here: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-...The one I'm running is the 8.54GB file. I'm using Ollama like this:    ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0

You can prompt it directly there, but I'm using my LLM tool and the llm-ollama plugin to run and log prompts against it. Once Ollama has loaded the model (from the above command) you can try those with uvx like this:    uvx --with llm-ollama \
      llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \
      'a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together'

Here's what I got - the joke itself is rubbish but the "thinking" section is fascinating: https://gist.github.com/simonw/f505ce733a435c8fc8fdf3448e381...I also set an alias for the model like this:    llm aliases set r1l 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' 

Now I can run "llm -m r1l" (for R1 Llama) instead.I wrote up my experiments so far on my blog: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.We've been running qualitative experiments on OpenAI o1 and QwQ-32B-Preview [1]. In those experiments, I'd say there were two primary things going against QwQ. First, QwQ went into endless repetitive loops, "thinking out loud" what it said earlier maybe with a minor modification. We had to stop the model when that happened; and I feel that it significantly hurt the user experience.It's great that DeepSeek-R1 fixes that.The other thing was that o1 had access to many more answer / search strategies. For example, if you asked o1 to summarize a long email, it would just summarize the email. QwQ reasoned about why I asked it to summarize the email. Or, on hard math questions, o1 could employ more search strategies than QwQ. I'm curious how DeepSeek-R1 will fare in that regard.Either way, I'm super excited that DeepSeek-R1 comes with an MIT license. This will notably increase how many people can evaluate advanced reasoning models.[1] https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/discussions/2608&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: I am very well aware this is not a valid test or indicative or anything else. I just thought it was hilarious.When I asked the normal "How many 'r' in strawberry" question, it gets the right answer and argues with itself until it convinces itself that its (2). It counts properly, and then says to it self continuously, that can't be right.https://gist.github.com/IAmStoxe/1a1e010649d514a45bb86284b98...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42768072</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reality for most graduates is even grimmer:&gt; • £25,000 starting salaries at traditional engineering firms&gt; • Exodus to consulting or finance just because it's compensated betterThis is _exactly_ my career so far.The key thing about the British economy is that while most things operate in a free market, construction is centrally planned by councillors who are incentivised to block most development. So the whole economy is struggling, but industries that need physical space are especially hard hit. Your local council can't block you from writing more code, but can stop you from building lab space near where people want to live and work.My first job out of uni was in a wonderful small engineering firm in Cambridge. Lab space there is eye-wateringly expensive because it's illegal to build enough, so we were based in a makeshift lab in an attic next to the sewage works. I loved working there, but it shows that we're restricting our small businesses unnecessarily through our planning system.The solution is frustratingly simple, but politically suicidal for any government that tried to implement it: just legalise development subject to basic design codes. I hope we see some planning reform before it's too late for our struggling innovation industries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think it’s just a UK thing, or that it’s much easier to start a hardware startup in the USA.I think it’s more that the bar for getting a hardware startup off the ground is much higher than a software startup - everywhere in the world.Personally I’ve been trying to self-fund and bootstrap a hardware startup (based in Australia but I’m reasonably well connected in Silicon Valley as I’m a YC alum). I’ve had plenty of early success and validation of all my market theses, but it’s super hard to get any investors interested. Plenty say “exciting” and want to chat. All lose interest when you start talking funding needs and path to market.In a world in which investors and other startup industry contacts are accustomed to seeing a bootstrapped SaaS app showing signs of growth and revenue just a few months in, with a hardware startup it’s just impossible to avoid looking like a failure by comparison - due to all the costs, delays and complications involved with getting an MVP to market. And because successful hardware startups are so scarce relative to software ones, it’s hard even to get any good advice; there’s just barely anyone around with good, relevant experience to share (and I already know many of the people who have built companies in this vertical in past decades, none of whom are in SV).I’ve come to the conclusion that the only way to make it work is to start by achieving success as a software startup, then transition into hardware to later - but even then you’d have to convince investors that it’s worth the risk.In short, the whole tech industry has been spoiled by easy SaaS wins over the past decade, and that’s all that most investors are willing to even consider.The exceptions are “start-big and-get-huge-fast” plays like Groq - but the founders of that company were already highly credentialed and connected when they started, and even then vanishingly few investors are willing/able to fund new companies like that. That’s not the kind of thing young, unproven founders can pull off, anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a Brit, when I was raising the seed round for my startup, UK and European VCs would consistently try to haggle you down on price while the American VC's were exclusively focussed on trying to figure out whether this could be a billion dollar business or not (in the end we raised a $5m seed led by Spark, and have done extremely well and raised more since).The UK lost Deep Mind - which could have been OpenAI!! -- to Google. I think part of the issue is cultural - the level of ambition in the UK is just small compared to the US. Individual founders like Demis or Tom Blomfield may have it but recruiting enough talent with the ambition levels of early Palantir or OpenAI employees is so hard because there are so few. Instead, a lot of extremely smart people in the UK would rather get the 'safe' job at Google, or McKinsey than the 'this will never work but can you imagine how cool it would be if it did' job at a startup.There are probably political reasons as well. Unfortunately the UK has not been well governed for 20 years or so, and hence economic outcomes as a whole have been abysmal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763386</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article on reverse engineering Bambu Connect provides a detailed guide on how to analyze and understand the functionality of the Bambu Connect software and hardware. It outlines the steps involved in the reverse engineering process, including tools, methods, and techniques used to examine the code and architecture. The guide also discusses potential applications and implications of the reverse engineering findings for users and developers, highlighting the importance of understanding software interactions, troubleshooting, and enhancing user experience within the Bambu ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I don't get...BambuSlicer is open source. And, not only is it open source, it's a fork of PrussaSlicer, so Bambu doesn't have the ability to re-license it.It's licensed under the Affero GPL which is very strict about the licensing of derived works. That license requires Bambu to include the source code to any additions they make, including all of the logic, keys, etc. that they're baking into any binary distributions. If they don't, they're violating the copyright rights of Prussa and many others.So, either Bambu has to open source all of this, which defeats the purpose (given that it's already leaked, that's gonna happen anyway) or they have to route everything through a separate program for their own slicer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am angry at the bait-and-switch Bambu is pulling. I bought one of their printers in the Black Friday sale on the understanding it was reasonably hackable and open. Now they're trying to lock it down so I can't print on my own printer without using their approved software and DRM chain. It's outrageous.More info on the hacking (the first in what may be a long stupid fight): https://hackaday.com/2025/01/19/bambu-connects-authenticatio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish Prusa weren't asleep at the wheel, then we would have bought a core one (that is, the hypothetical variant with large build volume and same quality as bambulab).Instead, we bought a P1S, which is, technically speaking, a fantastic machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764602</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used mixxx to do the djing for my wedding last year. Created a collaborative music voting site for the guests, then got all the music and made a mix which worked really well, even going between genres.  Had a lot of fun playing with it getting everything ready and it worked with a couple of DJ controllers bought cheaply without any issue.I even made a little program to read the now playing track from the sqlite database which then allowed the lights to follow the music (for complex reasons I don't have time to explain).Most importantly it worked on the night without missing a beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been using it for the past few years, nothing bad to say about it, lovely piece of software. Vendor lock-in is very present in this field, with different brands of controllers supported by a myriad of proprietary DJ applications all more interested in onboarding you to their music subscription services rather than implement useful features or support open protocols.Meanwhile, Mixxx allows you to write your own adapter scripts for any controller you have (as long as it outputs MIDI), and there's a built-in library featuring scripts for the most common commercial controllers and MIDI devices out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really happy that 2.5 added 'beats until next marker', which together with a USB controller from Numark I have pretty much feature complete DJ setup for under $500 (including cost of laptop &amp; controller) without having to rely on Windows, Mac, subscription licenses or feature-crippled 'lite' versions.And it's surprising how quickly people adapt to it when they're used to other setups, within an hour a few people have gone from 'oooh, can I have a go' to showing me their own tips, tricks and different styles.Especially combined with a youtube &amp; soundcloud downloader running on a different workspace, I can get pretty much any track into the library within a minute or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769871</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of eSIM technology with devices that only have a physical SIM slot by introducing a 9eSIM card, which allows for the integration of eSIM capabilities in devices that traditionally do not support them, such as certain Android and Linux devices. It covers the benefits of eSIMs, including convenience and flexibility in managing mobile connectivity, and provides guidance on how to set up and use the 9eSIM card to enable eSIM functionality in compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the effects of interruptions on work performance and productivity, highlighting research findings that demonstrate how interruptions can lead to increased errors and longer task completion times. It explores the types of interruptions, such as external distractions and multitasking, and offers strategies for managing them, like establishing boundaries, using technology wisely, and creating a focused work environment. The piece emphasizes the importance of minimizing disruptions to enhance overall efficiency and maintain concentration in both personal and professional settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interruptions are productivity and creativity killers. Middle managers are of questionable utility but that layer of an organization would be much more effective if it focused ruthlessly on removing distractions.I worked at a small company where a significant portion of my effort went toward shielding my team from the distractions created by a CEO who couldn’t seem to help meddling in every aspect of the business. I think it’s because he started out doing, or at least being involved with, many of the functions of the company and had a hard time letting go as we grew. Even after the organization grew to 50+ people he couldn’t keep himself out of the nitty gritty details, but the format of the distraction changed over time. Instead of walking up to people and interrupting them in person (a double whammy according to this study, including both an “important” person and the in-person aspect), he would send what we called “Slack attacks” throughout the day. These were paragraphs-long Slack messages without any semblance of organization, punctuation, or line breaks. Fortunately, many of these messages were sent during the very early hours of the morning so they could be dealt with first thing in the AM, but that wasn’t always the case.In the first phase I literally moved my team location and reorganized the desk arrangement so it was harder for him to get in and bug everyone. I had to “guard” the area and try to stop him from physically entering the space, which was always a strange dance. I couldn’t control his Slack messaging behavior so I worked with people to understand that while yes “the CEO is asking you for urgent work in Slack” seems like a valid reason to switch gears, but instead let me work to figure out what actually needs to be done and we’ll catch up later about what to do.It was a weird dynamic but there was no doubt the distractions were a drag on performance. Every time he went on vacation we saw a marked increase in productivity, and more creative solutions seemed to come up as well. I don’t wish this type of environment on anyone but in a way I’m glad to have gone through it and learned some lessons about interruptions and how to avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;40 or so years later, the book Peopleware by DeMarco and Lister remains the best quantitative study on environmental impacts on developer productivity.The world has changed significantly since it was written, so you have to translate their measurements to modern contexts, but it's easier to translate real data on human behavior than to guess based on guesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Teams is perhaps the worst communication software your company can have for Software Engineers. People usually don't use the half-baked threads capabilities because they're separate and not intuitive, so it's usually just endless chat messages, all at once. And so you get constant pinging all day. And then I need to mute my Teams chats, which is also risky because I could have gotten an important message.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762962</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a personal anecdote of the author's experience of meeting the renowned game developer and creator of the popular character "PG" at a gaming convention. The author reflects on the excitement and nervousness of the encounter, sharing details about the conversation they had and the impact this meeting had on their appreciation for gaming. Overall, it highlights the joy of meeting a personal hero and the memorable moments that come with fandom.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the long run I think realizations like the authors are healthy ones.PG is not a hero. He's just a guy. A guy who entered into business transactions with a number of people, many of whom benefitted greatly (as did Paul himself). I'm not saying any of that as a negative! Just that we have a habit of attributing superhuman characteristics to folks (Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize comes to mind) and ending up disappointed.I'm not an affected group by any means but I still share the disappointment in the world we see today vs the possibilities I felt tech would allow when I was younger. The tech CEOs I previously viewed as visionaries now just look like a new generation of socially regressive robber barons. I wanted to be one of those CEOs, these days I'm still not quite sure what I want to be. My only consolation is knowing that I'm seeing the world more accurately than I once did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, cohesive, and clear essay! Hear hear.One thing that I think is underappreciated in our current times, that gets lost on both the left and the right sides -- an individual is more important than their identity.- A specific trans person can also be an asshole.- A specific white man can also be a saint.Extremists on both political sides will scream about the reasons one or the other of those statements is wrong, but doing so lumps all possible individuals of an identity into a "them" category to which blanket statements, positive or negative, can be applied.That reductionism feels incredibly insulting to our shared, innate humanity.Are there all kinds of subconscious and societal biases that seriously influence our perceptions of others on the basis of their identity? Sure!But it doesn't change the goal of treating the person standing in front of you, first and foremost and always, as an individual person.Be curious. Be courteous and respectful. Be a normal, nice goddamn human to human across the table from you.(And maybe, if you feel so inclined, have some compassion about what they did to get to that table)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I’m certain he wouldn’t be rude to my face, but he might quietly discriminate against me, say no thanks. He might not even think of it as discrimination, only that I don’t have what it takes."This resonates pretty strongly (and depressingly) with me being an immigrant academic in Europe who came originally from a third-world country. Even though I am one of the most productive researchers in my department, even though I studied in the best university in my country (which is mind-blowingly better than the one I'm currently in), even if I say yes to almost everything, and even if I work easily 150% what an average native colleague does, none of this matter at all. Every morning I wake up there is a new knife on my back. Opportunities just vanish transparently; pressure amounts over pressure amounts pressure; there is always that quiet, mute side look that says (without words) "if you don't like it, why don't you leave?".And what really makes this ten times worse is that the country I'm in has this almost ethereal reputation for begin some kind of paradise where everyone is super polite and calm and rational, so whenever I complain about anything it feels like I'm some kind of spoiled child. Half the time I even convince myself of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767507</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the camera used.[1]It's not exotic. It's a 1936 × 1216 Sony sensor with a C-mount lens.
That's below current phone camera resolution. It's monochrome,
which makes sense in this application.They have bigger collecting optics than a phone, and you get better sensitivity without the color filters.I'm not clear on how they get their "down" reference. It's clear how they get heading; that's easy if you can see the stars. But you need an accurate horizon or vertical to get latitude and longitude.
One degree of error in the vertical is maybe 100 km of error in position. How good are drone AHRS systems today in attitude? They have a correction system that works if you fly in a circle, but that just corrects for constant misalignment between camera and down reference.[1] https://www.alliedvision.com/fileadmin/pdf/en/Alvium_1800_U-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see an explanation of what strapdown meant in this context, so I dug one up:"Traditional, stable-platform navigation systems commonly involve separate accelerators and fibers or laser-based gyroscopes, with all the components mechanically and rigidly mounted on a stable platform that is isolated from the moving vehicle. This leads to the drawbacks of large size, poor reliability, and high cost. In contrast, in strapdown navigation systems, the inertial sensors are fastened directly to the vehicle’s body, which means the sensors rotate together with the vehicle. "https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/11/652&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact:The SR-71 and U2 planes had automated celestial navigation systems b/c GPS wasn't around when they came out.There a story in the book about Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works where they mention turning on the system while one of the planes was in the hangar and it locked on to a hole in the roof (sun was shining through the hole and system thought it was a start).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767797</guid></item><item><title>9.

The one thing that really stood out was how the Flash ROM happened to contain a previous version of the hidden ROM sitting right there.  While it didn't exactly match the release version, it still provided a whole lot of information on how the boot sequence worked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The most critical part of the install was nailing the alignment and reflow of not just one, but BOTH ball-grid-arrays for welding over a single rework profile.Oof.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the inner workings of "Zork," a pioneering text-based adventure game that has profoundly influenced the gaming industry. It discusses the game's innovative design, including its complex parser and rich narrative, which allow players to interact with a vast virtual world using natural language commands. The piece highlights the game's development history, its impact on contemporary storytelling in video games, and the ways it engaged players' imaginations, leading to its enduring legacy in interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone's interested, here's a pretty good overview of Infocom's internal development tooling (how they got from the ZIL source code to a compiled story file). https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-toAdditionally, this site is a really cool visualization that lets you play Zork while being able to see its internal game state and the corresponding source code to where you currently are. https://eblong.com/infocom/visi-zork1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modern interactive fiction is pretty amazing.I like Zork a lot, but I've never made it even halfway through the game. Knowing that you can permanently lose by doing certain things (does breaking the mirror count? I can't remember) puts a damper on my enthusiasm. The infocom parser is pretty good, but I sometimes run into issues where I know what I need to do, but can't get the parser to accept my commands. This happened in planetfall where I needed to get a key under a grate, but eventually gave up and looked up what the parser wanted.Some modern additions are automatic maps and fast travel so you don't get lost in an infinite labyrinth and have to write your own maps (it was fun once, but I wouldn't want to do it each game). Fast travel is nice, so I can get back somewhere without having to type N N E NE N and so on.As for this thread and more relevant comments, I had no idea the parser variables were named after the authors. HN knowledge never ceases to amaze me. I wish there was a convention or something once a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I made some maps of things like which rooms of the game have the “sacred” bit, and what it means.If you’re interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/raldi/comments/10dtch/i_spent_my_we...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767132</guid></item><item><title>11.

I just got my green card last year, and it all kind of started with me asking you a question about H1B caps in a thread like this almost a decade ago. Super appreciate you doing this for people that are dreaming of a better future, dreaming of the American dream.Wish you the best!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am married to an american but we are leaving abroad and we never started the process for me to get a green card as we didn't plan to move to the US yet. Is it true that when I apply and get the card I then have a limited amount of time to move in, and if I don't then I would have to start the whole process again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi Peter, thank you for doing this AMA. I am on H1B and I recently lost my job. I only have about 50 days left to get a new job but I have a spouse who is on his own H1B. I wanted to see and find out legal and smooth options to buy more time for myself to find a new job - If anything, it would be those options that do not need me to leave the country and get stamping, if at all. My country of citizenship is India, by the way. If you can help us out, it would be really great.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Think Twice Before Using GitHub Actions" discusses the pros and cons of using GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes. It highlights the advantages, such as integration with GitHub repositories and ease of use, while also cautioning against potential drawbacks like vendor lock-in, increased complexity, and security concerns. The author encourages developers to carefully evaluate their needs and consider alternative solutions before fully committing to GitHub Actions, emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach to tool selection in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; no way of running actions locallyMy policy is to never let pipeline DSLs contain any actual logic outside orchestration for the task, relying solely on one-liner build or test commands. If the task is more complicated than a one-liner, make a script for it in the repo to make it a one-liner. Doesn't matter if it's GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps (which has super cursed yaml), etc.This in turn means that you can do what the pipeline does with a one-liner too, whether manually, from a vscode launch command, a git hook, etc.This same approach can fix the mess of path-specific validation too - write a regular script (shell, python, JS, whatever you fancy) that checks what has changed and calls the appropriate validation script. The GitHub action is only used to run the script on PR and to prepare the CI container for whatever the script needs, and the same pipeline will always run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh boy, there's a special kind of hell I enter into everytime I set up new github actions. I wrote a blog post a few months ago about my pain[0] but one of the main things I've found over the years is you can massively reduce how horrible writing github actions is by avoiding prebuilt actions, and just using it as a handy shell runner.If you write behaviour in python/ruby/bash/hell-rust-if-you-really-want and leave your github action at `run: python some/script.py` then you'll have something that's much easy to test locally, and save yourself a lot of pain, even if you wind up with slightly more boilerplate.[0] https://benrutter.github.io/posts/github-actions/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of folks in this thread are focusing on the monorepo aspect of things. The "Pull request and required checks" problem exists regardless of monorepo or not.GitHub Actions allows you to only run checks if certain conditions are met, like "only lint markdown if the PR contains *.md files". The moment you decide to use such rules, you have the "Pull request and required checks" problem. No "monorepo" required.GitHub required checks at this time allow you to use with external services where GitHub has no idea what might run. For this reason, required checks HAVE to pass. There's no "if it runs" step. A required check on an external service might never run, or it might be delayed. Therefore, if GH doesn't have an affirmation that it passed, you can't merge.It would be wonderful if for jobs that run on GH where GH can know if the action is supposed to run, if required checks could be "require all these checks if they will be triggered".I have encountered this problem on every non-trivial project I use with GitHub actions; monorepo or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764762</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's reflections on failure and personal growth, emphasizing that failures are not a reflection of one's worth but rather opportunities for learning and development. The author shares personal experiences and insights gained from challenges faced, highlighting the importance of resilience, adaptability, and self-compassion in navigating setbacks. Ultimately, the piece encourages readers to reevaluate their perceptions of failure and view it as an integral part of their journey toward success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This line in the article resonated with me:&gt; First, it sets the stage for what was to come, and second, while it was unquestionably a success, it was not my success.I used to think that success was being successful the way I wanted and I was often frustrated because things were working but not because of the way I wanted them to. Turns out, it's doubly difficult to make things not only work but also work the way I want.I've since tried to be more open-minded and see wins that perhaps I didn't expect or want still as wins and it's made me feel a lot more successful. One might scoff and say I should hold myself to a higher standard, but at the end of the day, success is only an intrinsic feeling anyways. It's not a measurable metric so I might as well feel better about the progress I'm making.In the context of the article, the author could see these all as failures, but it sounds like some of these were pretty successful. In fact, the author concludes as much, finding happiness in the "failures". It's all an arbitrary label anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is currently a risk asymmetry in startup world that drives away people who could do good work.Investors know the long odds of success, so they invest in twenty to thirty companies and wait for one to get big.Founders and employees can't diversify like that, because you only have so many working years. To mitigate this we have decided to award successful founders with huge paydays as a lure to others to throw their hats in the ring. This has some malign effects, namely unsuccessful founders and employees get bupkis. It also attracts the wrong sort of personality to be a founder, selecting for too much risk appetite. (At least what I consider the wrong sort for building a sustainably profitable business.)I have an idea for how to solve this and I wonder if it's already been tried or if there are holes in it. The idea is to spread the risk of starting a company across something like an accelerator class. If one company in that class gets big, it would be contractually obligated to hire and grant shares from some pool to other members of that class. This would be at the cost of the winning founders' stakes.The upside for winners would be much lower, but the downside would be lower too. This would attract a different sort of person to this accelerator, and be a differentiator for selecting talent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My main lesson from running a startup: don't. And if you do, quit when the going gets tough. Perseverance does not pay off.Obviously it doesn't always end badly. But we get a massively skewed view from survivor bias.My life turned out pretty damn well once I got a plain ordinary job working for someone else. But I don't kid myself: when it comes to starting a startup, I did fail. The main lesson I learned was that I was always going to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771676</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the extensive network of bunkers built in Albania during the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, primarily between the 1950s and 1980s. These bunkers, designed for military defense against potential invasions, number in the hundreds of thousands and vary in size and function. After the fall of communism, many of these bunkers became abandoned or repurposed, raising questions about their historical significance and cultural impact. The site highlights their architectural features, strategic purpose, and the ongoing debate regarding their preservation and potential use in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728692"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had never heard of Enver Hoxha until I listened to the episodes about him on the Real Dictators podcast. Very wild stuff. I find it really fascinating and rather sobering that these invasive authoritarian governments can one day take root and control most or all of the rest of your life. I fear that people's complacency or thoughts that "surely it can't happen here" are part of what lets them rise in the first place, and I wonder just how quickly you can find yourself inside of one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Albania, for reasons related to my job I used to travel there multiple times a year until around 2010.Those bunkers are absolutely everywhere, even right in the middle of nowhere (I guess that's useful if you happen to get lost in the wilderness while hiking).In towns and cities they have been sometimes repurposed, e.g. I remember seeing that someone created a small cafe on the beach using one of the larger bunkers.The problem with reusing them is that the vast majority of the bunkers are of the smaller type (mostly below ground level, and on the inside there is barely enough room for a couple of people) and it's hard to find a new purpose for those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah Albanian mason who has been living in Italy since the 90s told me a story about bunkers. I cannot date it to a year nor assess its truth but here it is.A Minister (maybe Defense? Army? whatever) went to check the new bunkers. They looked good but he asked to the chief engineer how he could be sure that Hoxha would be satisfied with them."You know, if he thinks they are not good I'm dead.""They are very good.""So you must get in.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various patterns and best practices for using enums in TypeScript, highlighting the differences between numeric and string enums. It explains how to define and use enums effectively, including examples of both basic and advanced patterns, such as computed enums and enum member types. The article also emphasizes the importance of choosing the right enum type for specific use cases, providing insights into potential pitfalls and alternative approaches. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to leverage enums in TypeScript to enhance code readability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I'm missing in the comments here is that enums are a very early TypeScript feature. They were in there nearly from the start, when the project was still trying to find clarity on its goals and principles.Since then:- TypeScript added string literals and unions, eg `type Status = "Active" | "Inactive"`- TypeScript added `as const`, eg `const Status = { Active: 0, Inactive: 1 } as const`- TypeScript adopted a stance that features should only generate runtime code when it's on a standards trackEnums made some sense back when TS didn't have any of these. They don't really make a lot of sense now. I think they're effectively deprecated, to the point that I wonder why they don't document them as deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After almost a decade of TypeScript my recommendation is to not use TypeScript enums.Enums is going to make your TypeScript code not work in a future where TypeScript code can be run with Node.js or in browser when typings are added to JavaScript[1]Enums results in runtime code and in most cases you really want type enums. Use `type State = "Active" | "Inactive"` and so on instead. And if you really want an closed-ended object use `const State = { Active: 1, Inactive: 0 } as const`All of the examples in the article can be achieved without enums. See https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/PTAEFEA8EMFsAcA2B...[1] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use TypeScript in a way that leaves no TS traces in compiled JS. It means no enums, no namespaces, no private properties, etc.Great list of such features: https://www.totaltypescript.com/books/total-typescript-essen...TS has a great type system, the rest of the language is runtime overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766729</guid></item><item><title>17.

Real-time audio is very computationally intensive, after all.I've tried various embedded scripting languages in Rust, but Rhai probably has the best documentation and playground.For reference, see this survey:https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/09/16/survey-of-rust-embed...Recent Koto Lang also looks promising:https://koto.dev/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not going to dissuade anyone from having fun hobby projects.But legitimate question: why would I choose this over Lua, which is probably faster, super easy to embed and has a larger ecosystem.(Please, saying "Rust" or memory-safety can be assumed already to be understood, but not considered compelling arguments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a bunch of crates available for scripting in Rust/Bevy (Rhai, Rune, Luau, Teal, etc), anyone who've tried specifically Rhai with specifically Bevy before and could share their experience?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738753</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the Byzantine-Sassanian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire from the 4th to the 7th centuries. It highlights key battles, military strategies, and political motivations that fueled these wars, such as territorial disputes and the control of trade routes. The piece also discusses the impact of these wars on both empires, including significant territorial losses and how the prolonged conflict contributed to the eventual rise of Islamic powers in the region. Overall, it emphasizes the historical significance of these conflicts in shaping the geopolitics of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone is interested in Byzantium fall and why this war was so bad for both empires, read some more about Justinian's Plague which killed ~35-50% of population and also halved economical output. It took about 200 years to get to the same place population wise for most of the empire.Weirdly it didn't hit Persia as much outside of Mesopotamia, most historians estimate "only" ~20-30% of population died and shifted balance of power to Persian side, from almost renewed Roman Empire at 540 which most likely was getting back to ruling mediterranean world once again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in learning more about Byzantium there is a fantastic podcast The History of Byzantium[1] that follows on from Mike Duncan's The History of Rome Podcast.[1] https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tom Holland's "Shadow of the Sword" covers this and the broader context. "Justinian's Flea" is set a century earlier, but provides some grimly fascinating background: both these empires were still suffering the economic and demographic consequences of a plague. It's an under appreciated period of history, just as interesting as the Roman civil war imho.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732533</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article “The Two Hard Things” by Martin Fowler discusses the challenges faced in software development, particularly focusing on the complexities of building and maintaining systems that effectively perform difficult tasks. Fowler identifies two major hurdles: the difficulty of coordinating large teams and the continuous management of the evolving architecture of software systems. He emphasizes that while technical challenges can often be resolved with solutions, the social and organizational aspects of software development are more complex and require thoughtful attention to ensure successful outcomes. The piece highlights the importance of understanding these challenges to navigate the intricacies of software engineering effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm partial to this non-jokey take on two hard things:Phil Karlton famously said there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. I gather many folks suppose "naming things" is about whether to use camel-case or not, or picking specific symbols we use to name things, which is obviously trivial and mundane. But I always assumed Karlton meant the problem of making references work: the task of relating intension (names and ideas) and extension (things designated) in a reliable way, which is also the same topic as cache invalidation when that's about when to stop the association once invalid.https://web.archive.org/web/20130805122711/http://lambda-the...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s two hard problems in computer science: cacsynchronizing shared access to the same resource.he invalidation, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always reminds of the JWZ quote regarding regular expressions:&gt;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763592</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Parinfer is a tool designed to enhance the experience of editing Lisp code by automatically adjusting indentation and parentheses in real-time. It simplifies the programming process by allowing users to focus on writing code without worrying excessively about syntax, as it intelligently infers the structure based on either indentation or parentheses. The website provides detailed explanations of how Parinfer works, its various modes, installation instructions, and links to compatible editors, demonstrating its functionality and ease of use for Lisp developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766205"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love innovation in this space, and remember when Parinfer came out having some enlightening discussions with colleagues about how they efficiently edited code.I've since settled on Lispy and Lispyville in Emacs, and have run into very few issues over the past few years.There's something about Lispy’s style of editing that appeals to me — the use of hugging parentheses to enable its bindings, combined with Lispyville making all of my Vim bindings safe, makes me very happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Parinfer with IntelliJ (Cursive) ever since I started developing Clojure professionally back in 2018. The best thing about Parinfer, or at least the implementation in Cursive, is that it doesn't preclude you from also mixing in some Paredit commands too.When you start out with Clojure/Lisp  and you aren't totally used to parenthesis you can just use Parinfer to get editor behaviour similar to developing Python. It removes a major pain point of migrating to a Lisp. It used to be the case that you were forced to learn Paredit pretty much from the start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parinfer was instrumental to me learning Clojure. Paredit felt like operating an airplane cockpit, and Parinfer took that experience and made it much closer to just writing prose, for which I am forever grateful.I remember people, including Rich Hickey, scoffing at it when it came out, which seemed like kind of a snobbish reaction to something that lowers the barriers of entry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766205</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great app! I've been building something similar, but for less advanced language learners, who wouldn't understand definitions in their target language.My app [1] is basically a combination of SRS flashcards with an ebook/YouTube/Website reader. Unlike Anki though, AI creates example sentences, definitions, images and audio.I find it interesting that you want to get inspired by Duolingo. My approach is to have the most efficient grind possible - no gamification. I've found Duolingo was wasting so much of my time with exercises that did not really teach me anything and took a long time to complete + the XP points/levels etc. were quite distracting.[1] https://vocabuo.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, quick suggestion as a PhD Linguistics candidate and avid language learner!The best way I've found to identify vocabulary most important to my life is through journaling in the language I'm trying to learn. Describing exactly what I did that day, my thoughts, etc, as best I can.I had thought of doing the journal entries digitally and gathering dictionary headwords from such journal entries, whether they're written in my mother tongue (English) or not, and use the built dictionary lists to drill vocab.Traditionally you'd use a lemmatizer with a morphosyntactic tagger for the language to identify the dictionary words, but AI is serviceable these days to easily identify dictionary words from long-form text in many languages, though honestly would be surprised if AI outperforms the traditional methods already.Good luck and have fun :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks really good. I wish I had had something like this many years ago when I was studying languages.Somebody has already suggested adding spaced repetition and audio, which I agree with completely.One more suggestion: In addition to having the LLM give you the meaning and example for the context in which you originally saw the word, also ask it to provide the word’s other main meanings and examples of it being used in those senses. You might encounter a word first in a slang or technical sense; while it’s useful to learn that meaning, it’s also important to learn other, more common meanings.Below are some examples of words you might encounter first in technical contexts but would also be worth knowing in their more general meanings. (Examples suggested and defined by ChatGPT o1.)canonicalReligious/General: Relating to a canon (e.g., church law) or a recognized body of works.Math/Computing: Conforming to a standard or simplest form (e.g., “canonical form” of an equation).resolutionGeneral: A firm decision or determination (often heard in “New Year’s resolution”).Tech/Imaging: The detail an image holds, typically measured in pixels, dots per inch (DPI), etc.protocolDiplomatic/General: The official procedure or set of rules governing state or ceremonial events.Computing: A set of conventions and rules for transmitting data between electronic devices.fluxGeneral: Continuous movement or change, often implying instability.Physics/Engineering: The amount of some quantity (e.g., heat, magnetism) passing through a given area over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770200</guid></item><item><title>22.

Doubly boneheaded considering the graphics API they developed, Vulkan, literally does that via SPIR-V!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can understand wanting to prioritize support for the cards people want to use most, but they should still plan to write software support for all the cards that have hardware support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772170</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started cooking ice cream this summer. I bought an ice cream machine that can yield 1L of ice cream in 30 minutes, and prepared about 30L, sometimes sourcing material from the garden (strawberries, raspberries, cherries, figs and blackberries). If you enjoy the taste of fresh figs (which I don't normally because of the texture of the fruit) it is an incredible way to preserve it.The best ice cream I made was blueberry + coco cream + lime. Highly recommend it. Coco cream as a substitute for water in sorbet is an amazing trick.Shared this with a friend yesterday:    1. **Creaminess (smooth, creamy texture)**  
    Creaminess ↑ ⇔ Cream ↑ + Eggs ↑ + Sugar ↑  
    Creaminess ↓ ⇔ Water ↑ + Fresh fruits (high in water) ↑  
    
    2. **Lightness (airy texture)**  
    Lightness ↑ ⇔ Milk ↓ + Cream ↓ + Eggs ↓ + Sugar ↓  
    Lightness ↑ ⇔ Air incorporation (whipping) ↑  
    
    3. **Stability (avoiding crystallization)**  
    Stability ↑ ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Eggs (yolks) ↑ + Alcohol ↑  
    Stability ↓ ⇔ Water ↑ + Uneven freezing temperature ↑  
    
    4. **Density (weight in the mouth)**  
    Density ↑ ⇔ Fats (cream, butter) ↑ + Eggs ↑ + Sugar ↑  
    Density ↓ ⇔ Incorporated air ↑ + Water ↑  
    
    5. **Melting Temperature (softer or harder out of the freezer)**  
    Melting Temperature ↑ (softer) ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Alcohol ↑ + Air ↑  
    Melting Temperature ↓ (harder) ⇔ Water ↑ + Freezing temperature ↓  
    
    6. **Sweetness (perceived sugar)**  
    Sweetness ↑ ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Sweet fruit puree ↑  
    Sweetness ↓ ⇔ Acidity (lemon, vinegar) ↑ + Acidic fruits ↑  
    
    7. **Crystallization (grainy or smooth texture)**  
    Crystallization ↑ ⇔ Water ↑ + Poorly mixed ingredients ↑  
    Crystallization ↓ ⇔ Fats ↑ + Sugar ↑ + Proper agitation ↑&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best ice cream recipe ever I got from a physicist:Cream + sugar + vanilla, stir until dissolved. Slowly add liquid nitrogen while stirring fervently until sufficiently frozen.The stirring in of the liquid nitrogen not only freezes the cream, it prevents any cristallisation and fluffs up the ice cream by evaporating. Truly delicious!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic Ben&amp; Jerry's recipe in an ice cream machine is pretty much unbeatable if you're looking for traditional ice cream. On the other hand, I've tried, without much luck, lower calorie ice creams using substitute sugars like allulose. Unfortunately, they haven't turned out very well. It really is the combination of real sugar, fat, protein, and all that that comes together in the cold to make the magic happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724323</guid></item><item><title>24.

I-line refers to a specific wavelength of UV light—365nm, and the stepper is the machine that focuses it on the silicon wafer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not clear to me where the novelty is in this... people have been doing similar stuff for ages, and the performance of the optics here leaves a bit to be desired as well.Sure we can mass produce these, but we can also mass produce wafer-scale lenses, and in any serious application, a normal metamaterial lens would justify the higher cost with its performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737401</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Authors are requesting Meta to provide access to their torrent client logs and seeding data as part of an investigation into the illegal distribution of their works through AI platforms. The initiative is aimed at combatting piracy, as the authors believe that Meta's data could help identify individuals involved in sharing their content without permission. This legal action highlights the ongoing struggle between copyright holders and those who utilize technology to share or access copyrighted material unlawfully.&lt;/p&gt;

There's just no other viable alternative for efficiently acquiring large quantities of text data. Buying millions of ebooks online would take a lot of effort, downloading data from publishers isn't a thing that can be done efficiently (assuming tech companies negotiated and threw money at them), the only efficient way to access large volumes of media is piracy.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports that the Netherlands has agreed to align its export controls on certain advanced chip equipment with those of the United States, specifically targeting technologies produced by ASML Holdings. This move is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to restrict China's access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology, thereby ensuring that critical technologies do not enhance China’s military capabilities. The Dutch government's decision reflects increased international cooperation on technology exports amid rising geopolitical tensions and a global push to safeguard semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ASML is so interesting. Its like sci-fi that one firm in the Netherlands knows how to make the most complicated machine ever made, and no one else can do it.And it is arguably the most complicated machine ever made. 50,000 times a second, the EUV lithography machine hits a 25 micron drop of molten tin that is moving at 70 meters per second with two co-ordinated lasers, the first hit to change the shape of the drop of tin in exactly the right way, the second hit to vaporise it, creating Extreme Ultraviolet Light at the right wavelength to etch chip designs onto silicon at "5nm process" sizes. Some labs can cobble together something similar as a proof of concept, but not well enough to make it feasible for mass production of chips.Video about the light souce - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ge2RcvDlgwNo one else in the world is able to make these machines. If you buy one it costs $150m and gets shipped to you in forty containers on specially adapted planes. Very few firms have the resources/know how to even run the machines - which is what makes TSMC so important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I regret to inform the various nationalists here this wasn't really developed by one group.  ASML signed contracts for research and technology from multiple different countries.  The Netherlands isn't being strong armed here.  It is having to comply with a heavily negotiated contract that they signed decades ago when they aquired a US based firm using export controlled US DOE research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And what are ASML and the Netherlands in general getting out of it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42729488</guid></item><item><title>30.

We considered something like “Sp” or “P” but one founder made the suggestion of using “X” since it's a common variable name in programming and thus makes sense since the name “Y Combinator” itself is a programming term.This chain of reasoning seems totally disconnected? "While trying to come up with a single letter to denote spring, since S was taken, we decided on... a common variable name instead" ??? what happened to denoting spring in there? Am I missing some clever reference? Is spring in particular the season for common variables?The spring constant (in physics) is denoted by the letter "k", why not use that? I know its not programming, but at least it denotes spring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;V25, the Vernal YC 2025 batch!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770629</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the meaning of the message "supports DRM functions and may not be fully accessible" in the context of SATA (Serial ATA) devices. It explains that this message indicates that while the SATA drive has capabilities related to Digital Rights Management (DRM), access to all functionalities may be restricted or limited. The discussion includes potential reasons for this limitation, such as hardware restrictions or manufacturer implementations, and emphasizes the importance of understanding this message for users dealing with SATA storage devices, particularly in scenarios involving operating system installations and data accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think in this very case it has anything to do with digital rights management. It detects an Intel SATA SSD, SSDSCKJF360A5L a disk that supports ATA Trusted Send/Receive commands used to interface with on-disk encryption features. Specifically 5B to 5F (reference: https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_Command_Matrix).To make things even more confusing, kernel refers to the command between 5C and 5F with the acronym TPM, and requires `libata.allow_tpm=1` command line parameter to be passed to allow issuing them. (kernel source reference: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/drivers/ata/lib...), which has _nothing to do_ with the trusted platform module TPM, just another TLA clash.Here's the original commit from 2008. The naming is very likely through misassociation. TCG: Trusted Computing Group is most known for creating TPM specification. Another thing they work on is the OPAL specification for self encrypting drives. Author possibly clumped them into the same thing. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ae8d4ee7ff429136c8b...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The S in SD stands for secure, and can be used for DRM purposes as well.Windows Phone 7 is the only one I know of that used it: https://web.archive.org/web/20110219215401/http://support.mi...Once the SD card was bonded to your phone it was not reuseable elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So... one more reason to not buy the content and pirate it instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42765480</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brother acquired an aging app (from an aging founder) built on Delphi used by many dozens (or low hundred) of the world’s leading shipping, energy and commodities companies, used as a standard to calculate “laytime” and “demurge” (myriad of fees associated when a ship docks into a port). It used to cost $5k for a perpetual license tied to usb based key that had to be plugged in to activate. If you wanted to use on two machines, you had to buy two licenses with two keys.Customers in the US and Europe hated the usb, especially during COVID. In random places of Africa, where they greatly valued the single perpetual license, it persists. From my perspective, I don’t see anything positive from being an installed application for this use case - he had to hop through so many security hoops that when he rolled out the web solution IT departments breathed a huge sigh of relief and thanked him.Over a period of about 2 years he converted almost everyone to saas and 4x’d the annual revenue. That also generated enough fcf to hire more developers to ship more features.Saas is generally the way to go. Installed apps are common in financial services and industrial applications. I can think of a bunch of other niche examples but I personally would never pursue this model. We put bugs into production from time to time and it is nice to be able to instantly roll out updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legal changes are making it increasingly very difficult to sell perpetual licenses.  For example, in Germany, a new law recently took effect that clarifies that if you sell a software license for a given period of time, you're liable to provide whatever updates/support the customer may need over the course of the software's licensing period to enable the customer to keep running it, at no additional cost, regardless of what it costs you.  I'm not a lawyer and may be getting this wrong, but if you're contemplating getting into the business of selling perpetual licenses in software, definitely check with a lawyer.  It's not like it was in the 90s.In the 90s, a large driver of recurring revenue for software was that when the OS and hardware landscape changed, you made a new version of the software adapted to that change, and then, if customers wanted to upgrade their OS or hardware (frequently for reasons unrelated to your product), that made them come back to you to pay for the new version of your product.  Under the new legal regime, you would be forced to give them the update for free, so if you sell an actual perpetual software license, you have a fixed amount of revenue on one hand, and a potentially unlimited liability to incur additional costs on the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jetbrains is still selling their IDE using old method as well as new. You can buy perpetual license but if you want upgrades, you pay again. That's how I bought my Clion and still use it personally from time to time. Buying a plan for me is too expensive - I do tinkering at home rarely. The same with any Photoshop or Lightroom - I bought a last available license and won't buy the cloud version especially because it has exit fees.Minecraft - having huge community - still sells lifetime license with upgrades. I wouldn't pay for it monthly neither.I also bought some software like GuitarTuna perpetual license and they turned it off (the possibility of buying it that way) but I still use it this way (despite they used to nag me to pay monthly). The problem is that one private person cannot hold to many subscriptions. It's killing the budget. Keep this in mind. Also companies tend to switch to cheaper subscriptions after they calculated where did they go in terms of monthly payments.I know I didn't answer your question because my perspective is different, but I wanted to highlight the other side of the deal. If you want $$$$ go for it. If you have a mission or want to gather community or you want small people to use it from time to time - maybe hybrid both solutions is the way to go?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764185</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Alligator Eggs" explores the concept of self-organizing systems and emergent behavior, using the example of alligator nesting and how temperature-dependent sex determination in eggs results in varying numbers of male and female alligators. It discusses how environmental factors influence the development of these animals and emphasizes the interconnectedness of biological processes with ecological dynamics. Through this lens, it highlights broader themes of complexity in nature and the ways systems can spontaneously organize to produce diverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation and development of Community Notes, a platform that allows users to collaboratively contribute notes and context to online content, enhancing user understanding and engagement. It details the motivations behind the initiative, the collaborative process involving various stakeholders, and the innovative features of Community Notes that ensure transparency and reliability. The piece emphasizes the importance of community involvement in shaping digital discourse and improving information accuracy online.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a very interesting design space. How to design public forums where people can share ideas and eventually improve their knowledge collectively.There are very successful instances of that, for instance MathOverflow.But I don't know what can be achieved when a good chunk of participants don't agree on some basic rules beforehand, such as logic and good faith. It's a bit like consensus with byzantine failures, maybe there's an impossibility theorem here and large social network should be limited to cat videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven't read the entire interview yet, but I have to say so far it has been very helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a useful piece, thanks for posting it.Flagging of misinformation has become a controversial topic but for me personally it strikes me as odd to even do such a thing at all. Or rather, if there's a need for such a system it suggests the platform has already failed, in that people are not able to use it discerningly, whether because of the posters, readers, system, or some interaction thereof. If they are able to do so, why have it?I've posted this elsewhere but the nature of community notes makes it a bit murkier. If Platform A introduces misinformation flags, you can always compartmentalize it as the platform inserting itself into the conversation one way or another, but with something like community notes, you're left wondering at some level "what happened here?" in a way that's similar to upvotes or downvotes.The point about people trusting community notes I'm not sure what to do with either. Other studies I've seen cited elsewhere suggest that there's a very high false negative rate, so are they doing what they're supposed to? How are people interpreting the unflagged posts?The whole thing seems well-intended at some level but also missing the forest for the trees or something. I don't want community notes or misinformation flags, I just want discourse and I want to be able to ignore certain sources of posts and be more exposed to others.It's an interesting idea and I'm not even sure I'm objecting to its implementation. I guess it's more so that I feel like there's an overconfidence in all of the misinformation flagging methods, and this overconfidence is maybe taking attention away from more serious problems, like how people consume and evaluate information, or how information networks are being controlled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772518</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;Blinkenlights refers to a nostalgic installation that recreates the visual and auditory aesthetic of early computer systems using light displays. Originally popularized in the late 1990s, Blinkenlights projects were often set up in large urban environments, transforming buildings into giant interactive displays. The term itself also embodies the early computer jargon, used to describe the blinking lights on equipment that conveyed the status and activity of the machines. The projects often engage the public through interactive elements and serve as a playful homage to the history of computing and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have fond memories of soldering my own small Blinkenlight, a BlinkenLED, around 2005 as a kid. This was before the Raspberry Pi was around - it was just a 10x20 LED matrix controlled by 20 shift registers [0], connected to the serial port of an old DOS laptop. I remember that it was trivial to shift the individual bits through the serial port with a small BASIC program.Soldering this thing, however, was a challenge. It was basically 200 LEDs on a perfboard, the cathodes all connected by a continuous strip of non-isolated wire (I think I used paper clips for that), and the anodes all individually connected to the shift register output pins via flexible wires. It took me several weeks to finish this with a cheap 10 EUR soldering iron from my local hardware store, and it did not look nice from the back.It worked very reliable, however, and I used it to display the time, the date and some small animations for some years.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought went to Project Blinkenlights https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blinkenlights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have one of these [0]; it's fun and a good topic of conversation when we have visitors over.[0] https://www.tindie.com/products/obso/pdp-11-replica-kit-the-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728392</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked, fortunately briefly, in Apple’s AI/ML organization.It was difficult to believe the overhead, inefficiency, and cruft. Status updates in a wiki page tens of thousands of words long in tables too large and ill-formatted for anyone to possibly glean. Several teams clamboring to work on the latest hot topic for that year’s WWDC — in my year it was “privacy-preserving ML”. At least four of five teams that I knew of.They have too much money and don’t want to do layoffs because they’re afraid of leaks, so they just keep people around forever doing next to nothing, since it’s their brand and high-margin hardware that drives the business. It was baked into the Apple culture to “go with the flow”, a refrain I heard many times, which I understood to mean stand-by and pretend to be busy while layers of bureaucracy obscure the fact that a solid half of the engineers could vanish to very little detriment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am probably suffering confirmation bias. But that said, this LLM smartness continues to be impressively shit. There's a level of "yea that's cool" but it's outweighed by "that'd be wrong, and suggests you understand nothing about me or my data"It's a little (ok a lot) like targeted ads. I'll believe it's targeted when it tries to sell me ancillary, related goods for e.g. that fridge freezer I bought, not show me ads for fridge freezer  I now don't need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how long it will take for "guaranteed AI-free!" to become a serious marketing argument for some products or services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744785</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the discovery of thriving microbial life deep within the Earth's subsurface, revealing that these organisms could be living several miles below the surface in environments previously thought to be uninhabitable. It discusses the significance of these findings for understanding life's resilience and adaptability, as well as their implications for astrobiology in the search for extraterrestrial life. The research highlights the complex ecosystems that exist in these depths, driven by geothermal energy and chemical processes, suggesting that much of Earth's biodiversity is still hidden underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildfires in California are significantly undermining the state's climate progress, according to research by scientists at the University of Chicago. The study reveals that the increase in wildfire incidents since the early 2000s has not only released vast amounts of carbon dioxide but also harmed the long-term carbon storage capacity of forests. This erosion of climate gains poses a challenge to California's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate resilience. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved forest management and fire prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of wildfires on climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should make prescribed forest burns a high priority- they burn the forest floor but spare the large trees- smoothing out carbon release.There’s evidence that prescribed burns may lead to less carbon emissions [1].In chaparral regions like the LA fires, prescribed burns might not help with carbon emissions. And for fire suppression I suspect there’s only so much that can be done to be responsive enough to recent hydrology changes.[1] https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=116626&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wildfire carbon emissions are very different from fossil fuel carbon emissions. Wildfires are releasing carbon that trees and other vegetation pulled out of the atmosphere in the relatively recent past. It's carbon-neutral for the same reason that burning firewood to heat your home is carbon-neutral.Fossil fuel carbon emissions are releasing carbon that has been sequestered for millions of years. It's a net increase in current atmospheric carbon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only really makes sense to say, if the wildfire are a result of climate policy. Which this article doesn't seem to be claiming.Also I don't think the stuff that burns in these would have otherwise ended up buried/fossilized, so maybe it shouldn't actually count at all?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762813</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The document N3317 presents a proposal for the C programming language, focused on enhancing and formalizing the C standard to improve language clarity and functionality. It discusses changes and updates to various aspects of the language, including data types, memory management, and standard library functions.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of this. The suggested effects have some ambiguities. For example, does sprintf imply the errno effect that's only required under POSIX? Does printf imply file or just system depending on implementation?I'm also not sure what you really gain from this effort beyond mut annotations. It doesn't give you a way to detect or eliminate UB. It doesn't allow the compiler to optimize pure functions better like the reproducible directive does. A better effects system could do these things, but this is an unhappy middle ground between something simple enough to actually get standardized and something powerful enough to provide useful guarantees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See also:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41464994 - C2y Proposal: Essential Effects for C (2024-09-06, 30 comments)Is there a corresponding proposal for C++?

&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that Pluto's largest moon, Charon, may have formed from a "kiss and capture" event, where Pluto and another celestial body collided, allowing Charon to be captured by Pluto's gravity. This theory challenges previous understandings of Charon's origin, proposing that it resulted from a less violent interaction than once thought, adding depth to the study of celestial mechanics and how moons can form around dwarf planets.&lt;/p&gt;

These were the first soil composition measurements ever registered from near the moon’s south pole, and the scientists found that all of them included ferroan anorthosite, a type of white rock.""That finding supports the idea that the moon was once enveloped by magma. “A key prediction of the lunar magma ocean hypothesis is the presence of a largely anorthositic crust,” Vadawale tells Popular Science’s Tom Hawking. This is because during the moon’s magma ocean phase, dense rocks—like magnesium-rich mafic rocks—would have sunk inward, while lighter rocks—like ferroan anorthosite—would have floated to the top."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753542</guid></item><item><title>49.

It emphasizes the importance of developing this skill in order to cope effectively with challenges, both in personal and professional settings. The piece outlines various strategies for improving frustration tolerance, such as mindfulness practices, cognitive restructuring, and setting realistic goals. It encourages readers to view frustrations as opportunities for growth and resilience, ultimately fostering a healthier mindset and greater emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I  learned that the world of men as it exists today is a bureaucracy. This is an obvious truth, of course, though it is also one the ignorance of which causes great suffering.“But moreover, I discovered, in the only way that a man ever really learns anything important, the real skill that is required to succeed in a bureaucracy. I mean really succeed: do good, make a difference, serve. I discovered the key. This key is not efficiency, or probity, or insight, or wisdom. It is not political cunning, interpersonal skills, raw IQ, loyalty, vision, or any of the qualities that the bureaucratic world calls virtues, and tests for. The key is a certain capacity that underlies all these qualities, rather the way that an ability to breathe and pump blood underlies all thought and action.“The underlying bureaucratic key is the ability to deal with boredom. To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breathe, so to speak, without air.“The key is the ability, whether innate or conditioned, to find the other side of the rote, the picayune, the meaningless, the repetitive, the pointlessly complex. To be, in a word, unborable.“It is the key to modern life. If you are immune to boredom, there is literally nothing you cannot accomplish.David Foster Wallace, The Pale King&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having an organisation of highly-frustration-tollerant people is a great way of getting an organisation where nothing ever gets fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things I often find missing in articles and discussion of these topics here on HN is the understanding that different people are really quite different.Articles or comments like this often read like moral judgements. You should be X to succeed. Being X works for me, and it should for you. If X doesn't work for you, it's your problem. There's usually little considering that achieving X may be significantly easier for some than others, or that there may be other ways of achieving a persons goals that work better for them.This article is better than most in that it has a well defined scope, large organizations. I don't have any major problems with the content, other than I'd like some more time spent on wether the model they are applying is really as applicable to the situation as they claim.I must admit to some bias, as I do no do well in large organizations, and the description of frustration in the article doesn't resonate with my experience of frustration at these orgs. I left the last place I worked because it was bad for my mental health. In many ways it was a dream job. It payed extremely well, I liked the people I worked with, and it wasn't that hard. Eventually though, I just couldn't do it anymore, and left for a small startup. I didn't realize how bad it was until I noticed I could still feel myself physically unwinding three months later.I've been at this company for three years, and still love working here. It's absolutely not frustration free. I am however, much better equipped to handle the kinds of frustrations I face at this new company.The author of the article says:"It’s like learning to navigate a bustling city. At first, the traffic, noise, and crowds seem like overwhelming obstacles. But over time, you see these elements as essential aspects of urban life."I've experienced this first hand after moving to NYC, and it's true, but it's also important to remember that some people just don't like cities, and that's Ok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770986</guid></item><item><title>1. 0-click deanonymization attack targeting Signal, Discord, other platforms</title><link>https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/45a3cdfa52246f1d1201c1e8cdef6117</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a basic web application using the Flask framework in Python. It covers the installation of necessary tools, setting up the Flask environment, creating a simple application structure, and writing code to handle routes and templates. The guide emphasizes best practices in organizing code and includes examples for rendering HTML, handling form submissions, and displaying dynamic content, making it a useful resource for beginners looking to learn web development with Flask.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So if you send a picture to a Signal user, it's retrieved via cloudflare, and cached in a data center near that user; now you can look up the cache status and find the data center used. I'd say "deanonymization" is stretching it, unless the user is in the middle of nowhere (no other users near the data center). But interesting writeup anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool writeup with some interesting techniques and approaches!I'll echo the other comments and say "deanonymization" is stretching the definition of the word, along with "grab the user's location", as it isn't anything near precise. 150 miles is approx. a 2-hour drive on the highway from Atlanta, GA to Augusta, GA. In that radius, there's probably 700,000+ people.I do think the auto-retrieve attachment feature of Signal is slightly concerning, as for a private messenger I'd expect there to be an option to turn it off (like turning off JS in Tor). I don't know if I'm not looking deep enough, but there doesn't seem to be a feature for that.Signal appears to take a useful-by-default approach that balances privacy and ease-of-use in order to encourage adoption by the masses, I'd assume most people that are really concerned are hardening Signal, similar to what is in this guide: https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2022/07/07/signal-con... . They've always recommended a VPN / proxy + a modification of settings for more high-security scenarios.Caching isn't going anywhere, and neither is CloudFlare. The DoSing days of old in P2P multiplayer lobbies with exposed IPs seemed to carry more of a threat than this, CloudFlare's response seems to be the best out of the 3. Caching sensitive information is never recommended and the onus is on the application doing the communicating to tell their CDN / middle-service to not cache specific items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! Contrary to some of the other posters I think this definitely counts as deanonymization, or at least is close enough. How anonymous would satoshi be today if we had his location to within 250 miles?Repeated applications of this attack (maybe disguised somehow?) could let you track someone’s travel over time, and it is usually only takes 4-5 zip code sized locations to uniquely identify someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:02:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780816</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a technical analysis of the TAC-1 firearm, specifically focusing on its design and functionality for potential reverse engineering and modding. It highlights the components of the TAC-1, including mechanisms and operational characteristics, and provides insights into how these aspects can be altered or improved. The piece includes detailed illustrations and step-by-step explanations to facilitate understanding for those interested in firearms modification, while also addressing safety considerations and best practices for such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I experienced the trust factor (banning, w/o banning officially) issues on my Linux CS:GO account in 2021, dropping to yellow and then red. This made it difficult to find teammates, as I was constantly matched with cheaters.I discovered I wasn't alone, as many other Linux users with Radeon GPUs and 16GB+ VRAM were experiencing similar problems. We created a GitHub issue to track the problem and try to find a solution: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630After some investigation, we found that Valve was punishing Linux users with certain hardware configurations (radeon cards with &gt;=16GB of VRAM, which were quite new at this time).Eventually, after a user reached out to gaben directly, the issue was fixed: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630#...I suspect this was because Valve was preparing to launch the Steam Deck, and gaben wanted to ensure that Linux users had better experience with the device (just a guess).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheating is ultimately a human problem. You can have some safeguards and heuristics like the ones the article describe, to weed out 90% the most blatant cheaters, so I think anticheats like these are fundamentally a good thing. But the anti-cheat can and should err on the safe side because ultimately it should be the players and admins themselves that sort this out.Online multiplayer games must (yes must) take place on servers with human admins. Admins should be present for a majority of the time any players are playing.Ideally with admins the players recognize. Bonus points if players themselves can perform some moderation when no admin is present (votekick, voteban etc). There is no difference between kicking cheaters and kicking people who are abusing chat etc.  Obviously this means that "private" or "community" servers are the only viable types of server for online multiplayer games.This process of policing cheaters and other abuse can not be something that is done via a reporting system and handled asynchronously. Kicking/banning must be done by the admins of the game, and it must be handled quickly.If you are considering buying/playing an online multiplayer game and it doesn't have this functionality (e.g. the only way to play online is via matchmaking on servers set up by the publisher, and the only way cheaters and chat abusers are policed is via some web form) then please, avoid that game.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a remarkable 417-megapixel panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy, which took over a decade to create. The project involved capturing thousands of images to stitch together a detailed view of the galaxy, showcasing intricate details and features not visible to the naked eye. The final image provides a stunning visual representation of Andromeda, highlighting the dedication and effort put into this long-term astronomical endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mandatory recommendation of the Gigapixels of Andromeda [4K] [1] video/version. Especially with this particular song(!), as the 8K version [2] has a different one which doesn't really give the chills... Although, 60fps makes the image much better. Maybe combine the song from [1] with the video from [2]...The source picture is the 1.5 gigapixels version (69.536 x 22.230 pixels).Fun fact: watching the video on certain TV's makes them flicker wildly. Probably because they struggle with many dots in motion. On a monitor it works flawlessly.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9bNqBeAtC8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how come the original post by NASA was seen be fewer people here on HN:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731686I guess it has to do with the time and day of posting something, on how much it will be upvoted and hopefully rise out of the new posts pit :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never seen Andromeda, even when I was in a deep dark sky area and could remember where to look.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses former President Donald Trump's views on artificial intelligence, specifically criticizing companies like OpenAI for their AI advancements, which he perceives as a threat to the workforce and society. Trump emphasizes the need for America to lead in AI development and suggests that regulations may be necessary to ensure its safe use. The piece also highlights the ongoing competition in the AI sector among major tech firms, including OpenAI, Oracle, and investments from entities like SoftBank, and frames the dialogue around the future implications of AI technology on jobs and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

On this 5-year-old laptop running firefox on windows, the loader animations are prone to stuttering jank.  Perhaps this is just the nature of running an animation through a react reconciler, but also these loaders should be able to go around react without invoking a render function or reconciler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for posting this, I like it very much.Furthermore, I would like to see a simple email client written using it, which can be controlled using only the keyboard (on mobile devices) or with the mouse (when at home).

Base16 would likely be enough given the web has opacity and a bunch of other ways to slightly modify colors. I'd also like to see how much of this doesn't need to be React™, even if your application is entirely React.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses unusual and intriguing phenomena related to electric walls, particularly the effects of high-voltage and electric fields on various materials and living beings. It explores the scientific principles underlying these phenomena, including the behavior of electrons and ionization, and how these factors contribute to the creation of electric fields. Additionally, the piece shares anecdotal experiences and visual illustrations to engage the reader's curiosity about the intersection of electricity and its unusual interactions with common objects. Overall, it aims to educate readers on the fascinating aspects of electricity that are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the time I turned myself into a Van de Graff generator at work.I was a theater projectionist, back when you had 20 minute reels you had to constantly change, while babysitting two high-voltage, water-cooled, carbon arc projectors. Sometimes the film would break and you’d have to splice it. So when the theater got a print in, you had to count and log the number of splices for each reel, then the next theater would do the same and retire the print when it got too spliced up (plus, sometimes if it was the last night of a run, some lazy projectionists would splice it in place with masking tape and then you’d have to fix it). Sometimes you had to splice in new trailers or remove inappropriate ones as well.Anyway, you counted splices by rapidly winding through the reel with a benchtop motor with a speed control belted to a takeup reel while the source spun freely. Then, while letting the film slide between your fingers, counting each “bump” you felt as it wound through. I was told to ground myself by touching the metal switch plate of the speed control knob with my other hand. One night I forgot and let go until my hair started rising. I’d gone through most of the reel at a very high speed and acquired its charge.I reached for the switch plate and shot an 8-10” arcing discharge between the plate and my fingers.Lesson learned, I held the switch plate from then on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually work with high voltage for a living, and I have high skepticism about this story. While it is technically possible if you work out the math and somehow get an extremely dense e-field flux, from a practical standpoint it might well be impossible. HV like they describe, especially in high humidity, really likes to equalize itself in a big flash.I strongly suspect instead is that there was a spot where you could really feel the e-field, and people just through rumor and story telling morphed it into "the wall".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ever notice how UFO and Bigfoot sightings mostly went away once everyone had a 4K60 video camera in their pockets?One thread about this in 1995, and then the phenomenon is never seen nor heard about again . . .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42782914</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/E5aqe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is only surprising if you expect that every postdoc should stay in academia, or would want to. Being in academia is not the only way to do research, and is not a prerequisite to using your degree. The private sector is a thing, and postdocs leaving academia can do perfectly good work in their field while actually making a grown up salary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not surprising. I quit after about a year. I could have stayed on but I realized that it just wasn't right for me. By then I had figured out that most research is done by post docs and phd students and it doesn't pay very well. Not that I cared about the money but I started thinking about what is next and did not like the perspective.Professors are basically there to manage the process and haggle for funding. They tend to not be very hands-on with research for the simple reason that that's not their main job. They mostly delegate that to people in their team.And you can only become a professor by doing post docs, landing some tenured position and then maybe they'll make you a professor somewhere. It's a long, uncertain process and the failure modes are basically ending up with a teaching position or being otherwise stuck in some faculty mostly not doing research. Nothing wrong with that. But not what I was after. And a lot of teachers in university are basically people that dropped out of the process somehow.Anyway, the whole management thing had no appeal to me: I did not want to be a manager managing other people doing all the fun stuff (research) while basically dealing with a lot of bureaucratic shit. Not my idea of fun, at least.So, I left. It was the only logical thing to do. I worked for Nokia Research for a while after that. But the career paths there weren't a whole lot different there. And the whole thing started imploding a bit after the iphone launch.These days I do startups and a bit of consulting. Mostly as a CTO, and I'm very hands on which is just how I like it. Inevitably, there's a bit of management involved as well. But I like what I do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777193</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fascination with certain prime numbers, which are so memorable that they capture the interest of both mathematicians and enthusiasts. It highlights how specific primes, like the first few hundred or those with unique properties, attract attention and even lead individuals to actively search for them. The piece explores the psychological aspects of why people find these numbers significant and the cultural or mathematical value they hold in various contexts. Overall, it emphasizes the intersection of human curiosity and mathematical discovery regarding prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you were around in the 80's and 90's you might have already memorized the prime 8675309 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny).  It's also a twin prime, so you can add 2 to get another prime (8675311).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My family’s phone number when I was a child was both a palindrome and a prime: 7984897.My parents had had the number for two decades without noticing it was a palindrome. I still remember my father’s delight when he got off a phone call with a friend: “Doug just said, ‘Hey, I dialed your number backwards and it was still you who answered.’ I never noticed that before!”A few years later, around 1973, one of the other math nerds at my high school liked to factor seven-digit phone numbers by hand just for fun. I was then taking a programming class—Fortran IV, punch cards—and one of my self-initiated projects was to write a prime factoring program. I got the program to work, and, inspired by my friend, I started factoring various phone numbers. Imagine my own delight when I learned that my home phone number was not only a palindrome but also prime.Postscript: The reason we hadn’t noticed that 7984897 was a palindrome was because, until around 1970, phone numbers in our area were written and spoken with the telephone exchange name [1]. When I was small, I learned our phone number as “SYcamore 8 4 8 9 7” or “S Y 8 4 8 9 7.” We thought of the first two digits as letters, not as numbers.Second postscript: I lost contact with that prime-factoring friend after high school. I see now that she went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, specialized in number theory, and had an Erdős number of 1. In 1985, she published a paper titled “How Often Is the Number of Divisors of n a Divisor of n?” [2]. She died two years ago, at the age of sixty-six [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange_names[2] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022314X85...[3] https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/claudia...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belphegor%27s_prime"666" with 13 0's on either side and 1's on the ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748691</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built an Excel Add-In that allows my girlfriend to quickly filter 7000 paper titles and abstracts for a review paper that she is writing [1]. It uses Gemma 2 2b which is a wonderful little model that can run on her laptop CPU. It works surprisingly well for this kind of binary classification task.The nice thing is that she can copy/paste the titles and abstracts in to two columns and write e.g. "=PROMPT(A1:B1, "If the paper studies diabetic neuropathy and stroke, return 'Include', otherwise return 'Exclude'")" and then drag down the formula across 7000 rows to bulk process the data on her own because it's just Excel. There is a gif on the readme on the Github repo that shows it.[1] https://github.com/getcellm/cellm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have ollama responding to SMS spam texts.  I told it to feign interest in whatever the spammer is selling/buying.  Each number gets its own persona, like a millennial gymbro or 19th century British gentleman.http://files.widloski.com/image10%20(1).pnghttp://files.widloski.com/image11.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Llama models to identify cookie notices on websites, for the purpose of adding filter rules to block them in EasyList Cookie. Otherwise, this is normally done by, essentially, manual volunteer reporting.Most cookie notices turn out to be pretty similar, HTML/CSS-wise, and then you can grab their `innerText` and filter out false positives with a small LLM. I've found the 3B models have decent performance on this task, given enough prompt engineering. They do fall apart slightly around edge cases like less common languages or combined cookie notice + age restriction banners. 7B has a negligible false-positive rate without much extra cost. Either way these things are really fast and it's amazing to see reports streaming in during a crawl with no human effort required.Code is at https://github.com/brave/cookiemonster. You can see the prompt at https://github.com/brave/cookiemonster/blob/main/src/text-cl....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784365</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This stands to reason. If you need the answer to a question, and you can either get it directly, or spend time researching the answer, you're going to learn much more with the latter approach than the former.
You may be disciplined enough to do more research if the answer is directly presented to you, but most people will not do that, and most companies are not interested in that, they want quick 'efficient', 'competitive' solutions. They aren't considering the long term downside to this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two aspects to this from my pov. And I think it might be controversial.When i have a question about any topic, and I ask Chatgpt, i usually chat about more things, coming up with questions based on the answer, and mostly stupid questions. I feel like I am taking in the information, analyzing, and then diving deeper because I am curious. This is based on how I learn about stuff. I know i need to check a few things, and that it's not fully accurate, but the conversation flows in a direction I like.compared this to researching on the internet, there are some good aspects, but more often than not, I end up reading an opinionated post by someone (no matter the topic, if you go deep enough, you will land on an opinionated factual telling). That feels like someone decided what questions are important, what angles we need to look at, and what the conclusion should be. Yes, it is educational, but I am always left with lingering questions.The difference is curiosity. If people are curious about a topic, they will learn. If not, they are happy with the answer. And that is not laziness. You cannot be curious about everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been calling this out since OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT.The danger in ubiquitously available LLMs, which seemingly have an answer to any question, isn’t necessarily their existence.The real danger lies in their seductive nature - over how tempting it becomes to immediately reach for the nearest LLM to provide an answer rather than taking a few moments to quietly ponder the problem on your own. That act of manipulating the problem in your head—critical thinking—is ultimately a craft. And the only way to become better at it is by practicing it in a deliberate, disciplined fashion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:03:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780022</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;move our local communities off Facebook and onto our own platform. Is there a off-the-shelf solutionTo get better answers, you need to flesh out all the features of Facebook that your communities are using.  E.g. Shared event calendars?  Groups?  Private Messaging?  Video hosting for users to upload vids of community events? Live feeds?  Etc.Look at the left side of navigation topics to help you enumerate and think about it:
https://www.facebook.com/help/130979416980121/Do you expect those ~50k to create new logins for the new platform? Or do they sign in with their existing "Facebook ID" to avoid hassle of new account creation?  Do they need a phone app?  If it's website only from the smartphone web browser, do you need web push for notifications?  Facebook interaction with others has convenient lookup from the phones' contact listing.  Web-only site doesn't have straightforward access to smartphone's address book (without PhoneGap).  Etc.If your communities are using a lot of those social networking features, it means trying to use Mastodon as a substitute for Facebook is going to be a very incomplete solution.Of course, alternative solutions are not going to fully match Facebook but you still need to think of the threshold for a minimum viable feature set so your 50k users won't reject it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I live in a more rural community (moved from a big city). We have 5-6 small (~50k people) towns, all well connected. Everything happens on Facebook. I would like to move to a different platforms. Plus points for self-hosted, federated.Do YOU want to move off of Facebook for some reason, or do people want to move off of Facebook for some reason. MOST people in the US, especially in a rural are are not going to quit an app because say the CEO of a company is friendly to the President. You have an uphill battle, and at best you are going to shed a majority of users. Facebook is a popular platform, especially for those 30+ people in a small town that use local groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Disclaimer: I've never tried to move large numbers of people off of Facebook; I have organized community groups from scratch before, and I have led initiatives at work that consisted largely of convincing people to do a thing.  Much of this advice is from that perspective.  YMMV.)So: my advice is to not think of it as all-or-nothing.  You will not be able to move 300k people off of Facebook overnight.  This is somewhat akin to every IT migration project ever: it always takes longer than you think, and is not always a linear process from "fewer people migrated" to "more people migrated".It's also akin to community organizing: there is no substitute for actually talking to people about it, especially in the initial phases.  Or: high-touch sales, where you may initially need to spend a lot of energy and time per person successfully moved over.  The other common thing here is that you will hear "no" a lot, which is a valuable experience anyways (but will be frustrating).Also: unfortunately, no one will care if it's self-hosted or federated, outside of niche tech circles.  They will care about whether they can reach the people they want to reach, and whether the user experience is good or not.  This is reality: talking about these points will not help you.Some things you'll probably need to do:- Identify a single credible alternative platform. 
- Identify specific groups of people who are willing to be early "de-adopters".  For instance: a local youth group, a sports club, whatever.  Ideally you are a part of this group already; you then have a much better chance.  Businesses will likely say no, so you want community groups.
- Within those groups, identify champions: people who care about the same thing you care about, and are willing to commit time and effort to help.
- Together with your champions, build a toolkit that allows you to scale up your efforts.  This may be guides on how to talk to people about the change - what works, what doesn't.  This might be instructions for setting up a specific platform.  It might be communications channels, leaflets / flyers for putting up in public places, whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779776</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's journey to create "Guitaraoke," a project that allows musicians to easily play along with backing tracks by stripping vocals from songs. It begins with a focus on the technical aspects of using the Vamp plugin and ImageSharp to process audio and manipulate visuals. The author shares insights on handling audio chords and tracks, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying technologies like FFmpeg. The piece is the first part of a series, setting the stage for further exploration into music technology and its applications in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this is very nice, I hadn't seen it before. A few random thoughts:- The Vamp Plugin Pack for Mac finally got an ARM/Intel universal build in its 2.0 release last year, so hopefully the caveat mentioned about the M1 Mac should no longer apply- Most of the Vamp plugins in the Pack pre-date the pervasive use of deep learning in academia, and use classic AI or machine-learning methods with custom feature design and filtering/clustering/state models etc. (The associated papers can be an interesting read, because the methods are so explicitly tailored to the domain)- Audacity as host only supports plugins that emit time labels as output - this obviously includes beats and chords, but there are other forms of analysis plugins can do if the host (e.g. Sonic Visualiser) supports them- Besides the simple host in the Vamp SDK, there is another command-line Vamp host called Sonic Annotator (https://vamp-plugins.org/sonic-annotator/) which is  even harder to use, equally poorly documented, and even more poorly maintained, but capable of some quite powerful batch analysis and supporting a wider range of audio file formats. Worth checking out if you're curious(I'm the main author of the Vamp SDK and wrote bits of some of the plugins, so if you have other questions I may be able to help)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;any dylan beattie post must be accompanied with a recommendation for his hit single, You Give REST a Bad Namehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSKp2StlS6s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I’ve created 5-channel mixes of all the backing tracks so we can fade out specific instruments if somebody wants to play them liveHow was this done? This seems like an even more difficult task to do well than what’s described in the article&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738143</guid></item><item><title>15.

However, NFC recognition doesn’t always work as smoothly as one would hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious why the NFC tags are required at all?Can't you switch profiles on your phone without scanning an NFC tag already?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not the same idea, but the same category. You can Drag countries to different places on the Mercator projection to see how they warp and change size.Classic example is moving Greenland onto the US. Or Russia. Russia isn't talked about much in this case, but its dramatic how it changes.https://www.thetruesize.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this really a Mercator projection?  It doesn't appear to maintain the invariant that lines of constant bearing are straight lines.If I pick a point somewhere in the middle of Manhattan, the top point of Manhattan is somewhere near the top of the light colored area and the bottom point of Manhattan nearish the bottom of the light colored area.  This means that if I draw straight lines on the the map from San Francisco to these two points, the angle between them is something like 30 degrees.  They pass through very roughly the top and bottom of Nevada.  But there's no line of constant bearing that passes from SF through the top of Nevada to the top of Manhattan while at the same time one that passes through the bottom of Nevada to the bottom of Manhattan.This is all very wishy-washy, but it doesn't look right to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you search for "90,0" and then use the change orientation button to put the south pole on the bottom of the screen you can recover the more familiar distorted map.Other choices really do put into perspective how distorted this projection is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42783948</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've done research in this space for many years at Google AI and now at SnapCalorie. The thing I find interesting is how confident people are in their ability to estimate portion size visually, and in truth how wrong they all are.We published in CVPR (top peer reviewed academic conference for computer vision) and people are on average off by 53% and even trained professionals are still off by 40%. Basically if you want to have a higher level of accuracy you need to use a food scale or something that measure the volume of food, people just can't estimate portion sizes visually.Oils, cooking fats, hidden ingredients are what people are most concerned about but they actually add far less error to people's tracking than portion. Nutrition5k is the paper we published if you want to check out more details on the breakdown of error most people get when tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that "track and weight everything" (how ?) do you manage ?:- sauces you make yourself? I often mix some different oils, mustard, seeds, miso, bit of leamon juice and spices… but weighting and logging everything will take 3x the time to do the sauce itself- different cooking time in one receive : oignons going first, tomato sauce in the middle and parsley at the end (but still cook a bit with residual heat)- Leftovers nutrients decrease with time- counting how much you take of a meal shared with others, especially when you serves yourself multiple time- different species/cultivation methods like the rustic small and dense cucumber from your neighbor and the spongy one from the supermarket in JanuaryI have the feeling that might have been easy at some point in my life when I lived alone and mostly eat packaged food and raw vegetable that looked like clones but not when I share my meal, cook a lot more raw un-barcoded aliments and gained confidence to dose "by the eye" without recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people seem to have a purely emotional relationship with resources which logic doesn't seem to be able to penetrate. Food and finances seem similar here. For years I tried to get my wife to stick to a grocery budget. That is, we have $n per week for all groceries. She'd blow badly over the limit every time. "But we needed [food]" or "These were toiletries, so they don't _count_ as groceries." Ultimately we never had an real success sticking to a grocery budget, and ultimately the solution was me working towards better paying jobs.This feels a LOT like weight loss. Calories in --&gt; calories out is conceptually very simple, but in practice more people struggle with it than not. It certainly cannot be the case that they struggle with the concept; they struggle with actually putting it into action. Lying to themselves, twisting themselves into philosophical knots, and probably most often, conceding to their cravings. Food acquisition is one of out more basic drives, so it should probably be no surprise that people struggle to intellectualize it.(as and aside, there are also people who wrongly believe that calories in --&gt; calories out is a flawed concept because not all people have the same metabolism, or not all calories are equal. Both of these are true, but none of them actually negate the premise. For whatever your metabolism, and whatever your category of calories, fewer calories will still produce weight loss. It may feel unfair that someone doesn't have to work as hard as you to produce the same result, but this is actually true in all areas of life. Now that said, improving the quality of your calories is very important, and should not be ignored -- but it also does not negate the premise.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779147</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What fascinates me most is not the protocol itself, but the potential to add a thin scripting layer (similar to Redis' EVAL or the newer modules API) to enable complex logic with atomic transactions and high QPS.In the past, we relied heavily on using EVAL[SHA] with 200+ loc Lua scripts in order to implement high throughput, atomic transactions for realtime systems. We also used the JSON &amp; Redis Query Language (previous named "full-text search") to build a more maintainable &amp; strongly consistent system than using raw key-values and manually building secondary indexes.We’ve since migrated to a native FoundationDB and SQLite hybrid setup, but this approach would have been really helpful for early-stage prototyping with a higher performance ceiling (thanks to FDB sharding) than a single-node Redis with AOF.Related: Redis Cluster is a world of pain when handling clustering keys and cross-node queries and orchestration. DragonflyDB is chasing after the market of companies considering sharding Redis because of performance issues by providing better single-node performance. There's probably an alternative approach that could work by using an architecture like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The awesome thing about Redis is that it's less a "cache" and more a set of fast network-shared, generic data structures. To have that then also be transactional and durable would be really handy sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If only it wasn't Java.. but it looks very cool anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:04:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771403</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What's changed?Largely, the make up of the audience in HN. I sincerely doubt that the hard core of people doing startups, thinking of doing a startup, or just very interested in the topic has gone away or changed attitude very much.But the profile of HN has grown. It's a miracle that it's still an interesting and curious group, but from comments I'd be astounded if there were not a far greater proportion of people who are here because they are generically interested in tech topics and not specifically startups. That broader group was always there, of course, just its proportions relative to the hard core of entrepreneurs has changed.I'd love to see some objective analysis of how things changed after the twitter and reddit kerfuffles, but I don't believe the article's thesis that the zeitgeist is the cause.PS I could live without the stories that violate the precept of "If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic." ... but it's still pretty good here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd say starting a company to make something people want in order to sell it for money is still relevant. It's just that you're looking at working quietly, humbly, but perseverantly for the next 25 years, slowly growing the business and balancing the risks and opportunities along the way. You won't be looking for an "exit" because you want to take care of the company you built. That's a very different story from whatever vibe it is that startups acquired after the dotcom boom, i.e. find something that hasn't been done before, scales quickly, and sell the company after a few years for 1000x, and then something.That never was sustainable, I think, and effectively it became a glorified hiring process for big tech who bought the best toy companies to get to the people behind. And now even big tech figured it's cheaper to just hire the talent directly and not buy their token company for a few million first just to get the guys in.Not saying a good company with a good idea and execution at the right time couldn't still make it big quick: there always were some lucky ones and there will always be. But the process isn't repeatably stable enough that there's a lot of wasted effort to make a few shooting stars. And everybody seems to be slowly accepting that. Go for it if the opportunity arises but if you spend 10 years trying and trying without the fish biting you're likely better off saving off from a decent salary when those years have passed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO building startup became a status symbol which means that the payment in respect for making a courageous adventure is lost and commoditized. We are slowly seeing the same for academia.Point 2 resonates with me. Risk adjusted it is very unlikely that one will make a reasonable salary doing startups. So it is conviction and heart that needs to drive it.For me, the main issue is that every time I voice the idea about building something I get bombarded with premature growth and commercialization concerns instead of excitement about how to solve the problem. I think this is endemic - the entire sector is short sighted and profit obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42778266</guid></item><item><title>20.

Anyways, I stumbled on some of Rafael's drawings and found their inclusion of the guide lines / measuring lines invaluable, but for the hell of it, I emailed him some questions.
He promptly responded and then dumped images and reference material on dropbox for me - very nice guy.Personal fav is "Dürer" that demonstrates Albrecht Dürers method of projecting a spiral.https://www.rafael-araujo.com/product-page/d%C3%BCrer#&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first glance the "masterpieces" looked like a crap ton of lines and circles around a sketched shell or butterfly. You know, the kind you see when you tell Stable Diffusion to "sketch". Then I watched the video for a sec... WOAH!!! He is talking about a "formula" quite a bit... ctrl-f "formula" == 0 results.Google: Rafael Araujo artist formula. Ahhhh! https://www.rafael-araujo.com/calculationNow we are getting somewhere... and another that shows the process a bit better: https://hazelhomeartandantiques.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-cal...Now I am trawling github to see if I can find some processing or similar libraries that I can play around with.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A researcher gave a presentation on this topic a few years ago, "It's Sirius O'Clock: Astronomical Timekeeping in Ancient Egypt":&gt; Ever wondered how the Ancient Egyptians kept time? Well, Dr. Sarah Symons from McMaster University wondered about this, too.  With the help of some of her colleagues, she participated in a research project to find out how they managed time. On April 10, 2019, she presented some of her findings at the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada - Toronto Centre's Speaker's Night. The meeting was held at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto Canada.* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak07dI-TALU* https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/symonss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than a thousand years after these Middle Kingdom coffin lids, highly engineered mechanical star trackers (astrolabes) were used to calculate the time at night.Here’s a letter accompanying the gift of a gold and silver astrolabe from the Lybian philosopher Synesius to a Byzantine general. Interestingly, it shows that Hypatia of Alexandria contributed to the design of Synesius’ Astrolabe. It further indicates that Astrolabes could be used as “night clocks” and as instruments of philosophical investigation. https://www.livius.org/sources/content/synesius/synesius-on-...“I am therefore offering you a gift most befitting for me to give, and for you to receive. It is a work of my own devising, including all that she, my most reverend teacher [Hypatia], helped to contribute, and it was executed by the best hand to be found in our country in the art of the silversmiths”The letter also discusses how much geometry and astronomy had progressed since the time of Ptolemy. Hypatia’s father, Theon of Alexandria, had recently published “Euclid’s Elements of Geometry,” the most successful and influential geometry textbook of all time. I’ll note that this work was almost certainly produced with the help of his mathematical genius daughter, even if she wasn’t formally credited.But nice to see Synesius credit her so directly here, in the production of this mechanical star computer (as I believe an astrolabe has right to be called).And, while he did not credit the Egyptians, he credits the beginnings of the Greek philosophical knowledge of the stars to Pythagoras (who is claimed by Iamblichus to have become an Egyptian priest).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't mention north stars at all sadly.While we all (should) know that the Earth rotates on its axis, not as many people know that the axis is 'wobbly', kind of like a children's top as it slows down a bit. So a line that goes through the North and South Poles points differently over time: currently it points roughly to Polaris, but go back a while—e.g., Ancient Egypt—and it pointed to Thuban (and other starts between then and now):* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThubanSee also two related stars for the Egyptians:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IndestructiblesThe current idea is that they used those star(s) to align the pyramids:* https://www.astronomy.com/science/are-the-egyptian-pyramids-...* https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/thuban-past-north-star/* https://www.science.org/content/article/stars-date-egyptian-...If anyone is traveling/visiting the Western US, and can drop by the Hoover Dam, a similar astronomical design element is present:&gt; On the western flank of the Hoover Dam stands a little-understood monument, commissioned by the US Bureau of Reclamation when construction of the dam began in 01931. The most noticeable parts of this corner of the dam, now known as Monument Plaza, are the massive winged bronze sculptures and central flagpole which are often photographed by visitors. The most amazing feature of this plaza, however, is under their feet as they take those pictures.&gt; The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth.* https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/the-26-000-year-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42774228</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of "concept cells," specialized neurons in the brain that are thought to play a crucial role in abstracting information and forming memories. Researchers have discovered that these cells activate in response to specific ideas or concepts, allowing us to associate different experiences and knowledge into cohesive memories. The understanding of concept cells advances our knowledge of memory formation and retrieval processes, potentially leading to insights into memory-related disorders. The findings emphasize the brain's remarkable ability to generalize information from specific experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question related to 3D mesh models in general: has any significant work been done on models oriented towards photogrammetry?Case in point, I have a series of photos (48) that capture a small statue. The photos are high quality, the object was on a rotating platform. Lighting is consistent. The background is solid black.These normally are ideal variables for photogrammetry but none of the various common applications and websites do a very good job creating a mesh out of it that isn't super low poly and/or full of holes.I've been casually scanning huggingface for relevant models to try out but haven't really found anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative AI is going to drive the marginal cost of building 3D interactive content to zero. Unironically this will unlock the metaverse, cringe as that may sound. I'm more bullish than ever on AR/VR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the AI un-initiated; is this something you could feasibly run at home? eg on a 4090? (How can I tell how "big" the model is from the github or huggingface page?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:05:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42786040</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note about GitHub Windows Actions runners: I think I understand what is wrong with them, though it's somewhat conjecture since I don't actually know how it works internally.It looks like the free CI runners have C: drive pointing to a disk that is restored from a snapshot, but often times it hasn't finished restoring the entire snapshot by the time your workflow runs, so IO can be very slow, even if you don't need to read from the still-frozen parts of the disk. Some software ran inside workflows will do heavy R/W on C: drive, but it's better to move anything that will be written to disk, e.g. caches, to D: if possible. This often leads to much better performance with I/O and more predictable runtimes, particularly when there isn't a lot of actual compute to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tale as old as time;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see the value in this, but I don't get why it needs to be a SaaS. Don't get me wrong; a revenue stream for something this obviously useful is great! But why not just make it dual licensing; non-commercial projects get it under AGPL or some custom license that prevents them from using it commercially. Everyone else gets a bog-standard yearly license or such... Why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great idea, and it looks like you've done a great job!  I share your enthusiasm for these printers.  I have a Rongta receipt printer sitting on my desk that I like to play with :-)I have a business usecase for something like this (now that Chrome doesn't allow printing to ESC/POS), and exposing the printer interface as an HTTP API is a clever and great solution!  But, sending the data through a third party is a complete no-go for us for reasons of compliance.  For this architecture to work for us we would have to host it on our VPN and serve it from our own domain as our customers have a strict whitelist.As cool an idea as this is, honestly though I don't think this should be a SaaS.  Certainly it doesn't fit the typical mold of SaaS where there's nothing to install because it's all delivered through the web.  Given you have to install a local Pi or other, you lose all the benefits of SaaS and also incur all the downsides of SaaS.  It feels like it was shoehorned into a SaaS because otherwise it would be very hard to monetize.  I don't blame you for that because it is indeed a hard problem to figure out how to get paid (in fact I've abandoned good ideas prevously because it was either SaaSify something that shouldn't be a SaaS or else face huge obstacles getting paid), but I wanted to share my thoughts honestly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, the question is: Can it print with a Cat Printer?You know, the cheap toy-like printers? Like this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Portable-Instant-Bluetooth-Wireless...I was trying to hack mine to use it with an app I want to create for personal use. Currently only prints using the official Fun Print app over a bluetooth connection.There are projects[0]that are supposed to work with a cat printer but mine specifically isn’t. It identifies itself as “MXW01” , which is different that the printers tested.[0]

Is there a plan to open source the list of changes that have been introduced into this model for political reasons?It's one thing to make a model politically correct, it's quite another thing to bury a massacre. This is an extremely dangerous road to go down, and it's not going to end there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the R1 paper, if the benchmark are correct, even the 1.5b and 7b models are outperforming Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and you can run these models on a 8-16GB macbook, that's insane...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is wrong, only the distilled models from llama, qwen are on ollama, not the actual official MoE r1 model from deepseekv3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772983</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, these are beautiful. My dad used to make these as a sort of hobby (he liked any excuse to hop on the lathe, and they made great gifts; you don't realize how awful the ones in big box stores are until someone makes you a proper one). He'll love to see this.It didn't occur to me that there'd be such an extensive collection of something seemingly so obscure, yet here we are. It seems like this exists for everything out there.It's very nostalgic in a way. Though my dad's were different, the dark, solid wood and geometric shapes bring me back to my childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These are handsome, but my real question is: how's the mechanism? Of the half dozen or so pepper mills I've owned, half of them kind of sucked from the get-go (the current one grinds ok, but doesn't feed fresh peppercorns without a regular shake), and the other half broke in a couple years (the last one the adjustment mechanism jammed up). I don't feel like I'm an unreasonably aggressive pepper grinder, nor do I think I use an abnormally large amount of pepper.

&lt;p&gt;JReleaser is a tool designed to simplify the process of releasing Java applications by automating the creation of packages for different platforms and managing artifacts. It supports various formats, including standalone applications and installers, and integrates seamlessly with build tools like Maven and Gradle. The tool allows developers to configure release settings, manage versioning, and ensure the application is properly documented and packaged for distribution. JReleaser aims to streamline the release process, saving time and reducing manual effort for Java developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just built a library on jReleaser!https://github.com/NJAldwin/maven-central-testI wanted to release a jvm lib on Maven Central -- which no longer requires opening a jira ticket for a new package!  Instead, simple DNS TXT verification is all that's needed.  However, the caveat is that it's the new Maven Central service, which doesn't have as much support in build tools as the older sonatype one.  jReleaser is one of the few tools which supports it.So I hacked together a fully self-contained minimally reproducible example of a Gradle library, built and published in GitHub using jReleaser.There were several things that had me scratching my head with jReleaser, and the docs are strangely organized IMO (it comes from supporting so many facets, I believe), but it ended up working well enough!I ended up adding a doc build and some other stuff to the repo too.  Now I have a full example that I can use to trivially publish new libraries (such as in-progress https://github.com/NJAldwin/ambient-consumer ).(Why Maven Central?  Since the demise of jFrog/jCenter/BinTray, there's not been an easy way to widely publish jvm libraries.  At work I've used GH packages, but that requires a GitHub login even for public packages, which is a significant barrier IME.  JitPack is one option, but it does on-demand builds linked closely to the origin repo, whereas I wanted the classic immutable build published on release.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice to see JReleaser here on HN! I'm very happy with it, using it for publishing releases of kcctl (a command line client for Kafka Connect written in Java, compiled and published as native binaries for Linux/MacOS/Win via GraalVM). Here's the config, in case folks are looking for an example: https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl/blob/main/pom.xml#L430-L530. Releases are triggered by running a parameterized workflow (taking the version to be released) on GitHub Actions.A big shout-out to Andres Almiray, the maintainer of JReleaser, who has always been super-fast to answer any questions and help to sort out issues when I ran into them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it somehow related to GoReleaser? I saw GoReleaser supports multiple languages now as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784880</guid></item><item><title>29.

This seems production ready for smaller shops where it's feasible for developers to sign artifacts individually. For a system where you'd want CI to publish artifacts, and then use the k8s policy controller to only run verified artifacts, it seems incomplete.It appears the reason to include this system in a toolchain would be to meet compliance requirements, but even the GCP, AWS, and Azure implementations of artifact signing &amp; verification are in beta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat adjacent question: are there people working on ways to verify that a particular server or API backend are running the specific signed release that is open sourced? Can a company somehow cryptographically prove to its users that the running build is derived from the source unmodified?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSR supports sigstore https://jsr.io/docs/trust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784892</guid></item><item><title>30.

The black circle is the ball; you roll the dice to determine the amount of moves2. after the dice roll, the allowed moves will be shown - as yellow squares near the ball; this is a very faint yellow and easy to miss3. to move the ball, roll the dice then click on the faint yellow squares near the ball (or further away if you rolled a 6).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:06:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42746752</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical context and evolution of sex education, particularly focusing on the Regency era in Britain. It highlights how attitudes toward sexuality were shaped by various cultural, medical, and social factors, and examines the implications of these views on contemporary sex education. The piece argues that understanding past perspectives on sexuality can inform current discussions and approaches to educating young people about sexual health and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

The author talk a lot about "sexual books" of the times, but you will certainly not find the "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" (Fanny Hill) in the hand of a proper young woman.
(this stuff where costly rarities for men too).It was far more simpler than this, no need for books.Every rural girls and boys, and women and men living in a city did know, without any books,
what there is to know simply by looking at the animals in the farms
or the horses and dogs in the streets.There was also the "education" at the wash-houses... The hubs to know everything there is to now at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is --per usual-- not warranting the scope of the title. A more accurate title would be: Some literature possibly used in educating aristocratic English women about sex. The subtitle then would be: while simultaneously plugging my own book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely fascinating. The deep history of obvious knowledge of reproduction side by side with astounding ignorance is palpable. Joseph Heller wrote about it in catch-22 and a parade of modern day unexpected pregnancy stories are testament to it's continuance.What's equally fascinating is the equally dichotomous side by side knowledge of STDs and their effect on pregnancy. You get a lot of it in "who do you think you are" ancestry type shows, when there is the massive family lots of children dead quickly story.I do love a good bodice ripper. Dorothy Dunnett was my stand out historian author, maybe I have a (-substantially more fruity) alternative to explore.(Bridgerton was fun but I find Georgette Heyer just as fun, and you can't beat her on the peninsular wars or Waterloo alongside the heaving bosoms)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42739597</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being new to python, the astral stuff is such a relief.I don’t think experienced python folks realize how much the flexible tooling slows people down, and creates friction for adopters. Setting up my project I tried 3 environment managers, 2 type checkers, 3 formatters/linters, 3 packagers/dependancy/project managers.I know this is kinda the n+1 issue where astral is just adding another. But it feels like a complete and well designed stack, not a box of parts encouraging me to build my own. Reminds me a bit of go tooling.I am a convert. I’ll happily jump on their type checker and packager when ready.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a little sad that Ruff took off as a re-implementation of a whole bunch of work that was already done, rather than as a project to improve the work that was already done.It was nice to be able to write little extra linters or flake8 plugins in the language I was linting. Plus decades of effort had gone into making those plugins pretty great, finding the right separation of linting codes so that the right things could be linted/ignored per codebase.I understand why they did it, and they have done it remarkably well, but "rewrite it from scratch" is almost never the best answer and part of me wonders if this result could have been even better achieved another way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very impressed by the recent developer experience improvements in the python ecosystem. Between ruff, uv, and https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach we'll be able to keep our django monolith going for a long time.Any opinions about the current state of the art type checker?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42775029</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the frustrations of couriers who are increasingly reliant on algorithms to manage their deliveries, which they find perplexing and often unfair. Couriers express concerns about the lack of transparency in how these algorithms operate, leading to unpredictable work conditions, income instability, and feelings of being dehumanized. Despite the technological advancements intended to optimize logistics, many couriers feel that the algorithms prioritize efficiency over their wellbeing, creating a challenging work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

People are accused of fraud, and have their access withdrawn - but nobody will explain what they allegedly did, because that would leak information about the fraud detection.It's a kind of automated low trust economy. The drivers don't trust the apps, and the app doesn't trust the drivers, so the thing has to be held together by surveillance and micromanagement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is room for a food delivery horror game.

The red dot on the flag of Japan was off center by 1/100 towards the pole before 1999.
The naval flag of France is not of equal proportions. the proportion are; blue 30, white 33, and red 37&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes turtle graphics are very educational, I taught it (via PyTurtle) to 11-year-olds, who picked it up easily ("draw a house, then translate into instructions for the little turtle").BTW, there is no "Western European Union" any more, just one European Union, so the now simplified flag can leave out the white ugly letters in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm in awe that in 2024 the first introduction to programming can be a turtle in Python, just like it was in 1982 when someone came to my primary school to show everyone a turtle in Logo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:07:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772911</guid></item><item><title>36.

The article doesn’t explain how that makes it respond to sunlight, which is what their demonstration system does. I didn’t think sunlight and humidity were always correlated. Am I missing something obvious?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why they went with that shape, surely it's possible to design anything if you start from the principle that some materials expand when moist and contract when dry.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of the `context` package in Go programming, arguing that it can lead to complications in code readability and maintainability. The author advocates for a simplified approach, suggesting that the use of `context` should be minimized or eliminated in favor of more explicit handling of dependencies and parameters.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is about an explicit argument of type "Context". I'm not a Go user, and at first I thought it was about something else: an implicit context variable that allows you to pass stuff deep down the call stack, without intermediate functions knowing about it.React has "Context", SwiftUI has "@Environment", Emacs LISP has dynamic scope (so I heard). C# has AsyncLocal, Node.JS AsyncLocalStorage.This is one of those ideas that at first seem really wrong (isn't it just a global variable in disguise?) but is actually very useful and can result in cleaner code with less globals or less superfluous function arguments. Imagine passing a logger like this, or feature flags. Or imagine setting "debug = True" before a function, and it applies to everything down the call stack (but not in other threads/async contexts).Implicit context (properly integrated into the type system) is something I would consider in any new language. And it might also be a solution here (altough I would say such a "clever" and unusual feature would be against the goals of Go).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you use ctx.Value in my (non-existent) company, you’re firedThis is such a bad take.ctx.Value is incredibly useful for passing around context of api calls. We use it a lot, especially for logging such context values as locales, ids, client info, etc. We then use these context values when calling other services as headers so they gain the context around the original call too. Loggers in all services pluck out values from the context automatically when a log entry is created. It's a fantastic system and serves us well. e.g.    log.WithContext(ctx).Errorf("....", err)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is from 2017!As others have already mentioned, there won't be a Go 2. Besides, I really don't want another verbose method for cancellation; error handling is already bad enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777625</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article. My partner bought an Apple watch a couple of years ago and I was shocked at what a poor value proposition it was. Very expensive and wouldn't even hold a charge for a day. I guess you get used to it but having to charge my watch every day would drive me mad. Obviously there are things it will do better than a Garmin (and things it can do that a Garmin simply can't) but overall it didn't make sense to me as a product (or, evidently, to my partner, who now leaves it gathering dust).I do think Garmin have found a really good balance for their devices in being smart but not "too smart". I have had a Vívoactive 3 for years that I am pretty happy with. Good battery life and does all the basic fitness stuff plus some actually useful extras like alerting me to phone notifications, etc.Also interesting is that the phone never just replaced standalone GPS fitness trackers. It's entirely possible to just use your phone to track your run, though obviously there are downsides, like you don't get heart rate tracking and it's a lot bulkier (though I think most people probably run with their phone anyway).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a Garmin Descent Mk2i which I use for scuba diving, and it's a fabulous all-purpose fitness and adventure watch. I've used to for hundreds of dives, navigation on  multiple backpacking trips, cycling, and tons of other stuff. I even wear it daily, and it nicely supports notifications from my phone.When Garmin originally launched a scuba watch, I was kind of surprised. It's a small market, and there were a lot of established "good enough" players in the space. Everyone already had a dive computer. Who would want an expensive one from Garmin when they could buy an expensive one from Shearwater? But Garmin showed up with a good product, iterated by adding their sonar based SubWave for air integration, and eventually took a lot of marketshare by including fitness and smartwatch features the competitors lacked. Now I see tons of Garmins on dive boats. People love them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, let's review:1) build headquarters in (relatively) low COL city - in this case, Olathe KS, which is a suburb of Kansas City MO.2) Have people who actually want to make a product instead of making analysts happy3) Invest in R&amp;D4) Bring manufacturing in-house and tightly control processesIt's like everything the people actually doing the work at tech companies have been saying for years.Can I have my $10mil/year pay package now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:27 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752299</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the reverse engineering of the Pentium microprocessor, particularly focusing on its BiCMOS (Bipolar-CMOS) technology, which combines both bipolar and CMOS transistors. It outlines the process of analyzing the chip's architecture, including the layout and functionality of various components like its ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) and caches. The author discusses the significance of this reverse engineering effort in understanding historical computing technology and emphasizes the challenges encountered during the process. The piece also reflects on the implications of such work for future innovations in the field of microprocessor design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, memories.  I was a manufacturing engineer in a bipolar factory from 1989 to 1992, and BiCMOS was the perennial hope for a future for our acquired skills.  When word broke that the Pentium would have one, it seemed significant.  On the whole, though, it didn't have the impact that was hoped for; bipolar hangs on (like COBOL) in certain niches, but I think despite the theoretical advantages, the disadvantages of having to think about both bipolar and CMOS transistors in the engineering, was too much of a price to pay.Lesser known reasons: as bipolar transistors went to polysilicon gates (which have a tiny, ~1-2 Angstrom thick layer of oxide in them) and MOS transistors started to become leakier through their ever-shrinking gate oxides, the distinction between MOS and bipolar transistors became fuzzier.  Modern MOS transistors leak less current through their gate oxides than the bipolar transistors did through the polysilicon emitter, but the physics of the two is not as different as it was twenty years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is BiCMOS radical woke? :-)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and implications of the "uname" command in Unix-like operating systems, which provides essential information about the system's architecture, hostname, and operating system. It explains the different options available with the command and how it can be used for system identification and monitoring. The author emphasizes its utility for both system administrators and users, highlighting practical examples and potential applications in various scenarios. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to understanding and effectively utilizing the "uname" command in a Unix environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had recently run into an embedded problem where when switching the order of two functions in the source code, one of them would refuse to work. I tried a number of things without identifying the real error, and finally had to add a comment warning any later parties not to do this.
I even checked the assembly and they seem to be consistent. But when I upload to firmware, the error keeps coming back over and over again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a number of edge cases in embedded where static variables can become unreliable. I am not saying it is common exactly but it is certainly not unheard of. I usually keep it in my list of things to check when stuff is mysteriously going wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bugs like these are fun to read about, but never fun to debug if you need to get something else done. Nice writeup by Lup Yuen Lee once again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42751785</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The "Unconventional Adventures" page highlights unique travel experiences that break away from traditional tourism. It emphasizes the thrill of exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations, engaging in unusual activities, and embracing local cultures. The content encourages readers to seek out extraordinary adventures that offer a deeper connection to the places and people they encounter, ultimately promoting a sense of exploration and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look up Beau Miles on YouTube for more in this vein of unconventional adventures.Personally, I am a fan of exploring local waterways in the smallest, simplest boat you can find. The smaller the boat, the bigger the adventure. I recently built a folding 6 foot sailboat that I can sail with my young kid to a “distant shore” and pack up and carry home via public transport or Uber when we get there. Learning to build a boat- and traveling all around to find the right wood and materials was itself a great adventure.Ultimately, being the first to do something only matters for recognition, something people are too obsessed with nowadays. It is just as fun to do something you’ve never done before as something never at all done before- either way it’s new to you! Don’t tell anyone about it, don’t make it a social media spectacle, just do it for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do a small version of this in my own town. We're surrounded by public land, and I find stuff in the lidar data that looks interesting. And then I head out cross country through the forest to try to figure out what it is. Stumble across all kinds of weird stuff along the way. I love it even though I think most people would find it boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This speaks to me!In 2015, a friend and I resolved to ride our bicycles across Japan. I had felt the yearn to go on an adventure that engaged my whole body and encouraged exploration in an environment completely new to me. I deeply desired some version of crossing Middle Earth, and a bike ride with a start and end point but no plan in between felt like just the thing.In April of 2016 we set off from Kagoshima, and a few weeks later we ended our trip in Osaka. We made it roughly a third as far as we had wanted, but it’s a trip we’ll never forget, and one that we desperately want to continue someday. It scratched an itch I didn’t know how else I could scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:08:57 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767908</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu Theorem states that the excess demand curve for a market economy of rational agents can take the shape of any function, subject only to three fairly general conditions: the function must be continuous, must be homogeneous of degree zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function), and must satisfy Walras's law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walras%27s_law).Inconveniently for all economic theories, the implication of this mathematical proof is that excess demand and supply curves can take any shape that meets those three  conditions. The nicely sloped supply and demand curves we've all been shown in Economics textbooks are basically figments of economists' imaginations.Moreover, the textbook supply-demand curves we've always been shown are for only one good. The curves for all goods in a market economy are high-dimensional.High-dimensional supply and demand curves can have multiple equilibrium points, and there is no guarantee that those points will be optimal or even good.In other words, for a long time we've had proof -- proof! -- that "free markets" are not guaranteed to converge toward good outcomes.Markets can get stuck in crappy equilibria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't know anything about this and found the article hard to understand at first, but thankfully the Wikipedia articles on the subject are pretty okay: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenschein%E2%80%93Mantel%E2...The very abbreviated TL;DR of this post is:1. We are taught that markets look like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Supply-d...2. By applying rigorous math ("general equilibrium theory"), it turns out that there is no reason that markets can't look like this instead: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/SMD_Dema...3. OP's article summarizes how economists have reacted to this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the nicely sloped supply and demand curves are economic equivalent of spherical cows and as much as we shouldn't design a milk industry around spherical cows, we shouldn't design an economy around a nicely sloped supply and demand curves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752637</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth analysis of the differences between the "unlink" and "del" commands in Redis, highlighting their internal mechanisms and performance implications. It explains that while both commands are used to remove keys from the database, "del" immediately deletes the key and blocks other operations during the process, potentially leading to performance issues in high-load scenarios. In contrast, "unlink" performs the deletion asynchronously, allowing the system to handle other operations concurrently, which can enhance performance. The article includes examples and scenarios to illustrate the practical applications and benefits of using each command effectively within Redis environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in the context of Christian apologetics, weighing their potential benefits and drawbacks. It explores how LLMs can aid in generating responses to theological questions and engaging with different perspectives, but raises concerns about the accuracy of information, the loss of human nuance, and the risk of relying too heavily on technology in spiritual discussions. Ultimately, the author emphasizes a balanced approach that incorporates LLMs as tools while maintaining the importance of human discernment and theological rigor in apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I've seen all the points made in the article (besides some that wouldn't work outside of this particular religious context), they are well laid out and highlight not only the technological limitations, but also the moral implications of building a llm product.Moral issues that are not limited to religion, I've had conversations with a friend where I was trying to explain to them that their llm website idea will, with certainty, mislead people at some point. I think the exact idea was to build a gpt-based trip planner. I'd hate to have someone spend time and money on hotel, transportations, etc... To end up stranded in the middle of nowhere.Anyway, the article came out 4 months ago and the chatbox is still there.&gt; Which programming language would allow me to get closer to God?&gt; If I had to choose a programming language that reflects some aspect of God's nature, I would say that a language with a strong emphasis on order, logic, and beauty, such as Python, could be seen as a reflection of God's character. The Bible says, "God is not a God of disorder but of peace" (1 Corinthians 14:33, ESV), and Python's simplicity and readability can be seen as a reflection of this aspect of God's nature.At least we got that one out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was an interesting meditation on the limits of AI and how ordinary people don't see those limits, wrapped up in a context I normally wouldn't expect to see AI at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a Christian the only way I use LLMs is to ask for specific verses, which I then pull up on my Bibles to confirm. I don't expect an LLM to ever understand my theological views (Christian theology is like... programming languages, nobody likes anyone else's...), but if I ask it questions like "how many verses have x phrase" I have some semblance of trust that it might figure out enough to feed me such verses.I prefer to ask LLMs for starting points in research goals essentially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:37 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42781293</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision of the OpenSSL project to not provide a QUIC API, stating that QUIC, a transport layer network protocol, is primarily managed in userspace rather than in system libraries. The author explains the implications of this decision for developers and the broader community, arguing that relying on a built-in API would not be beneficial as QUIC evolves and matures. Additionally, the post delves into the technical complexities of implementing QUIC and emphasizes the importance of keeping the OpenSSL library focused on its core objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note this is a blog post from 2021, which should be added to the title. The information included is out of date by several years now.OpenSSL has done stuff with QUIC since then, a cursory search turned up this README in their main repo on using QUIC and OpenSSL: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/README-QUIC.m...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an HTTP server author, this doesn't surprise me.We've ceded HTTP specification development to the big guys, and in so doing have made it more or less impossible to implement without resources on their scale. Have you looked at RFC 9000 et al? They're monstrously big, far larger than most independent shops could ever hope to economically pull off. The only way to comprehensively implement something of that scale is to have Google level resources to throw entire teams of engineers and years of focus at it.I've long said that any protocol worthy of being foundational should be reasonably implementable as a fourth-year term project. It doesn't have to be production ready or ergonomic or even generally useful, but if a group of fourth year CS students can't pull an end-to-end implementation together in a semester, the protocol is just too complex. It's not perfect, but it's as good of a yardstick as I've found.HTTP/1 passes this test easily; you can make a working version of it in about ninety seconds right in your terminal. HTTP/2 looks intimidating at first glance, but it's so much better specified than HTTP/1 that it's almost easier to get to a reasonable implementation. HTTP/3 on the other hand is...... well, weeks (if not months) of work  just to get a QUIC foundation working reasonably well enough that you could hope to start iterating on connections from a 'real' peer, and THEN you have to start on RFC 9114. Not to mention that the way it's structured you end up doing most of that work in the dark, hoping that you line everything up just so so that your first Hello World actually works. It's a way of working that is completely at odds with the hacker ethos that the best foundational protocols have in spades, and ends up looking and acting like what it is: a tool by the big guys, for the big guys. The rest of the internet need not apply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just recently apt listchanges informed me that "curl" (the binary) switched to gnuTLS to support HTTP3 (libcurl remained on openSSL for compatibility). So I assume this is still not fully resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:09:47 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777874</guid></item><item><title>48.

It looks like Dudeney (1917) predates these - the original source is his "Amusements in Mathematics" (https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16713/pg16713-images.ht...) and he poses there a different puzzle involving numbers on taxis.   I guess this is just a common source of integers appearing in one's environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because life is a cab array.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beside the problem.

I’ve got at least two family members that could probably be classified as hoarders.  They keep a bunch of stuff that they really should get rid of. But at least part of this is, I believe, ingrained upon them by their relatively impoverished upbringing. They would hang onto items of marginal value because that marginal value means more when you have to scrape by.Decluttering is a luxury. Rich people can throw out their rarely-used junk because it’s trivial for them to buy new stuff should the need arise. Poor people keep the “junk” because that little bit of potential residual value is a part of their livelihood.Most people should put their stack of National Geographics in the recycling bin, because it isn’t worth their time to find the person who’ll give them five bucks for it. For some people, that five bucks matters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:07 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742396</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article "We've Lost Our Respect for Complexity" explores the tendency in modern society to oversimplify complex issues and phenomena. It argues that this reductionist approach diminishes our understanding and appreciation of intricacies in various fields, such as science, culture, and technology. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing and engaging with complexity to foster deeper insights and more nuanced discussions, advocating for a shift back toward valuing thorough analysis over superficial conclusions. Additionally, the piece reflects on the societal implications of this trend, suggesting that embracing complexity can enhance critical thinking and informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing is, historically we never really had much respect for complexity.&gt; We talk about complex subjects all the time. Medicine, politics, economics, sociology, morality and moreFor our entire history we have being talking about complex subjects we barely understood and, like proud primates, we were always very vocal and cocksure about our view points.We experienced two cultural revolutions, first in the world of ancient Greece, subsequently in the modern era of scientific enlightenment. One can think of the emergent scientific method as effectively learning to respect complexity. Being humble about assertions that cannot be validated again and again, in different conditions, by different parties etc.The tangible result of this new trait (respecting complexity) was pretty amazing. But only for a precious few domains. Our default mode, being 100% sure about things we have little clue about (who needs hallucinating AI when you've got humans), continues to be the prevalent one.Whats worse, we now have what has been called "the pretence of knowledge" [1]. We know that real knowledge is powerful, so why not pretend we have it when we actually don't? This leads to a random mix of (typically self-serving) opinions coupled to the superficial use of scientific tools. A pathology most visible precisely in the above list of really complex topics.The risk is that as the challenges of our own complex societies mount, we will undo also what we have achieved, and effectively go back to become stochastic parrots, unhinged from complex reality.[1] https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/hay...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rise of complexity, and its collapse, defines every civilization for which we have historical records. Given that our society seem hell-bent on repeating the pattern, I question whether we ever had respect for it. It seems that we have nothing but arrogance to proclaim "this time we'll get it right" as we layer on the next layer of complexity.[1] Joseph Tainter "The Collapse of Complex Societies"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complexity has always been less respected the more it is separated from the experiences of the average person; or more personally, your own experiences. Unfortunately, that's the very nature of complexity itself. Dependencies increase instead of decrease in the hopes of scaling, saving time and money, or even providing a slightly better product. As positive as those efforts sound, they also make the failure cases worse.The only people to respect with regards to complexity are those dealing with inherent complexity -- especially when they're building more digestible abstractions, and those working to reduce complexity due to having a substantial understand of it. It can be rather difficult to distinguish between inherent complexity and incidental complexity though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 04:10:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777715</guid></item></channel></rss>
