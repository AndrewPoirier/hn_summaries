&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on providing insights and resources related to the concept of "reflective practice" in various contexts, emphasizing its importance for personal and professional development. It likely offers tools, examples, and methodologies to help individuals effectively engage in reflective practices to enhance their learning and growth. The goal is to promote self-awareness and continuous improvement through reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to try this, work through the artithmetic, it’s incredibly easy (and a fun Saturday morning exercise if you’re into this kind of thing) to code up on ShaderToy. From scratch is fun, but if you need a hint to get started I just made one https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mc3cW2 and there are a bunch of super clever text hacks other people have done like this Matrix in less than 300 characters https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llXSzj or green CRT display effect https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtfSD8. Loads of other examples abound if you look around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is delightfully clever and hacky (so basically like every 3d rendering technique ever) but the end result isn't exactly beautiful unless you're trying to recreate an old school electronic billboard. You could improve it by adding more bits, but long before it starts to look good you'd be searching for an easier way to handle setting all the bits... And there's almost certainly no more efficient solution than using black and white pixels in a drawing program then saving the results in a texture. So, full circle.If anyone is interested in the a more common way that modern 3d rendering engines draw text, look up SDF text (and related techniques like MSDF etc.). This uses a traditional texture atlas in a preprossing step to create an atlas of signed distance fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also the option of rendering text as meshes.TextMeshPro goes one step further and uses signed distance fields to handle arbitrary scale.https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093037</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Delta is a syntax-highlighting pager for git and diff output that enhances the readability of diffs in the terminal. It formats git diff output with color-coded differences, making it easier for users to review changes in code visually. Delta is designed to be customizable, allowing users to adjust colors, styles, and behavior to suit their needs. It also supports various features, such as paging, the ability to show word differences, and integration with tools like GitHub and GitLab. The project is open-source and actively maintained on GitHub, where users can find installation instructions and contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delta has been one of those set and forget things, it's been a while since I've seen 'bare' git grep/diff/blame output, I also use it all the time for normal diffs (outside of git repos), but TIL that it also works with ripgrep [0]As someone else already mentioned there is also bat[1], which was also set and forget, I aliased cat to bat and have a seperate alias vcat for 'vanilla cat' /usr/bin/cat[0] https://dandavison.github.io/delta/grep.html[1] https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a good point made, that has stuck with me over the years. that our syntax highlighters are highlighting the wrong thing.They should not be coloring the grammar, we are good at picking out grammar, they should be highlighting the symbols. each different variable and function name should be getting it's own color. that is, the goal is to make it quicker to distinguish different symbols, not that they are a symbol.But this is much harder than stylizing the grammar so all our tooling sticks with the easy thing rather that the useful thing. Now, I am being a bit mean on grammar styling. It does help quite a bit but I would like to see a symbol matching engine in action to see if that really works.Unfortunately I don't remember where I read the original post and am unable to attribute it correctly.update: while trying to look it up I found this https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2014/09/27/the-definitive-gui...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of diffs, one thing that annoys me about Git's diff output is that is prints file paths like Unix diff traditionally does, starting with the two file names:    --- a/some/path/to/file.c
    +++ b/some/path/to/file.c

I often cmd-click in iTerm to open a file in an editor, but this doesn't work here because of the a/ and b/ prefixes. Any way to make Git format the file name better? I don't even need two lines here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091365</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent developments in research related to gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR, and their potential applications in treating genetic disorders. It highlights breakthroughs made by scientists in refining these tools to enhance precision and reduce off-target effects in gene modification. The piece also examines ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with the use of CRISPR in humans, stressing the need for responsible advancements in the field amidst growing interest from both the scientific community and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely metal and the person I would aspire to be.I can't imagine a higher motivation to study and find a cure than to save yourself, with the possible exception of saving a loved one.As other have mentioned, finding a cure for a specific case is easier and has less regulations than finding a general cure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one silver lining of having such a terrible diagnosis should be that you are immediately unbound from normal FDA requirements and are able and try anything in the pipeline that might work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see possible ethical objections, for example if there was a risk that one of these self-ministered viruses was contagious (no idea) that would create scope for harming people.Of if it was a form of embezzlement or something, like there was funding for X and it got used for “treat my own cancer” that would be bad.But TFA seems to say that the ethical problem is “did experiment risky to the patient on myself”, which just seems strictly more ethically clear than “do experiment risky to the patient on other people”, which is a norm, but a regrettable necessity.Did I misread it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094573</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the architecture, they will probably run into some issues. We are doing something similar with SemanticDiff [1] and also started out using tree-sitter grammars for parsing and GumTree for matching. Both choices turned out to be problematic.Tree sitter grammars are primarily written to support syntax highlighting and often use a best effort approach to parsing. This is perfectly fine for syntax highlighting, since the worst that can happen is that a few characters are highlighted incorrectly. However, when diffing or modifying code you really want the code to be parsed according to the upstream grammar, not something that mostly resembles it. We are currently in the process of moving away from tree-sitter and instead using the parsers provided by the languages themselves where possible.GumTree is good at returning a result quickly, but there are quite a few cases where it always returned bad matches for us, no matter how many follow-up papers with improvements we tried to implement. In the end we switched over to a dijkstra based approach that tries to minimize the cost of the mapping, which is more computationally expensive but gives much better results. Difftastic uses a similar approach as well.[1]: https://semanticdiff.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tool has an excellent architecture section [0] that goes into how it works under the hood.  It stands out to me that a complex tool has an overview to this depth that allows you to grasp conceptually how it works.0 - https://mergiraf.org/architecture.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going through the sorts of conflicts it solves, and limitations in that, I find it claiming that in some insertions, order doesn’t matter &lt;https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html#neighbouring-insertions-...&gt;.I really don’t like that. At the language level, order may not matter, but quite frequently in such cases the order does matter, insofar as almost every human would put the two things in a particular order; or where there is a particular convention active. If you automatically merge the two sides in a different order from that, doing it automatically has become harmful.My clearest example: take Base `struct Foo; struct Bar;`, then between these two items, Left inserts `impl Foo { }`, Right inserts `struct Baz;`. To the computer, the difference doesn’t matter, but merging it as `struct Foo; struct Baz; impl Foo { } struct Bar;` is obviously bad to a human. This is the problem: it’s handling language syntax semantics, but can’t be aware of logical semantics. (Hope you can grasp what I’m trying to convey, not sure of the best words.) Left was not inserting something between Foo and Bar, it was attaching something to the end of Foo. Whereas Right was probably inserting something between Foo and Bar—but maybe even it was inserting something before Bar. You perceive that these are all different things, logically.Another example where this will quickly go wrong: in CSS rulesets, some will sort the declarations by property name lexicographically, some by property name length (seriously, it’s frequently so pretty), some will group by different types of property… you can’t know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093756</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "html-to-markdown" provides a tool for converting HTML documents into Markdown format. It is designed to simplify the process of extracting content from HTML while preserving the structure and readability. The project includes detailed documentation, installation instructions, and examples demonstrating its usage. It employs a customizable approach, allowing users to tailor the conversion process to meet their specific needs. The repository also encourages contributions from the community to improve functionality and support additional use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need this sort of thing in any other language, there's a free, no-auth, no-api-key-required, no-strings-attached API that can do this at https://jina.ai/reader/You just fetch a URL like `https://r.jina.ai/https://www.asimov.press/p/mitochondria`, and get a markdown document for the "inner" URL.I've actually used this and it's not perfect, there are websites (mostly those behind Cloudflare and other such proxies) that it can't handle, but it does 90% of the job, and is an one-liner in most languages with a decent HTTP requests library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pandochttp://www.cantoni.org/2019/01/27/converting-html-markdown-u...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! And glad to see it's MIT licensed.I wonder if it is feasible to use this as a replacement for p2k, instapaper etc for the purpose of reading on Kindle. One annoyance with these services is that the rendering is way off -- h elements not showing up as headers, elements missing randomly, source code incorrectly rendered in 10 different ways. Some are better than others, but generally they are disappointing. (Yet they expect you to pay a subscription fee.) If this is an actively maintained project that welcomes contribution, I could test it out with various articles and report/fix issues. Although I wonder how much work there will be for handling edge cases of all the websites out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093511</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Obtainium is a platform designed to help users easily acquire and manage NFTs and cryptocurrencies. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of minting, buying, and trading digital assets while providing tools for tracking and managing portfolios. The site emphasizes security and provides resources for both beginners and experienced users to navigate the rapidly evolving world of digital collectibles and blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this app, makes it really easy to keep non-store apps up to date by linking directly to the apps GitHub repo for example.Obviously you have to be careful what you install, just as with any app not found in Play Store, but if you're getting your apps elsewhere anyway this is really convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use this and it's great. Only problem is when: 1) you want something outside of github (from my experience, already gitlab and codeberg can be buggy here, although very rarely), and 2) when you need a specific release channel (example: Firefox Beta, which requires a bit of work). But overall it works great. Now, one has to consider the security aspects: stores like Google Play (and, to a lesser extent, F-Droid) do perform some antimalware checks. It's not bulletproof, but it gives a bit more trust in case the dev goes rogue or is compromised. BUT you have to trust the store. With Obtainium, you have to trust: 1) the app's developer 2) Github/Gitlab/Codeberg 3) Obtainium's developer. So, it depends what's your threat model. I'm looking forward to seeing wider adoption for Accrescent!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's weird how many orgs keep their apps unavailable, as lots of users decline to submit to Play store preconditions (link phone to a Google account).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026251</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The website introduces Open Encoder, a project focused on enhancing large language models (LLMs) through efficient encoding techniques. It emphasizes the goals of improving performance and scalability in natural language processing tasks, offers insights into the methodologies used for optimization, and provides resources including documentation, research papers, and tools for developers interested in implementing advanced encoding strategies in their own LLM applications. Additionally, it invites collaboration and contributions from the research community to further refine these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research.Regardless of the specific performance of this model versus another model, I think it’s good to keep in mind that everyone benefits from this kind of work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just messing around with LLMs all day, so had a few test cases open. Asked it to change a few things in a ~6KB C# snippet in a somewhat ambiguous, but reasonable way.GPT-4 did this job perfectly. Qwen:72b did half of the job, completely missed the other one, and renamed 1 variable that had nothing to do with the question. Llama3.1:70b behaved very similar to Qwen, which is interesting.OpenCoder:8b started reasonably well, then randomly replaced "Split('\n')" with "Split(n)" in unrelated code, and then went completely berserk, hallucinating non-existent StackOverflow pages and answers.For posterity, I saved it here: https://pastebin.com/VRXYFpzrMy best guess is that you shouldn't train it on mostly code. Natural language conversations used to train other models let them "figure out" human-like reasoning. If your training set is mostly code, it can produce output that looks like code, but it will have little value to humans.Edit: to be fair, llama3.2:3b also botched the code. But it did not hallucinate complete nonsense at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering why Figure 1 showed a HumanEval score of 61.6 for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, but Table 1 shows a score of 88.4, i. e. better than this new model with a score of 66.5.The reason is that those are actually two different models (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base with 61.6, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct with 88.4).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095580</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses SVDQuant, a software tool developed by researchers at MIT for analyzing high-dimensional data using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It highlights the tool's ability to quantify and visualize features in a dataset, making it easier to interpret complex data structures. The post emphasizes SVDQuant's user-friendly interface and its applications in various fields, including biology and material science, showcasing how it enhances the understanding of large datasets through effective dimensionality reduction and data representation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one in a long line of posts saying "we took a model and made it smaller" and now it can run with different requirements.It is important to keep in mind that modifying a model changes the performance of the resulting model, where performance is "correctness" or "quality" of output.Just because the base model is very performant does not mean the smaller model is.This means that another model that is the same size as the new quantized model may outperform the quantized model.Suppose there are equal sized big models A and B with their smaller quantized variants a and b. A being a more performant model than B does not guarantee a being more performant than b.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demo on actual 4090 with flux schnell for next few hours: https://5jkdpo3rnipsem-3000.proxy.runpod.net/Its basically H100 speeds with 4090, 4.80it/s. 1.1 sec for flux schenll(4 steps) and 5.5 seconds for flux dev(25 steps). Compared to normal speeds(comfyui fp8 with "--fast" optimization") which is 3 seconds for schnell and 11.5 seconds for dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm convinced the path to ubiquity (such as embedded in smartphones) is quantization.I had to int4 a llama model to get it to properly run on my 3060.I'm curious, how much resolution / significant digits do we actually need for most genAI work? If you can draw a circle with 3.14, maybe it's good enough for fast and ubiquitous usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093112</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "Why I Quit Google," the author, Matt Lynch, shares his personal experience and reasons for leaving his job at Google. He discusses how, despite the benefits of working at a prestigious tech company, he felt increasingly disillusioned by the corporate culture, bureaucracy, and lack of meaningful impact on important projects. Lynch emphasizes the importance of passion in work and the desire for personal fulfillment, leading him to pursue new opportunities aligned with his values and interests. Overall, the piece serves as a reflection on career satisfaction and the search for a more purpose-driven path.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the same author has also published an interesting series of "annual review" blog posts summarising his progress trying to get different software businesses off the ground -- including being quite open about the finances. If you're interested in boostrapping a software business, and haven't seen them, they're well worth reading:https://mtlynch.io/tags/annual-review/https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you learned the most important lesson of any career: the customer is not your customer. The person/people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers.Think about it like this. A customer is the entity that exchanges money for something they value; like a good or service. That's usually your manager. Or in the case of OP the promotion committee. (Many times it's both your manager and the promotion committee). They are the ones who directly control your money (raise, bonus, promotion, etc).With that perspective in mind it makes sense to manage your career as a business where you're doing things to increase the rate at which you deliver value to the entity which can trade money for that value.Many of the setbacks you faced are very common when trying to run your own business. The customer changes their mind, the market shifts the goal posts, you realize you're focusing on the wrong things. Like a business you have to constantly change your strategy and adapt to the customer; not the other way around. Why? Because the customer can very easily get their goods or services from someone else if you can't deliver what they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I agree with this. The breaking projects before completion is very annoying, but also the author seems like they were only there for a promotion? I mean a promotion is nice, but it was never really explained why that was such a dealbreaker. If the only thing keeping you at your job is the prospect of a better title, that's probably a bad sign. They then made a lifetime's worth of money at Google in four years, and then used that financial stability to do something high risk which most people can't afford to do. Regardless, I'm glad they've found work that resonates with them! Hopefully they can use that financial stability to build something useful and impactful :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Jaws is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of building and deploying applications using the JAWS (JavaScript API Wrapper &amp; Scheduler) framework. It simplifies tasks such as managing dependencies, running applications, and deployment configurations, thereby enhancing productivity for developers. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and examples, making it accessible for both new and experienced users of the JAWS framework. Additionally, it emphasizes community contributions, encouraging collaboration and improvements to the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

All the JS -&gt; WASM compilers so far have basically just been shipping a whole JS engine - this is the first one I've seen that actually tries to map JS constructs directly to WASM primitives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day I did an almost-Typescript (though much closer than assembly script) to embedded ARM compiler.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential for HPV vaccination to eliminate cervical cancer globally. It highlights the significant role that human papillomavirus (HPV) plays in cervical cancer development, emphasizing how vaccination can dramatically reduce incidence rates. The piece provides data on vaccination coverage worldwide, the disparities in access between countries, and the need for increased efforts to promote vaccination programs. It also outlines the benefits of early detection and treatment, advocating for a comprehensive approach that combines vaccination with screening to achieve the goal of eradicating cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s funny how in the US the vaccine schedule says not to get the HPV vaccine if you’re over 45. That means that insurance won’t cover it and I even struggle finding a doctor who will administer it because it goes against the guidelines.The rationale is that if you’re 45, you probably already have HPV. But that assumes that you’ve been sexually active all that time. It doesn’t take into account people who were monogamous until their 50s and then started having sex with new partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we had therapeutic vaccines against HPV. As a man, I always got told "it's not for men", followed by "it is also for men, but only if you never had sex", followed by "it's also for men who had sex, but only to a limited age".As a male who meets all the criteria to be in a high risk group for HPV throat cancer, and who is dealing with a persistent HPV infection (as proved by warts that won't go away), I'm really sad that I may one day at a young age get cancer in my throat, and there is nothing I can do about it to prevent it. I wish we would put the same amount of energy into inventing vaccines that suppress the virus, or help the body to get rid of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The HPV vaccine has been a universal win for this generation.  Screening (pap smear) is also highly effective, but requires constant effort.The remaining gaps in screening and vaccine uptake reflect broader lack of health-care capabilities that won't be solved with pushing the HPV vaccine alone.  Changing from injectable to oral could help, but isn't on the table, and local populations and governments are likely to become increasingly resistant to outsiders waving their science authorities, particularly on family matters.Both authors are Phd's working in outreach - i.e., they seem to have no experience with deploying HPV campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045373</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the court's decision in Heckman v. Live Nation, where Ticketmaster's attempt to enforce arbitration clauses in its ticket purchase agreements was largely unsuccessful. The court ruled that the arbitration terms were unconscionable and unenforceable, highlighting concerns about unfairness and lack of transparency in the arbitration process. The decision sets a precedent for consumer rights, indicating that companies cannot impose one-sided arbitration clauses that could disadvantage consumers. The author emphasizes the importance of this ruling in challenging overreaching contractual practices in the ticketing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I won't agree to arbitration services at all, if it removes your right to sue.  I have been burned in the past by a manifestly unfair arbitration decision.  We submitted our evidence, they asked the other side for their response.  The other side lied, and provided no evidence.  The arbitration service simply decided in the other parties favor; we were allowed no rebuttal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitration seems like how courts-martials were in the early days... completely lopsided in favor of the State, except it's corporations now.  Either we get rid of arbitration (which I don't think is gonna happen) or there needs to be regulations to bring it under control (whatever that may be, i have no idea myself).Almost every service I use has, over time, switched me over to require the use of arbitration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US arbitration law is weird. A particularly bizarre one is that a judge did not find it possible to strike down an arbitration agreement where there arbitrator is part of the organisation being complained of:https://archive.is/mIfMs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42047027</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new technique called Early Cascade Injection, which enhances the stealthiness of code injection during the Windows process creation phase. It details how this method allows attackers to infiltrate processes more discreetly by leveraging the early stages of process initialization, thereby avoiding detection by conventional security measures. The piece emphasizes the implications for cybersecurity, urging defenders to adapt their strategies in light of this advanced injection technique.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great! We have been working on Windows Process (and COM) injection since 2003 [1][2][3]. I need to talk with the current development team about reviewing it with the EDR-Preloading technique. We have a driver also that suspends a new process before hooking it, we also hook existing processes.Business-wise our work on this went down once Microsoft Detours was made FOSS even when our products has other capabilities. A good old thread is here [4].[1] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2[2] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare-InProc[3] https://github.com/nektra/RemoteBridge[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/22crn0/gpl_alt...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all overriding and detouring is malicious.  For instance, Steam detours Direct3D every time you launch a game in order to set up the steam overlay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the call to WriteProcessMemory or creating suspended processes isn't being picked up, it usually gets you a lot of points on the "Detect binary as malware heuristic" detector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095752</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Zig, a programming language that offers a unique syntax and structure compared to traditional languages. It highlights the language's features, such as its focus on performance and safety, and provides examples of how its syntax encourages clear and concise code. The author explains various elements of the Zig programming language, including its approach to error handling, memory management, and compile-time execution, aiming to illustrate why Zig may be an appealing choice for developers seeking a more efficient and readable coding experience. Overall, the piece serves as an introduction to Zig's unconventional syntax and its benefits in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even more unfriendly-yet-typical line is where you create an allocator, and few lines further you run allocator() method on it, to get ...an allocator (but you had it already! Or maybe you didn't ?) Same: you create Writer, but then you run a writer() method on it.Here is the code to illustrate:    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();
    var visited = std.BufSet.init(arena.allocator());

    var bw = std.io.bufferedWriter(std.io.getStdOut().writer());
    const stdout = bw.writer();

So.. what are the entities we use, conceptually? "allocatorButNotReally" and "thisTimeReallyAnAllocatorIPromise"? Same for the writer?Plus, the documentation isn't much explaining wtf is this and why.The answer is probably buried somewhere in forums history, blogs and IRC logs, because there must have been consensus established why is it ok to write code like that. But, the lack of clear explanation is not helping with casual contact with the language. It's rather all-or-nothing - either you spend a lot of time daily in tracking all the media about the ecosystem, or you just don't get the basics. Not good IMO. (and yes I like a lot about the language).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As people have pointed already elsewhere, the same declaration can be made more clear by isolating the type like so:    var gpa: std.mem.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}) = .{};&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you've been writing zig for a while, seeing `.{}` in an argument list intuitively means "default arguments".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42050954</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1960s, Ford has been storing vintage cars in an underground cave in Kansas City to protect them from the elements and preserve their condition. This unique storage facility, known as the "Ford Motor Company Underground," houses over 600 vehicles, including classic models and prototypes. The initiative not only serves to safeguard automotive history but also supports future restoration and preservation efforts, showcasing the brand's commitment to its heritage. The site highlights the fascinating connection between Ford and its collection, emphasizing the significance of these vehicles in the context of the company's legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re government cheese..."The story of “government cheese” started with Jimmy Carter’s campaign promise to support the price of milk (specifically, to support a $0.06/gallon price increase). Consider it a rare campaign promise that happened to be kept, though it wasn’t completely thought through."Enforcing a higher price for something commonly either means restricting supply or increasing demand. In this case, supporting the price increase meant that the government had to buy milk en masse. What happens when you buy lots of milk? You discover that it does not keep well. That in turn led to the milk being converted into other forms that last longer: cheese, primarily. The other benefit of cheese being its greater density — producing one pound of cheese requires roughly 10 pounds of milk."But then what to do with the cheese? At first, the government just stored the cheese, where it apparently filled most of the large-scale cold storage in the US. (Rough cost for one year of the milk price support program (1981): $2 billion paid to dairy farmers in price support and $120 million in storage.)"
https://unintendedconsequenc.es/food-from-thought/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a similar facility called Iron Mountain in Boyers, PA that stores, among other things, millions of government records:https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/01/inside-iron-mountain.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a ton of facilities like this for storage of various stuff in middle America.  The limestone geology (there was once a sea between the Appalachian and Rockies) lend itself well to them.  These facilities store all manner of things, almost everyone reading this has probably eaten cheese from one of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078469</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Grim Fandango," a landmark video game released in 1998, known for its unique blend of film noir and Mexican culture as it follows the story of Manny Calavera, a travel agent in the Land of the Dead. It highlights the game's innovative use of 3D graphics and intricate storytelling, as well as its influence on the adventure game genre. The author reflects on the game's themes of life, death, and redemption, along with its memorable characters and puzzles, and considers its legacy in the gaming industry. The piece encapsulates why Grim Fandango continues to resonate with fans and maintains a significant place in video game history.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well I certainly cannot relate to the criticism. I played the game early on as a teen (and every few years since) and while, at times difficult, I never thought the puzzles were "confusing", it seemed like a pretty organic combination of styles of puzzles built into the game. The head turning dynamics I have also found to be quiet pleasant as it made me relate to the character more.Not that criticism is bad but Grim Fandango seems to one of the most if not most loved adventure games (just visit and adventure game forum or subreddit). So one can take it apart and think about the individual parts but the whole is certainly a masterpiece of a game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one understated problem Grim Fandango had is that it's too adult.Today "adult" often means "there's sex and/or gore", but the content is still simple and juvenile. But Grim Fandango isn't like that, it's just full of themes that probably confused the heck out of almost every kid that tried to play it.Like the very first chapter throws you right into office politics. You deal with stealing a job from another salesman, sabotage a pneumatic tube messaging system, and sneak into your boss' office.It all makes perfect sense for adults familiar with office work and all the movies it references. But I recall I tried it when I was maybe 14 and I couldn't make head nor tails of it. I didn't even realize the pneumatic tubes were actually a thing.Things like Monkey Island and even Full Throttle are far more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how Lua "has gone on to become a staple language of modern game development", but could have given more credit to Grim Fandango for that. It was the first game to use Lua and and its success was what put the language on the map when it comes to gamedev.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097261</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of pursuing larger, more significant opportunities or goals in life, comparing it to the metaphor of "bigger fish." It emphasizes the importance of stepping out of comfort zones and exploring new challenges that can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. The author shares insights on the mindset required to embrace these challenges and the potential rewards that come from taking risks and aiming higher.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article, neat research behind it.I think the paper's contributions really don't have anything to do with ML; it's about the new side channel with interrupts, which is a cool find. ML just gets more people to read it, which I guess is ok. I mean, you could just use "statistics" here in much the same way.I remember an advisor once telling me: once you figure out what a paper is really about, rewrite it, and remove the stuff you used to think it was about. The title of this paper should be about the new side channel, not about the ML story, imho.But this is just a nitpick. Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderful article. I never thought I'll be able to understand side-channel attacks so easily.The article read like a murder mystery where you know who the villain is right in the beginning but you need to find it how they did it!Marked as favorite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is awesome, your writing is super approachable and the interactive demos are really cool.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing trend of climate migration, where individuals and communities are forced to relocate due to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and dwindling resources. It highlights various case studies from around the world, illustrating how entire populations are being displaced and the associated challenges they face, including legal recognition and humanitarian aid. The article emphasizes the need for global action and policies to address the root causes of climate change and support affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was remarkably little in the way of security for early satellites (or space probes).I recently encountered here on HN the suggestion that, the main reason you can't find particularly in-depth details on the Voyager space probes, is project security.  Security through obscurity, mostly.  If amateurs can detect the signal from the Voyager probes with a small dish antenna, it's at least conceivable someone might hook up a really powerful transmitter, aim it in the probe's direction, and start issuing commands.  There's no cryptography, of course.  The resources required to hijack like that in the 1970s would have been much greater, and I doubt being hacked was much on the designer's minds.The Apollo Program was the same; today anyone with the documentation, a small dish antenna, a software radio, and some nerd dedication, would be able to hack Apollo midflight via its radio link.  It was the equivalent of a root prompt with no password on an exposed port.A bit closer to home, there's a tremendous amount of semi-functional orbital junk with a similar lack of security, decades-old computers still waiting for telecommands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This didn't happen recently. From the article:&gt;Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about."There was one of these just a couple weeks ago (and that was not the first),https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41904346 ("Intelsat 33e breaks up in geostationary orbit")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093851</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;OuteTTS is a text-to-speech model developed by OuteAI, designed to generate human-like speech from written text. It is based on a robust architecture with 350 million parameters, enabling it to produce high-quality audio outputs. The model is suitable for various applications, including voiceovers for videos, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. The page provides details on how to use the model, its capabilities, and links to access it on the Hugging Face platform, along with sample outputs to demonstrate its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW I was really impressed by the results of F5-TTS. The thing I liked best was the "Tagged" TTS, where you can specify a tag to use different tones of your own voice, like  {Angry}What have you done?
  {Suprised}Me, I did nothing?
  {Shouting}Who else do you think I'm talking to?
  {Sad}Why are you always shouting at me?

I wonder if this would also work for "Character" tags, like  {Susan}How was your day?
  {Peter}I had a great day.

That would open great new ways of having audio books read by cloned voices - switching between characters with the same voice like often done by the real narrators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a quick try results aren't good. Sounds bland, and the text I type isn't exactly equal to the text that is spoken. Didn't try with voice cloning though.Why is good TTS so expensive and why are there no good open source options? Is it just from the need for high quality training data? I don't imagine these models are more expensive to run compared to SOTA LLMs, yet they cost so much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve had great luck so far with GPT-SoVITS. With a custom trained Japanese model and clean reference audio the quality is outstanding. It is quite finicky to set up and use though.https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043967</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice. I've had occasion to import/export, edit, etc. thousands of CSV files from multiple software platforms over the years and this tool looks like a simple way for a user to determine whether there are issues in the CSV file that will cause problems on import to their application.One question I immediately have is how this compares to a spreadsheet CSV import tool such as the one in Excel which is extremely flexible. It appears that this app requires a specific format (comma delimited, new line at end of each row) in order to work. I never tried to count the times that a CSV file that I had to work with required editing in order to facilitate import to Excel or other application because CSV is such a non-standard standard output that the only way one could know whether the import would be successful was to pop it into an editor, like Notepad++ and examine it before import. Notepad++ was a critical tool in the chain to force compliance for all the different applications I used. Each application allowed CSV import/export but some accepted almost any delimiter while others were strict about file format and failing to understand the expected CSV format for each would definitely cause headaches as some input errors could leave a very subtle footprint that you may not catch until late in processing.Anyway, it appears that your definition of CSV format is pretty strict so how do you propose that a user manage importation of files that do not fit your CSV definition? Notepad++ before import to verify compliance?I also see one thing on the main page under "Security" that looks like it could be worded differently.&gt;No tracking or analytics software is used for privacyTo me, this implies that no steps have been taken to manage user/data privacy.Perhaps a comma could be inserted so that it reads "...used, for privacy." or maybe it should read:For (user/data) privacy, there is no tracking or analytics software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work!Do you have any plans for data cleaning?I am working on a somewhat similar open source project.  I intend to add heuristic data cleaning.  With the UI I want to be able to toggle between different strategies quickly - strip characters from a column to treat it as numeric, if less than 2% or 5% of values have a character, fill na with mean, interpret dates in different formats - drop if the date doesn't parse.  The idea bing that if it's really quick to change between different strategies, you can create more opinionated strategies to get to the right answer faster.Happy to collaborate and talk tables with anyone who's interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool!

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a concise history of Cyrix, a company known for its role in the x86 processor market during the 1990s. It discusses the foundation of Cyrix in 1988, its development of innovative processors that aimed to compete with Intel and AMD, and its strategic partnerships and product releases. The piece highlights the company's challenges, including legal battles and market competition, which ultimately led to its acquisition by VIA Technologies in 1999. It reflects on Cyrix's legacy and contributions to computing, especially in enhancing performance and affordability during the era.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I owe my entire career to the high school internship I had in the IT department at Cyrix in Richardson, circa 1996. It was awesome. Learned everything about building PCs for employees and Windows networking. So much free hardware walked out the door -- usually stuff that was slightly out of date, just stacks of it everywhere.  Spent the next three summers there through college too. It was really exciting there at that time, Internet age just taking off. They had beer at 4PM on Fridays out back.Everything went downhill with the series of acquisitions. Anyway, I'm grateful for my time there... I can trace where I am now directly back to the guy who first gave me a chance there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s very interesting to learn about Cyrix and how innovative they happened to be. Back in the 90s most of us, at least in Europe, learned about Cyrix from either friends or shop clerks. And back then Cyrix had a terrible reputation, they were considered almost as illegal Intel CPU clones. AMD also had a terrible reputation until they released their Socket 7 AMD K6 CPUs and later on their Super Socket 7 K6-2, K6-3 CPU’s just before their amazing Athlon and Duron family. Cyrix never regained any reputation, and slowly their offerings ended up mixed with VIA or Centaur CPUs. Celeron and AMD CPU’s were already cheap enough so no one was buying Cyrix anymore to just save $20-$30 on a $1000 computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a Cyrix 486 somewhere around 1992. Working with Windows NT and Visual C++ turned up subtle problems that could be worked around with some compiler switches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42035990</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Write a Book" on Parenthetically Speaking provides a comprehensive guide for aspiring authors, outlining the key steps to successfully write and publish a book. It emphasizes the importance of defining one's purpose, creating a writing schedule, and developing a clear outline. Additionally, the article offers tips on drafting, revising, and seeking feedback, as well as advice on navigating the publishing process, whether through traditional publishing or self-publishing. The overall aim is to empower writers by demystifying the writing process and encouraging them to share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree. I DID write a book! https://howtoopensource.dev/My biggest tip is this: Don’t skip getting beta readers. High quality feedback is really hard to come by. I changed my tool chain to add a google form at the end of each chapter and got strong buy in from a handful of people with the finished first draft in a beta state. In the end some bailed but one left amazing feedback resulting in massive structural changes.The process of writing a book is two things (to me). The most obvious is sharing information. The second, often overlooked, but biggest benefit IMHO is how you will grow and learn the source material even better than you already do. Even if you don’t ever publish it, it’s still worthwhile to putting in the effort to write a book. GLHF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a university lecturer, I have interviewed many people… academics and admins. I have taught in many S E Asian universities and multi-lingualism is the norm, with English assumed to be the ‘Lingua franca’. Almost everyone I interview claims to have ‘excellent’ skills in written and spoken English. Almost none of them could produce so much as a single paragraph of English that did not burn my eyes.Prior to starting writing my first book, I had already accumulated some experience in academic writing. I thought it would be a doddle. I can honestly say that it was one of the most demanding experiences of my life.The worst thing is the degree to which I was blind to my own shortcomings… just like all those people I interviewed.Moral of the story… "writing is easy; you just stare at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead"  (Gene Fowler).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The challenge is not writing a book, but letting it go.I wrote Understanding SEO https://fullstackoptimizatio.gumroad.com/l/understanding-seo...4 times. Each time it took me a year. The last time together with an editor. And I could have gone on, over every word, every sentence again. In the end my editor forces me.  In the end you just have to publish it, otherwise it does not exist.Still think I did good, even after more than 7 years I still sell a few paper and some more e copies per month just by WOM, so yeah, must be some value in there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42096915</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent breakthrough in cancer research, highlighting a study that reveals a novel method for targeting specific cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. It emphasizes the potential of this approach to increase treatment efficacy and reduce side effects commonly associated with traditional therapies. The authors express optimism about the implications for future cancer treatments and stress the importance of ongoing research to validate these findings and explore their applicability across different types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

I am happy that the researchers are putting it out there to attract interest and investment, but the GRI-type insulins remained in lab settings for about 30 years now and it is somewhat troubling to not see progression into and through the stages of pharma clinical trials on T1D patients.Clearly, there is tremendous potential to make money here – diabetes is a very serious epidemic worldwide. So why hasn't this progressed out of the lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO: This is the closest thing to a "cure" coming out in the next decade. Like a couple injections a day, wearing a CGM to make sure it is working, no calculations, no worry about carb intake.A lot of the other "cures"  involve immunosuppressants which have a ton of bad side effects that can be worse than diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008891</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of social media on mental health, highlighting both the potential benefits and risks. It emphasizes how social platforms can foster community and support for individuals facing mental health challenges, while also warning about issues such as cyberbullying, anxiety, and the pressure to curate a perfect online presence. The piece calls for a more nuanced understanding of social media's role in mental wellbeing, suggesting that responsible usage and awareness of its effects are crucial for healthier online interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cases like Tom Perez should never happen. He was held for the murder of his father who was alive.

And your agedmother will have to pay the fines, making her homeless."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never talk to the police. Do not "just give a statement" to get them to let you go.Identify yourself when asked, ask for a lawyer, then shut up.If communicating something to the police might be helpful for you, do that through your lawyer."You can beat the charges but you can't beat the ride"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091423</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Saturn V rocket's unique fueldraulic gimbal system, which was a critical technology that allowed for precise control over the rocket's engine orientation. It explains how the system uses hydraulic fluid combined with fuel to generate the necessary movement and stability during flight. The piece highlights the advantages of the fueldraulic system over traditional mechanical gimbal mechanisms, detailing its impact on the success of Apollo missions and providing insights into its engineering principles and applications in aerospace technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short but interesting answer about why "fueldraulic" systems are still used, including on the Boeing 777, and F35: https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/24787/why-is-fu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the Saturn V was retired, they put one out in the front yard of the Johnson Space Center.It was kind of sizable, and for years you could see it when you drove by on NASA Road 1.Laying sideways where the different stages were laid end-to-end, and walk right up and touch it, with outdoor photo ops all over the place.Eventually they built buildings to enclose it, which you now have to go inside if you want to take a look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love those mid-century names: FuelDraulic, Hydra-Glide, PowerGlide, Ultramatic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045830</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Body Keeps the Score is a brilliant but difficult read. Do recommend it.https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study is specifically about "learning" that takes place without interacting with the brain.It's learning in the same sense the immune system learns to fight of infections. The difference is that the mechanism by which cells record state is similar to one of the mechanisms also used by the brain at the cellular level, which you would expect.The cells and structures that make up the brain evolved from simpler structures, so we would expect some reuse of mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings up the question about whether there are hereditary information transmission methods other than DNA. There are so many things we ascribe to “instinct” that might be information transmitted from parent to offspring in some encoded format.Like songs that newborn songbirds know, migration routes that animals know without being shown, that a mother dog should break the amniotic sac to release the puppies inside, what body shapes should be considered  more desirable for a mate out of an infinite variety of shapes.It seems it implausible to me that all of these things can be encoded as chemical signalling; it seems to require much more complex encoding of information, pattern matching, templates, and/or memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094427</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on optimizing database performance in Ruby on Rails applications using ActiveRecord. It highlights common performance bottlenecks and provides practical strategies for improvement, such as eager loading associations, optimizing database queries, using appropriate indexing, and caching strategies. The author emphasizes the importance of monitoring and profiling to identify specific areas for optimization, and offers several tools and techniques to enhance database efficiency and overall application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you start hitting performance issues with Rails, switch to using Arel for queries and pump the data into lightweight classes. ActiveRecord optimization magic is a foot bazooka.If you want to reuse the code between these objects and the corresponding ActiveRecord model, do it with a module.The biggest problem with Rails is that people get so glued to the conventions that everything gets shoehorned into a model or controller instead of using a better abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another approach are materialized views, where you basically create a caching table with exactly the fields you need. Can be used for any query, but particularly valuable for rich reporting where you may be pulling data from all over your associations. It requires you to write the source query in raw SQL, but with the Scenic gem, pulls it into the Active Record ecosystem with models, migrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post covering many of the main ways to improve efficiency.Here’s a related post I wrote for AppSignal:What's Coming in Ruby on Rails 7.2: Database Features in Active Record https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/07/24/whats-coming-in-ruby-o...For folks interested in additional depth on optimizing Postgres for use with Active Record/Rails, please check out my book:High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails https://andyatkinson.com/pgrailsbookThanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42059650</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth mentioning that, in Star Trek’s universe, tables were routinely covered in PADDs - not because it’s excessive, but that even with eink the most usable environment was multiple virtual sheets of paper at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a heavy ReMarkable user, mostly as a note taking device when doing client meetings.For personal use I use it a lot for annotating philosophy papers and source materials, and the lack of a split screen feature is extremely frustrating.Writing annotations or commentaries on texts means writing in the margins or switching back and forth between books (often a paper book and the remarkable for writing, or 2 notebooks in the device which is a slow operation).A split screen mode would have been extremely useful, or lacking that a method for having a page-matched 'fold-out' so I can just associate a full blank page to each source page for my commentary.I know there's an unofficial hack that adds this, but why ReMarkable doesn't I can't fathom, especially as annotations and such are marketed as primary use cases for the device./rant :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After a few days of using Daylight Computer, I have to admit that it solves all the pain points I had with Remarkable 2:- 60 FPS screen makes a huge difference in reading experience, especially if you want to flip through a PDF quickly- It's an Android tablet, meaning that I can use my usual programs and don't have an awkward "how do I bring it to Remarkable and back" processThe downsides:- It's $729 vs $379 for the Remarkable 2- It's heavierHowever, I'm not going back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42056654</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses iterative alpha deblending, a technique used in computer graphics to improve the quality of images that have been blended with transparency. It explains the challenges of traditional alpha blending, particularly in preserving detail and achieving realistic results. The author presents a method for refining the blending process through iterative calculations, which helps in eliminating artifacts and enhances the visual fidelity of the final image. Additionally, practical implementation details and examples are provided to guide readers in applying this technique in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a letter discussing the philosophical ideas of Nikolai Fyodorov, emphasizing his vision of a future where humanity overcomes death and achieves resurrection through technological and spiritual means. The author reflects on Fyodorov's influence on contemporary thought, highlighting themes of human responsibility towards the deceased, the potential for collective progress, and the ethical implications of scientific advancements. The letter encourages readers to consider how Fyodorov's ideas can guide modern society in addressing existential challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fyodorov's philosophy is a key driver of the plot of the trilogy of novels by Hannu Rajaniemi, starting with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has some similarity to Tipler's "omega point" hypothesis iin his 1994 book "The Physics of Immortality" [1]. I read this years ago but have recently bought it again to have another look at. It seems to be a PDF on the Internet Archive as well. It was a very wild idea.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Tipler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those in LA, there’s a related exhibit at the Museum of Jurassic Technology.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of ham radio operators during the New York Marathon to enhance communication and safety for the event. It highlights how these volunteers provide crucial support by relaying information about the race, assisting with medical emergencies, and ensuring that organizers can communicate effectively across the vast event. The piece underscores the importance of amateur radio in emergency situations and public events, showcasing the skills and dedication of the ham radio community.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where's Nextel PTT when you need it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see coverage of ham radio volunteers here! The Boston Marathon has a similar volunteer-led program which I've participated in since college [1]. It's such a fun event and a great way to combine technical interests with community service. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to join a community of like-minded technical folks. The group isn't what the "old men with radios" stereotype would suggest either.[1] https://www.arrl.org/news/amateur-radio-provides-communicati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick plug for anyone who may be interested in ham but a little intimidated by the license that’s required. Contact your local ham club or group (I guarantee you there is one). Ours had a fast track to getting people licensed. It amounted to a one day cram course immediately before the technician’s exam (the oddly named entry level license) with a 90+% pass rate. The philosophy is to get people licensed and on board and interested and THEN start learning. It’s kind of a counter intuitive strategy but it certainly got me involved where I wouldn’t have been otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037750</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NASA's lack of communication regarding an incident involving a SpaceX Crew Dragon splashdown that resulted in crew members being sent to the hospital. Despite the significance of the event, NASA has not publicly addressed the situation or provided details about what occurred during the re-entry and landing process. The lack of transparency raises concerns among space enthusiasts and experts about safety protocols and the handling of emergencies in space missions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the kind of headline that would appear 20 minutes into a B-rate sci-fi movie.As we approach Act II, an intrepid young journalist rushes to the hospital to find out what’s really going on… But wait, who is in the black car trailing her?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people seem to deal with long-term zero-G better than others. The cosmonaut who spent the longest continuous time in space was Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 days in zero G in the early 1990s, came back fine, had a good career after returning, and recently died at age 80.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could it be an initially-unnoticed chemical leak in the Crew Dragon? That could explain how it hospitalized four astronauts at once, and also why they're uncharacteristically afraid of media coverage. They were evasive in a similar way when Starliner was first having issues—they're scared of the politics, or of the lawyers.edit to add: These spacecraft all use very toxic fuels, and this one has had issues with fuel leaks before [0]. I'm not sure how or if those could affect the crew. Maybe if there was contamination on an exterior surface, they could have been exposed on landing? IIRC it is or used to be standard procedure to take air samples before opening crewed spacecraft, for this reason.edited again to add: I found it! It Apollo-Soyuz in 1975—the entire Apollo crew were poisoned by fuel when they opened the spacecraft, and were hospitalized with chemical pneumonitis [1,2].[0] https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-delays-cargo-dr... ("NASA and SpaceX stand down on Dragon launch to study hydrazine issue")[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo–Soyuz#Re-entry_and_afte...[2] https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19770023791 ("The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Medical report")- (wiki) "The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by unignited reaction control system (RCS) hypergolic propellants venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in Honolulu, Hawaii.[22] Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believed he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and begun drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.[23]"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42092385</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the long-term effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) since its enactment in 1990, highlighting both its successes and shortcomings. It examines how the ADA has contributed to increased accessibility and rights for individuals with disabilities, while also critiquing areas where implementation has fallen short. The article presents a nuanced perspective on the ADA's impact on various aspects of society, including employment, education, and public spaces, ultimately advocating for continued efforts to improve and enforce disability rights.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in trying Ada out, I wrote a a Rustup-like app that installs Ada's package manager (Alire) on macOS and Linux: https://www.getada.devIt was also featured on HN (194 points | 6 months ago | 117 comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40132373I've gone from not having anything Ada related on my computer to installing the toolchain, initiating a project , writing, compiling, and running "Hello World" in less then 2 minutes.Ada has had something of a resurgence in the last couple years, with the latest standard (2022) officially released and for the first time in a few years, Ada has its own dev room at FOSDEM! https://fosdem.org/2025/news/2024-10-28-devrooms-announced/There's also a growing community at ada-lang.io with a thriving forum: https://forum.ada-lang.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It being a one-pass compiler bugs me (there is no excuse for a modern language to require forward declarations).He refers to the need for forward declarations as "one-pass compiler".  Historically at least, Ada compilers were infamous for requiring many passes and being consequently slow.Whether it is still acceptable for a programming language to require forward declaration seems to me rather a matter of personal taste.  Sure, compilers improved and there's plenty of memory for them to use, but human programmers' capacity increased little, if any, I'd think.  I think of those forward declarations as form of double-entry bookkeeping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once did an engineering camp at the Air Force academy and in one of the classes we programmed Lego mindstorms with Ada - something like https://www.adacore.com/academia/projects/real-time-mindstor...I do wish we had better options for embedded!

&lt;p&gt;The article details a vulnerability found in SQLite, which can be exploited through a bit-flipping attack. This type of attack manipulates the binary representation of data to alter its meaning or behavior when processed by the database, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access or corrupt data. The author explains how such vulnerabilities can arise, emphasizing the importance of security measures in database management and providing insights into the technical aspects of the SQLite architecture that enable these exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL, one of the most popular databases for reliable data management, also does not enable this feature by default."By default, data pages are not protected by checksums, but this can optionally be enabled for a cluster. "
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.htmlI feel it's quite unfair for the title to call out sqlite on checksums, when in reality, as the very closing line of the article states most databases don't do checksum verifications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sqlite is the wrong layer at which to care about storage hardware failures. That would be the job of the disks themselves, the hardware or software volume manager, or filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The checksum in the WAL is to detect incomplete writes (due to crash or power failure). That data was never committed successfully. Throwing an error for this scenario would mean that sqlite is unable to recover from a crash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094663</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article addresses common misconceptions about SQLite, clarifying its capabilities and limitations. It highlights that SQLite is not just a lightweight database for small applications but is also capable of handling complex workloads and concurrent transactions effectively. It dispels myths regarding its performance and scalability, emphasizing that SQLite is suitable for a variety of applications beyond mobile and embedded systems. The piece aims to educate readers on the true nature of SQLite and its appropriate use cases, encouraging a more informed perspective on database choices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing from this, but very important: you can connect to the same SQLite database file multiple times inside the same process (e.g. in different threads) but you can also connect to the same SQLite database file from multiple different processes on the same machine (with the same filesystem - NFS will lead to all kinds of nasty problems).Easy way to prove this to yourself: run two different terminals, run "sqlite3 data.db" in each one, run create table / insert / update queries in one and watch the results become visible to selects in the other.Changes only become visible to other connections after they have been committed.In default mode any writes will hold an exclusive lock and will cause any reads to be blocked waiting for that lock. In WAL mode reads can continue even while writes are taking place.Writes can only run one at a time, but can queue waiting for each other to finish - and since most writes take microseconds to run this is very rarely a problem.The most complicated thing to understand is the need to use BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION in concurrent environments to avoid the occasional SQLITE_BUSY exception. The best explanation I've seen of this is here: https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-rails-t... - search for SQLITE_BUSY.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just dealt with a lot of sqlite concurrency stuff recently. When I first got started, a lot of recommendations were that apps should create a connection and hold that connection its the duration. This works great but I feel like it's worth noting that this can get dangerous when you're working in a multi-threaded context.You can have one thread in the middle of stepping through the results of a SELECT prepared statement and if another thread resets the statement and runs it again, that original thread will start stepping through the results from the other thread's call.  Or if both threads begin a transaction, you'll get nested transaction errors.Things get really confusing, especially because you might not notice the problems until the app is running on a slower machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are benefits to having a single writer connection (and multiple readers).One is that you can get fairer and more efficient locking. The (interruptible) file lock APIs that SQLite uses lead to a lot of sleeping and retrying that wastes time, and is not very fair.https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/07/19/sqlite-in-ruby-ba...Another some APIs, like the backup API, work better if they can track writes, and (e.g.) backing up from the single writer connection helps there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095012</guid></item><item><title>46.

It emphasizes the importance of fostering education, promoting creativity, and developing skills that encourage higher-level thinking to address the challenges posed by this deficit.

Maybe you just don’t hear about it because it’s “boring”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software engineering and finance have completely sucked the air out of the STEM room.I'll be surprised if in a generation anyone in the US knows how to build anything other than JavaScript apps and swap agreements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post doesn't address the elephant in the room -- wages in biology seem to be supressed due to an oversupply of life sciences scientists willing to do tasks in various corporate and academic labs.Since life science wages (rewards) seem to be so low compared to other careers in relation to the density of advanced degree holders, the ambitions need to be that much bigger to make it worth it to found uncertain and risky startups. Only big ideas would be worth funding. Ecosystem tooling startups might be founded once more capital for that category trickles in.&gt;&gt;And I have no doubt that Patrick Collinson — the CEO of Stripe [...]Patrick's last name is Collison, not Collinson, as per the wikipedia link that the blog post references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095513</guid></item><item><title>47.

I can't stress how important his talk was in the overall success of htmx, and I'm glad he followed up on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My only counter is that for a real-time collaborative app the server should be the single source of truth about application state, which would make htmx a good choice for that type of application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any major websites using htmx?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091909</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;NASA is enhancing medical support for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by establishing a hospital on the station. This initiative aims to address healthcare needs in space, enabling better management of medical emergencies and routine health monitoring. The project signifies a significant advancement in astronaut care, reflecting the increasing importance of health and safety as space missions extend in duration and complexity. The hospital will be equipped with necessary medical technology and staffed by experts to ensure astronaut well-being during missions.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether there was another illness or emergency who knows. But the shock of sudden gravity could trigger things.I think this type of headline just gets views because people want to believe they made alien contact or something ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093560</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You'd better not dare write your desktop application in HTML. What has this world come to???Ok thats clear. But then ten sentences later:&gt; Of course, you aren't going to write your UI in C, only an idiot would do that. Instead, you want to write it in some kind of markup language.Now, let me think of some markup language that is universally known and has at least some pretence to be about laying out information on a screen... Thats right, html.The thing with UI frameworks in the 21st century of flying cars, AGI and rapidly approaching Singularity, is that its a stagnating mess.There should be a nice, standardized, cross-platform, easy to get started and progressively expandable way to build high quality visual apps. For some elusive reason, we cant have good things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trivial examples of Gtk+ apps seem to be legion but to find a decent tutorial that works its way through a moderately complex and usable app seem to be scarce.  In particular I haven't found a decent example of using the GTKBuilder class and complete documentation of the XML properties seems almost nonexistent.Aside from that, instead of writing a GNOME app in C, isn't Vala or GJS the preferred language now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post but the images don't load for me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070807</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The content showcases a collection of high-quality images and illustrations, emphasizing digital art and photography. It highlights the creative works of the artist, focusing on aesthetic compositions and vibrant visuals. The platform serves as a portfolio, aiming to engage viewers and promote the artist's style and vision in the realm of visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Apple uses the ‘IMG_XXXX’ naming convention for all images and videos captured on iOS devices, where XXXX is a unique sequence number.For what it's worth, Apple are just conforming to the JEITA/CIPA DCF standard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_Camera_File_sy...“DCF file names” specification sez… http://www.kronometric.org/phot/std/DC-009-2010_E.pdf#page=2...“File names conforming to the following rules are called DCF file names.• The file name is 8 characters (not including the file extension).• The first four characters consist only of the upper-case alphanumeric characters shown in Table 1• These are referred to as the DCF file name Free characters. They shall not contain two-byte characters or special codes.• The four characters that follow are a number between "0001" and "9999". "0000" shall not be used. These four digits are referred to as File number.• Files with the same file number stored in the same DCF directory are considered to be object component files as defined in 4.3.2.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website http://astronaut.io/ does a similar thing but for recent videos, and not just from iPhones. From the home page:&gt; These videos come from YouTube. They were uploaded in the last week and have titles like DSC 1234 and IMG 4321. They have almost zero previous views. They are unnamed, unedited, and unseen (by anyone but you).At one point you might be at a school recital in Malaysia, and the next minute you are at a birthday in Ecuador. It's amazing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little bit tangent, and I'm definitely looking at it from rose colored glasses... but been playing with it for the 30 minutes, and most of the videos look so real? Like when you go on TikTok / Instagram nowadays, there are obviously unlimited amount of content. But there's this sense of everything being edited multiple times, people trying to create their own "brand", nothing looking real. It's a shame how we over-financialized everything and sucked out the fun. Or maybe I just got old.Side note, I'll also recommend people to look up "X city in 1990s / 2000s" on YouTube. San Francisco, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Toronto, London and etc. have cool slice of life content from people who were very into camcorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102506</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;IronCalc is a web-based tool designed for users to calculate the weight and specifications of various iron and steel materials used in construction and fabrication. The site allows users to input specific dimensions and receive precise calculations, including weight, volume, and surface area. It aims to simplify the design process for engineers, architects, and builders by providing quick access to essential material data and enabling efficient project planning and estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was an excel enthusiast and studied accounting mainly for Excel. Although I have moved to programming unlike most I still do think Excel is awesome.I sincerely commend the enthusiasm, but working in the industry as the "excel expert", I think most outsider does not understand the "cult" aspect of Excel.Excel works. That is it.Trying to replace excel with anything will be percieved as replacing a calculator with some alien substance that does math. Excel is like Pencil and Pen. You can not replace it.Excel is not software it is a tool.I have had my fair share backlash when trying to introduce replacement and complimentary tools. To replace excel, you not only need to  advocate for it's usefulness and you need to be also be liable to the complaints from excel users. If anything goes wrong no how minor with the new tool, you are the one who introduced all these mess.So, in practice what usually happens is that, when people hit UX challenges they go to a consulting firm and commission a backoffice software to address the Excel limitations. Some business may pay for nocode but that is very rare. They go to backoffice software firm and they build a CRUD software that is now not replacing Excel but compliments it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! This is my project!
Amazed to see this here.
I'll try to answer questions people might have&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cool project, but I don't particularly like "The democratization of spreadsheets" as a catchphrase. Like, what does that even mean? If by "democratization" you mean like, more able to be used, well anyone can go download LibreOffice or for the web use CryptPad's Spreadsheets, and if you mean that it's more open, well both of those are open source. Is this project specifically run democratically or something? It just seems like a really bad use of meaningless marketing terminology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095292</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the city of Neft Daslari, an oil-rich region located in the Caspian Sea, highlighting its unique features and the challenges it faces due to environmental concerns and the global shift towards renewable energy. Constructed on stilts over water, Neft Daslari has a rich history tied to oil production, but its future is uncertain as climate change impacts and changing energy policies threaten its viability. The piece explores the juxtaposition of its industrial legacy against the backdrop of growing awareness about climate issues and the need for sustainable practices in the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

One of our stops was supposed to be a fishing village, but when we got there, it was completely empty. Hundreds of mud huts sat abandoned as everyone had just disappeared. In one of the yards, a camel was still there. It felt haunting, like walking through a ghost town. The strangest part? There was no sea anywhere nearby! The Caspian had dried up so quickly that people had to leave their homes behind because they couldn’t live there anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is another very interesting field built over swamps and lakes in Siberia where they built the rigs on artificial islands.https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/99/42/41/1000_F_199424123_E5...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samotlor_Field?useskin=vectorhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/nq28Ct4FLyBGx5eP8It was deemed too strategically important and was not put on maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's another article about Neft Daşları with more photos: https://web.archive.org/web/20240225112359/https://guerrilla...Bing Maps shows the bridges and some platforms with good resolution: https://www.bing.com/maps?cp=40.061519%7E49.607735&amp;lvl=12.0&amp;...Yandex Maps shows the constellation of isolated platforms to the south-east: https://yandex.com/maps/?l=sat%2Cskl&amp;ll=49.630795%2C40.03939...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42060750</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article on audio decomposition by Matthew Bird explores various techniques and methods for breaking down and analyzing audio components. It discusses the significance of decomposition in understanding sound design and music production, detailing tools and software that facilitate this process. The author emphasizes the artistic and technical implications of dissecting audio, ultimately highlighting how these practices can enhance creativity and improve overall audio quality in various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is a bit confusing as open-source separation of ... reads like source separation, which this is not. Rather, it is a pitch detection algorithm which also classifies the instrument the pitch originated with.I think it's really neat, but the results look like it could take more time to fix the output than using a manual approach (if really accurate results are required).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see it referenced directly anywhere in this post. However, for those interested, automatic music transcription (i.e., audio-&gt;MIDI) is actually a decently sized subfield of deep learning and music information retrieval.There have been several successful models for multi-track music transcription - see Google's MT3 project (https://research.google/pubs/mt3-multi-task-multitrack-music...). In the case of piano transcription, accuracy is nearly flawless at this point, even for very low-quality audio:https://github.com/EleutherAI/aria-amtFull disclaimer: I am the author of the above repo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in audio (or stem) separation have a look at RipXhttps://hitnmix.com/ripx-daw-pro/It can even export the separated tracks as midi files. It still has some problems but works very well. Stem separation is now standard in the musical software and almost every DAW provides it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098491</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Shader Blocks explores the concept of using shader programming in graphics and game development, focusing on the use of simplified "blocks" to create visual effects. It provides an overview of how shader blocks can be utilized to manipulate light, color, and texture in a more intuitive way. The content includes examples, tutorials, and insights aimed at helping both beginners and experienced developers understand and implement shader techniques in their projects. Overall, it highlights the creative possibilities and technical aspects of integrating shaders into digital art and design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of suggestions.A clearer mechanism to indicate when a dragged component will fit into a cell of another node.   Quite often when you drag the highlighted drop area is obscured by the node you are dragging.pow(a,b) and abs(b), max(a,b), min(a,b) nodes would add a lot of functionality.Then you could do something like.    (((1 / abs((((0 - (y-0.5)) * 6) - ((sin(((((x-0.5) * 6) + time) * ((cos(time) / 3) + 2))) / 4) + pow(((x-0.5) * 2), 3))))) / 9) + (0 - pow((1 - min(abs((x-0.5), abs((y-0.5))), pow(9, 9))))

Which should generate a field with axis lines in negative numbers and a plot of x^3 modulated with a slight wobbly sine wave as positive numbers.as seen at https://c50.fingswotidun.com/show/?code=10v-6*u6*t%2Btc3%2F2...(note - in my thing u and v are shorthand values for 0.5-x and 0.5-y respectively)A perlin noise can add a lot too but not as trivial to add.  I have a compact perlin generator in the first few lines of https://c50.fingswotidun.com/fastStackie.js
which uses hashing to generate indexed random numbers, rather than a lookup table that sometimes gets used for Perlin.  Feel free to use the code if you understand any of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of node-based compositing, which is mostly standard in the film industry but, to the best of my knowledge, never made it to still-image editing applications. After doing things the nodal way, it’s hard for me to use Photoshop nowadays and have to bake-in certain changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of node based image editors https://gist.github.com/SMUsamaShah/c923a0af4543ee2746979328...But none of these is doing it all using shaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039296</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered a unique skeleton comprised of bones from at least eight individuals, each having died thousands of years apart, at a site in England. This perplexing find raises questions about the site's historical use and the cultural practices of the people who buried their dead in this manner. Researchers are investigating whether the skeleton represents a ritualistic amalgamation of remains or a more practical approach to burial. The discovery highlights the complexities of ancient burial customs and the potential for new insights into human history and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe we should add some bones, bury the skeleton again and wipe all records of what we did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine you're just fucking around with something because you're bored and then leave it there and forget about it and 2000 years later archaeologists find it and wonder "how odd, I wonder what the deep significance of this might be"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Whether the assembly of the bones occurred in the late Neolithic or in the Roman period, the presence of the ‘individual’ was clearly intentional,” write the researchers.”I would like the researchers to explain to me what hypotheses they consider to suggest that in the Neolithic they had bones from the Roman period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097856</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the Frontier Math Benchmark, an evaluation framework designed to assess the mathematical capabilities of artificial intelligence models, particularly in areas such as problem-solving and numerical reasoning. It outlines the benchmark's structure, which includes diverse problem types and complexity levels, aiming to provide standardized metrics for comparing AI performance. The initiative seeks to enhance understanding of AI’s strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, facilitating advancements in AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some context on why this is important: this benchmark was designed to be extremely challenging for LLMs, with problems requiring several hours or days of work by expert mathematicians. Currently, LLMs solve 2% of problems in the set (which is kept private to prevent contamination).They even provide a quote from Terence Tao, which helped create the benchmark (alongside other Field medalists and IMO question writers):&gt; “These are extremely challenging. I think that in the near term basically the only way to solve them, short of having a real domain expert in the area, is by a combination of a semi-expert like a graduate student in a related field, maybe paired with some combination of a modern AI and lots of other algebra packages…”Surprisingly, prediction markets [1] are putting 62% on AI achieving &gt; 85% performance on the benchmark before 2028.[1]: https://manifold.markets/MatthewBarnett/will-an-ai-achieve-8...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding keeping the test set private to avoid contamination, the comments about leakage are spot on. The real test set should always be the future.We should evaluate LLMs on text from beyond their knowledge cutoff date, by computing their per-byte perplexity or per-byte compression ratio. There's a deep theoretical connection between compression and learning.The intuition here is that being able to predict the future of science (or any topic, really) is indicative of true understanding. Slightly more formally: When ICLR 2025 announces and publishes the accepted papers, Yoshua Bengio is less surprised/perplexed by what's new than a fresh PhD student. And Terence Tao is less surprised/perplexed by what will be proven in math in the next 10 years than a graduate student in a related field.This work has it right: https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html//2402.00861&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they solve the 2%? This is the question. If those problems were unseen, that might be already very impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094546</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the connection between procrastination and the fear of not being good enough, highlighting how this fear can lead to avoidance behaviors. It discusses the psychological factors that contribute to procrastination, such as perfectionism and self-doubt, emphasizing the importance of understanding these underlying issues to overcome procrastination.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suffered from this.The issue is the ego. Ego has a lot of ideas about itself and others. Ego has such high opinion about itself it only can do great work. Which prevents it from doing anything. It's kind of a way of avoiding failures. Because failures will break the grant ideas about himself OP has created.I accidentally went through a spiritual awakening which diluted ego. I have no problem in doing any kind of work now. Whether it's great or petty.OP needs to work on the ego. Or figure out a situation where OP has to ship things no matter what. Which is hard unless you are jobless and can't figure a way out apart from building useful things that people pay for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I struggle with this myself, especially around writing. My solution, from a coding perspective:If I had a massive new app to build, it would indeed feel overwhelming if I felt like I just had to sit down and build it. I think we get extra stuck on that with writing, as it often feels like we just need to go from an empty page to a well-reasoned and edited blog post, with a lot of ambiguous struggle in between.With programming, I start breaking it down into pieces of functionality, and smaller ones, until I have a list of concrete things I can actually get my head around and write the code for. I keep on doing those small things, build the structure around them, and eventually I have my app.I do the same with writing now. Not an outline really, but a list of concepts I want to get across, then smaller ideas. I write out a few of those, often a paragraph at a time. The structure starts to reveal itself, and soon enough I have a new blog post.I think the key here is arriving at something small enough that it doesn't feel overwhelming. New app or blog post feels like way too much in the moment, and my body and mind to everything possible to avoid it (procrastination). Writing out a paragraph, coding a function - very doable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will repeat my standard advice for writing more: lower your standards, and allow yourself (in fact force yourself) to publish things despite knowing that they could be better if you just changed a few more things...Also, write about things you've learned and projects you've built: both of those are topics where you aren't expected to provide shining new insight never seen before online: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101327</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant update to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, specifically focusing on enhancements to the "OAuth 2.1" proposal, which aims to consolidate and simplify the guidelines by integrating best practices from previous specifications. It outlines the changes being considered, such as the removal of legacy features, the introduction of new security measures, and the overall improvement of usability for developers.

First, standards you have to pay to obtain are a really, really bad thing. Second, I wish more effort would go into designing standards and implementations that aren't such an endless time sink when you need them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISO should be fined and abolished, and the money it took from taxpayers should be recuperated from the frauds that ran it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101181</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nature of time and perception in relation to cultural and scientific influences. It explores how language and concepts of time shape our understanding of it, referencing literary works and philosophical ideas. The text delves into the complexities of time as both an abstract concept and a physical reality, encouraging readers to reflect on their own experiences and interpretations of time within various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

From their 'About' page:Immaterial Incorporated (aka Cabinet) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) art and culture organization founded in 1999. By operating with the most expansive and inclusive definition of “culture” possible, one that includes both the quotidian and the extraordinary, Cabinet aims to foster curiosity about the world we have made and inhabit. We believe that curiosity is the very basis of ethics insofar as a deeper understanding of our social and material cultures encourages us both to be better custodians of the world and at the same time allows us to imagine it otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then there's the metaphorical "handle": a horse that "has a handle on him" is so well trained that one can put him in every situation just as if he had had a handle and could be picked up and set down at will...(it might be interesting to explore the relations between this notion and "handiness", or to how we say cars "handle" well)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070630</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Anatomy of Quarks" by Aleksey Shipilev delves into the internal workings and performance characteristics of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), particularly focusing on a feature known as "quarks". It explores how these quarks, which represent a lightweight, low-latency mechanism for communication between the runtime and profiling tools, can significantly enhance performance analysis and monitoring in Java applications. The article provides insights into the implementation of quarks, their benefits, and their implications for developers looking to optimize their JVM processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Physical Intelligence (PI), which involves the ability to use one's physical body to interact with and respond to the environment effectively. It emphasizes the importance of body awareness, movement patterns, and the capability to adapt physically to various situations. The piece highlights how developing Physical Intelligence can enhance overall well-being, performance in various activities, and the ability to manage stress. Additionally, it may offer insights into techniques or practices for improving one’s Physical Intelligence in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The (unspoken?) goal is to do my laundry - and all the other domestic tasks, because that’s where human satisfaction can be unleashedGive me a moment1. All economics / markers of value are about human happiness / satisfaction - we claim it’s money but it’s only given a value by humans who want it.2. As soon as people get rich enough they outsource their domestic tasks - hire a maid or a cook, or buy ready meals.3. In the western world companies over past fifty years got a free boost as women joined the labour force, and essentially companies were paying one guy the cost of a household now they pay two people the cost of household getting twice the workers for same price.4. So most households have lost 35 hours a week, and also still have same amount of domestic duties to do5. As we can’t give everyone a maid we might be able to give everyone a robot maid.6. Most innovations / technologies find their way into homes - from bricks to heating to electricity we invent it and eventually find a way to make our lives more comfortable - see the point about economics is just humans liking stuff7. I assumed that real robo maids would be a social shift - ie a different design of washing machine, people eating at other peoples houses every day, anti-dust surfaces.  But this one looks … interesting8. I know this is incredibly western middle class centric - but exactly what else are 6 billon people aiming for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For factories and closed environments, stuff is getting good fast, but for the rest of the "real world", no robot or AI is practical without human supervision. I automate physical things for a living and have thus become convinced.The first thing that robot will do is start a dryer that a toddler climbed into because it isn't that aware of the world around it.And that will be the end of general purpose domestic robots.That or knocking over candles or fucking up something else simultaneously trivial and terribly dangerous in context.I dream the same dream of a general purpose machine, but I think it may never be possible, and if it is we're a long way out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hard problem for a laundry robot is not folding the clothes, it's getting into the laundry room.Living in European city, space is a hard constraint. The cost of rent is 30€ per square meter per month in Paris.Laundry rooms are small. This robot is too wide and won't be able to go through the door of my laundry room. Ironing boards are foldable for a reason : they need to be setup every time. This robot can't do it, and also can't handle the softener bottle for the washing machine.Having 1 square meter empty table (0.5 for the table and 0.5 accessible space for the robot doing the folding) dedicated to folding is a pipe dream for most. Laundromats are there because some don't have enough space to even have a washing machine.Laundry room are a dedicated space for humidity and ventilation reason, so they have been designed on specific location on house plans probably more than 30 years ago on average, not having in mind robot accessibility, but rather be as small as functionally possible.Quite often for people not living in flats, but in houses, the laundry room is located in the basement with only stair or single step access.I don't think architect and construction accessibility norm will change fast enough, specially with bipedal robots right around the corner.The slack necessary for home robotics emergence has already been eaten multiple time due to the high cost of space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098236</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Jamcorder is a platform designed for musicians and artists to easily record, modify, and share their musical performances and collaborations. It offers tools for real-time recording, editing, and mixing, allowing users to add effects and enhance their tracks. The site emphasizes user-friendly navigation and community engagement, enabling artists to connect, collaborate, and showcase their work, while also providing resources and support for developing their musical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve automagically recorded my digital piano musings starting about 28 years ago. Initially, I used a simple C code on a Linux server using select to dump from dev MIDI to a timestamped file per session (a variation of an answering machine I had previously hacked together with a friend). Later, I used pianoteq recording on an iMac, which also detects gaps and records separate timestamped files. The experience has been very positive and helpful for improving technique and composition, so I do recommend this hardware if you dont already record everything.  One piece of advice, however: you want to let people who touch your piano know they get recorded, or ask them to wait until you turn off the recording. I tend to forget that I record everything after a while, and an unsuspecting friend might incorrectly assume that their improv does not lead to a permanent record. I had several people be surprised when they first learned about the automatic recording after the fact, and had to remove one or two files at their request (though the last time I needed to remove a file was around 1998; more recently, people didn’t seem to mind).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, looks amazing! (As someone nowhere near the target audience).Would love to see anything of the visualizer. Understand it’s beta, but curious what direction it would go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on launching, OP!This might be the first Show HN that I insta-purchased after reading your landing page.

&lt;p&gt;Chonkie is a lightweight, open-source library designed for developers to easily integrate a variety of customizable chart types into their JavaScript applications. The library focuses on simplicity and ease of use, providing options like line charts, bar charts, and pie charts with straightforward API calls. It encourages quick setup and supports data binding, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking for an efficient way to visualize data within their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it make sense for this to offer a chunking strategy that doesn't need a tokenizer at all? I love the goal to keep it small, but "tokenizers" is still a pretty huge dependency (and one that isn't currently compatible with Python 3.13).I've been hoping to find an ultra light-weight chunking library that can do things like very simple regex-based sentence/paragraph/markdown-aware chunking with minimal additional dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also check out https://github.com/D-Star-AI/dsRAG/ for a bit more involved chunking strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you so much for giving Chonkie a chance! Just to note Chonkie is still in beta mode (with v0.1.2 running) with a bunch of things planned for it. It's an initial working version, which seemed promising enough to present.I hope that you will stick with Chonkie for the journey of making the 'perfect' chunking library!Thanks again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100819</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Functionality and Features&gt; The Pi Board is an advanced automated chess system powered by a Raspberry Pi, utilizing an XY stepper motor mechanism and magnets to move chess pieces seamlessly across the board. The development process involved several key stages, including precise calibration of stepper motor coordinates, calculating the weight of each piece for accurate handling, integrating a robust chess engine, and optimizing piece-grabbing strategies and movement detection. Special attention was given to selecting the most efficient algorithm to minimize the stepper motors' power consumption.Is there a reason for the marketing speech? I'm assuming most people interested in this would rather read engineering speech, like so:&gt; The Pi Board, as the name suggests, uses a Raspberry Pi under the hood to calculate engine moves from &lt;Stockfish? Leela Zero?&gt;, and move the pieces with a series of stepper motors and magnets. We spent a significant amount of effort minimizing power consumption, including weighing the individual pieces to get more efficient grabbing and moving motions for each one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hate to be a spoil sport but if when pieces move they nudge other pieces out of the way and then those nudged pieces have to be put back by hand, then there’s still work left to be done. Same goes for capturing - the captured piece should walk itself off the board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories of Regium. A kickstarter scam 5 years ago that used realistic 3d animation videos of an automated chessboard to trick people out of their cash.chess.com happily took regium's money to advertise their scam to their audience.It eventually got kicked off kickstarter, and then kicked off some other kickstarter clones before self hosting their own kickstarter clone website. That was a wide ride. searching youtube for "regium chess board" will get a few hits.Pi board looks like a fun project that I'm sure will be refined over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101742</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The provided website presents the GenMC project, which focuses on the development of a tool called GenMC for automatic generation of software model checkers. The tool aids in the verification of concurrent programs by effectively modeling and analyzing their behavior, allowing for the detection of potential errors and ensuring reliability in software systems. GenMC is designed to handle various programming paradigms and provides features such as customizable semantics and efficient analysis methods, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in software verification and systems design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From: https://github.com/MPI-SWS/genmc/blob/master/doc/manual.mdBasic UsageA generic invocation of GenMC resembles the following:genmc [OPTIONS] -- [CFLAGS] &lt;file&gt;...Note that, in order for GenMC to be able to verify it, file needs to meet two requirements: finiteness and data-determinism. Finiteness means that all tests need to have finite traces, i.e., no infinite loops (these need to be bounded; see Section 2.3). Data-determinism means that the code under test should be data-deterministic, i.e., not perform actions like calling rand(), performing actions based on user input or the clock, etc. In other words, all non-determinism should originate either from the scheduler or the underlying (weak) memory model.As long as these requirements as satisfied, GenMC will detect safety errors, races on non-atomic variables, as well as some memory errors (e.g., double-free error). Users can provide safety specifications for their programs by using assert() statements.**I wonder how much this affects usefulness. How often is this the case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098466</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the new features and improvements introduced in F# 9, focusing on language enhancements that increase productivity and usability for developers. Key updates include support for records with updates, improved pattern matching capabilities, and new type annotations that enhance code clarity. Additionally, it discusses benefits like better interoperability with .NET, expanded support for the Discriminated Unions, and features aimed at optimizing performance. Overall, F# 9 aims to streamline workflow and improve the development experience for F# programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;F# has been my favorite language since I first encountered it in uni. 
F# was/is waaaay out ahead of C# with features like unions, null safety, pattern matching, records, more powerful type inference and generic constraints.Over the years C# has been implementing these features too, which is good, but they have been implementing them in incompatible ways, which isn't very good. Since the investment in F# has been much smaller than in C#, it hasn't been innovating as fast as C# and has been left behind in some ways.But it is still a great language and remains broadly compatible with the ecosystem and can deliver equal performance to C# with far less boiler plate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is also a new compile-time error for classes with over 65,520 methods in generated IL. Such classes aren't loadable by the CLR and result in a run-time error. (You won't author that many methods, but there have been cases with generated code.)The mind boggles.At any rate, F# is a terrific language. After excel, probably the second best thing Microsoft has ever released. Turns .NET into a reasonable platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, I made a large, multi-year company/technology bet on top of F# with Phosphor.After over a year of trying to make it work, we completely rewrote the application in Typescript and Rust. The product we're building is an end-user programming tool where the traditional lines between front-end and back-end work blur, and the .NET ecosystem really didn't lend itself well to this.Our hope was that we'd be able to use the Fable library to maintain type safety across a variety of technologies while being able to interop and in and out as needed: Fable compiles F# code to JS, Rust, .NET, etc. The reality was that the interop story between the various libraries we'd use was much harder to achieve than initially expected, and managing and updating multiple dependencies and their bindings was an absolute PITA.The assumption that F# makes for beautiful, efficient code is still a safe one, I think. But the ecosystem and the way that it was designed makes it (in my view) applicable only for applications and software that have very traditional frontend/backend lines. F# would be used for the back-end only in that case.Today, two of the technologies I'm most excited by (and which we're using internally) are the Effect library, whose Schema library fills in a lot of the gaps in TS's type system, and Moonbit, which is what I imagine a modern version of F# would like, free of the MS/.NET dependencies. Moonbit is really, really well designed (designed by the creator of OCAML's version of Fable, ReScript), and it compiles directly to highly optimized JS, WASM or Native output. We're using Effect in production, and not yet Moonbit, but the promise Moonbit holds as a language built for an AI-first world is pretty fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101312</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses typesetting engines, focusing on their role in producing high-quality documents and handling complex layouts. It explores various typesetting tools, including LaTeX, and compares features such as syntax, flexibility, and the ability to manage large documents. The piece emphasizes the importance of choosing the right typesetting engine based on specific needs, such as academic publishing or personal projects, and highlights the ongoing development and community support surrounding these tools. The discussion also touches on trends in typesetting technology and its impact on document creation.&lt;/p&gt;

Widely spoken indo-european languages includes English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and Spanish, etc.&gt; Indo-European languages typically use the Latin alphabetAfter the first sentence, "Indo-European" seems to have transformed to just "European" in the author's mind. Hindi and Bengali, languages more widely spoken than half the language in that list, seem to have been forgotten, along with their Devanagri script.(Over the course of the article, it's seeming like the author just wanted to say European languages, or languages using Latin script, and for some reason chose to use Indo-European instead, despite clearly stating the definition themself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most painful issues I encountered when building out a text layout engine for my JS 2D canvas library were:- Vertical text - in particular when it comes to how CJK punctuation differs in horizontal and vertical environments (not yet solved)- Staying on CJK, making sure the punctuation marks that follow a character don't break and remain with their preceding characters at all times. (I expect the same holds for opening quotes etc but haven't experimented).- Highly ligatured fonts - Devangari, Arabic, etc - there's no solution to styling individual characters within a word that I could find.- Talking of styling ... underlining text is a nightmare - especially if you want to get the little gap between hanging characters and the underline that HTML/CSS browsers do out of the box- Formatting Thai fonts ... is another World of Hurt[1][1] - https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/thai/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written and published over a dozen books. (Two published with big tech publishers, the rest self-published.)With my most recent book, I've moved my PDF generation to Typst.

&lt;p&gt;The Web Locks API provides a mechanism for web applications to request and manage locks for shared resources, ensuring that operations on these resources do not conflict when accessed concurrently. This API allows developers to create exclusive or shared locks to prevent race conditions and inconsistencies in data handling. The documentation covers key concepts, usage patterns, and the methods available for lock acquisition and release, as well as potential use cases and best practices for implementing the API in applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; navigator.locks.request("my_resource", async (lock) =&gt; {This would be so much more readable with `using`  {
    using lock = navigator.lock('my_resource');
    await do_something();
    await do_something_else();
  }

(https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-managemen...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the compatibility tables on MDN gave an indicator of when a feature became available.My ideal would be a thing that says "this hit 90% of deployed browsers 4 years ago", but just seeing the date it was added to each of the significant browser families would be amazingly useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why only in secure contexts? You can use storage APIs in insecure contexts, doing this by spinning, but the lock API which seems much more innocuous requires a secure context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101434</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A piece of advice I've given junior engineers is to write everything twice. Solve the problem. Stash your code onto a branch. Then write all the code again. I discovered this method by accident after the laptop containing a few days of work died. Rewriting the solution only took 25% the time as the initial implementation, and the result was much better.This is true, and I've discovered it myself by losing a branch.However, who the hell has time to write everything twice? There's 1,000 things waiting to be written once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People learn to work better by reflecting on work.  So any framework for self-observation is better than none.I suspect that algorithms as a framework demonstrates the structural aspects (e.g., how some searches are more extensive), but might hide the driving factors. Indeed, the article examples were almost all hacking personality, not technical or process solutions.E.g., most over-engineered solutions are driven by fear, often itself driven by critical or competitive environments.  Conversely, much of the power of senior/staff engineers comes from the license to cut corners afforded their experience.  Or people use the tools they know.You can't get to great by holding onto good.  It's easy to go from bad to good, but takes some courage to toss good to start over for great.  The lesson there is that we stand (hide?) behind our work, and we need to let go of it to improve it.A meta-lesson is that managers need to deeply understand personal space of each developer and the social dynamics of the team before they can do their job effectively, and a key part of that is likely checking in with developers in a way that enhances their courage and self-observation instead of making them fearful and paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review: An anonymous "distinguished CEO and engineer" suggests if you can't complete a feature in a day, delete your progress (except for tests) and start again the next day.The author then recounts advice he gives to juniors, which is to stash the work and rewrite it, claiming that the next day the work will be rewritten in 25% of the time and 2x quality. This is unsubstantiated though. For juniors this suggests it will help them develop their capabilities to reason about implementations of problems without needing to face a a large amount of them.The author then gives another advice which is to ask for a solution to a problem then after the initial proposal, ask for a 24h solution. This is meant to generate "the real solution". He likens it the a path algorithm heuristic to reach your goal quicker.Overall the methods are not well discussed in terms of pros and cons, nor substantiated with experiments.Opinion: I think they may help some juniors who need to build up experience and may become stuck in development patterns. But they would rarely be useful to develop someone to be a senior, if all they do is chase fast implementations. In a way the post gives conflicting advice: write twice and write better, and think twice and think about the fastest way to achieve the goal, instead of engineering a problem.The author hasn't really convinced me of these approaches, and especially the last one smells of eXtreme Go Horse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101729</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the principles behind the Harrison timekeeper, a groundbreaking marine chronometer created by John Harrison in the 18th century. It highlights Harrison's challenges in solving the problem of measuring longitude at sea and details his innovative designs and timekeeping mechanisms, which significantly advanced navigation technology. The piece emphasizes the importance of accuracy and reliability in understanding time, illustrating the historical context and lasting impact of Harrison's work on maritime exploration and timekeeping accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A decent, short book on the historical story behind H4 (and the rest of Mr. Harrison’s time-keepers) is “Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time” by Dava Sobel. It goes into the longitude competition, the people involved, and how Harrison was able to (eventually) win with his timekeepers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uni. prof here/shameless plug: I developed a general education class for college students about the 'history of navigation' which includes the science behind navigation and why clocks and (accurate) timekeeping are needed for navigation.  I wrote a book about it all I use for the class, if anyone's interested: https://www.amazon.com/Longitude-Time-Navigation-Tom-Bensky-.... I was inspired by Sobel's book, but I needed more math and science in the discussions.Also, if you can find the book by Williams called "From Sails to Satellites: The Origin and Development of Navigational Science" you'll laugh out loud at his wit about navigation throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also cool from the same site: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/diaphragm-piston-air-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099778</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Bjorn is a lightweight, flexible, and modern task automation tool designed to enhance developer productivity. It allows users to define and manage tasks easily, integrating seamlessly with existing tools and workflows. Key features include customizable task dependencies, support for various programming languages, and a simple syntax that simplifies task execution and automation processes. The tool aims to streamline development processes by reducing manual effort and enabling better task management within projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Also screenshots of the display look cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an absolutely stupid idea. You should never wire up service discovery tools directly to attack tools without a human doing some sanity checking.Anyone legitimately doing offensive security work knows that stupid automated scans are how you take down clients internal networks. Real testing does not involve stealing all the files you can possibly access, it means poking to see what might be useful for further exploitation and only grabbing a small sample for your report (primarily to limit your own liability).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101688</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of managing multiple projects simultaneously and the impact this has on productivity and focus. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing tasks and setting realistic timelines to avoid feeling overwhelmed. The author shares personal experiences and insights on overcoming the dilemma of juggling too many commitments, suggesting strategies for better organization and time management. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a more mindful approach to project selection and execution to enhance overall effectiveness and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I learned from running https://www.gnod.com (20 years) and https://www.productchart.com (10 years):Keep your stack flat.Most projects of my web developer friends died after months or a few years. None survived for decades. And the reason was always stack rot.Multiple parts of their stack became outdated and so hard to update that they quit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a problem for any project, and yet another reason to prefer static files for as much as your stack as possible and do not follow the latest tech-stack trends too closely. It is called the bleeding edge because it is covered in the blood of dead projects that cannot be maintained.My advice is to use as few technologies in your stack as possible. Sure, your project might work best with a relational db and a dedicated document store but it might be less ongoing effort to emulate one with the other.And freeze (or at least document) the versions of any dependencies for release. Your project runs fine with CoolTech.1.4 now but in 5 years when you come to rebuild you will find that the interface to CoolTech.6.44 is completely different.And even then things might fail. 20+ years ago I made some Java applets that were well received and useful. Technically they still work (I think) but nobody runs Java in the browser so those projects have been unusable for years. We can be smug about our pure HTML5 static sites now but who knows what the browser landscape will be like in 2050.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally agree with the thesis here.Adjacent points: I also think that selecting mature projects for your dependencies matters significantly. My old couchdb or early node work is generally defunct. On the other hand, I have some dotnet projects that are still functional with zero updates from a decade or more ago.Additionally, it's reasonable to keep a copy of your dependencies somewhere in case the vendor dies, the licensing changes, or something else catastrophic happens. Even if you just image dev's machines when they offboard. There have been a few times this has prevented permanent project death or rewrite emergencies for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101190</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The document provides an overview of the Memory64 proposal for WebAssembly, which aims to extend the addressable memory space from a maximum of 4GB to potentially 16 exabytes. This change is driven by the need for larger memory allocations to support increasingly complex applications. The proposal outlines key ideas, including a new 64-bit memory management model, backward compatibility with existing 32-bit WebAssembly applications, and potential impact on performance. Additionally, it discusses implementation considerations and the ongoing discussions surrounding security and interoperability in relation to this expanded memory model.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious to see what the performance impact of using 64bit memory ends up being. WASM runtimes currently use a clever trick on 64bit host platforms where they allocate a solid 4GB block of virtual memory up front, and then rely on the MMU to catch out-of-bounds accesses by faulting on unmapped pages, so bounds checking is effectively free. That won't work with 64bit WASM though so runtimes will have to do old fashioned explicit bounds checking on every single heap access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there movement on allowing larger memory usage for JS in browsers too? It's pretty limiting in some cases, say if you want to open a large file locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Safari: ?What an understatement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075403</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Dobble," a popular card game that emphasizes quick recognition and reflexes. Each card features various images, and players must find the one matching symbol between their cards. The game fosters cognitive skills such as focus and speed, making it an engaging way for players of all ages to enhance their observational abilities. The author highlights various playing modes and the appeal of the game for both casual and serious gamers, emphasizing its educational potential and entertainment value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Gregor MacGregor, a Scottish adventurer and con artist who created the fictional country of Poyais in the early 19th century, promoting it as a paradise in Honduras. Despite lacking any real basis or legitimacy, MacGregor produced a detailed map and enticing descriptions to attract investors and settlers. His fraudulent claims led many to invest their money or emigrate, only to find the land did not exist as advertised, resulting in significant financial loss and hardship for those deceived. The piece highlights the audacity and impact of MacGregor's elaborate scheme and its historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article details the process of creating a latency tester, focusing on measuring the time it takes for a signal to travel through a system. It provides insights into the design considerations, equipment needed, and step-by-step instructions for building a custom device. The author explains the importance of accurate latency testing in various applications and offers practical tips for ensuring reliable measurements. Overall, the piece serves as a comprehensive guide for hobbyists and professionals interested in testing and optimizing system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it looks like input latency on current hardware still has not quite caught up with the apple IIe, but is better that the PET 4016, so not all the hardware progress in the last seven yeas has been eaten by software: https://danluu.com/input-lag/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that he openly discusses the paths he went wrong and how more accuracy could be found. Detection threshold from the sensor or avoiding accidental synchronization to the monitor are not obvious pitfalls. 
The mini ASCII histogram is something I need myself - nice thought!I remain puzzled on the goal. 
Does he optimize his setup for a good coding experience? (this should definitely include the actual keyboard in the measurements!) 
Is he optimizing editors? Picking a new monitor? As a learning excercise?I'm all for "because I can" as a valid reason, but that often leaves my projects dangling halfway complete. Are we there yet? Don't know - not sure where I want to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wants to measure this latency without special hardware or code, check if your (friend's) smartphone has a 1000 fps mode. I'm not caught up with newer phones but my 2019 Samsung has this and I use it all the time to look at things that happen quickly.It just needs a lot of light (phone flashlight is sufficient at short range), or to emit light by itself like a screen (or microwave segment display, as a random example where you can see it lights up each digit individually and they're never all on at the same time, but we can't perceive that).Method:To measure, film the computer screen, positioning the phone in a way that it also captures the keyboard (best head on, since you're interested in when vertical movement stops). Press record, strike a key, and go frame by frame on the recording. The moment the key bottoms out is pretty clear by your finger stopping to move down (if the focus is good, you also see a ripple effect in your hand). I know the trigger point will be before the key's very bottom, but the whole key's travel time is on the order of 2-3 frames = ~2-3 ms, which is good enough for me. Then, count frames until the computer screen updates. I usually wait for all channels before considering it updated (my work laptop emits only red on a separate refresh cycle, sometimes noticeable if you look away with some lucky timing in the right way)Similarly for the mouse, though I usually pick it up and hold it in one hand before the screen and click the button in the air so that you can hold it in a good (for the camera) position more easily. By lifting your finger off the mouse button until the moment where you're going to press it, the separation is very well visible on camera and the moment of pressing quite exactly determinableResults:On the LUKS disk password prompt at boot, latency is about 19 ms on a laptop. It feels extremely fast, a little like it shows the asterisk before I've finished pressing the key. After booting the OS, in gnome-terminal I get 48 ms. Connecting an external screen and keyboard via a cheap USB hub, it grows to 62 ms. Finally, inside the virtual machines we're supposed to use for everything (because security), my input-to-photon latency is 134 ms. Guess I can see why that boot prompt feels like a time traveller compared to what I need to use all day long!On a different setup (a family member's iirc, running Windows) with an external monitor that has three gaming modes, called standard, fast, and faster, the latencies are 67, 67, and 62 ms. Pretty disappointing for a "low latency gaming" mode!---Compared to the submission:&gt; One source of latency users experience that my tester doesn’t measure is keyboard latency.The high speed camera method will include this, which is an advantage if you want to know how much latency your setup has, but doesn't help you in picking apart where the latency occurs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044426</guid></item><item><title>28.

It uses independent units of behavior, called bthreads, which are coordinated in a pub-sub protocol.[0] https://cacm.acm.org/research/behavioral-programming/ (2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like it could be promising for embedded and real time event handling.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite beefact™ is that each drone carries millions of identical sperm (i.e. male gametes created via mitosis); each queen only takes one maiden voyage, whereupon she typically chooses about a dozen suitors.Her spermathacea is able to keep isolated these dozen suitors' loads, and remembers both the order and the aggressiveness of each suitor (each's "rapiness"). Queen can then choose which sperm bank to use when fertilizing each egg (i.e. creating more female workers)...Through incredible (and largely unknown) mechanisms, queen typically develops sperm/suitor preference. Remembering the rapiness of each suitor, she can adjust hive's temperment (e.g. if skunks are robbing, be more aggressive).As she ages, she'll run out of "The Best Sperm" (remember: it's all stored for YEARS from one mating afternoon) and have to go to B-team, C-team, etc... until the workers choose to replace her (queen mandibular hormone output also greatly reduces as she ages, which gives the hive "identity").One day the Queen's Court will lead her to a queen cup, have her lay a fertilized egg within, ultimately sealing her fate [to be murdered by the princess queen upon her birthing, unless she is still healthy/young enough to be chosen to lead the next outgoing swarm].Source: beekeeper that has read too many books&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case you want to try honeybee experiments at home ... from the paper:https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953"Honeybee handling proceduresThe honeybees were collected from Apis mellifera carnica colonies (western honeybee) at the bee yard of the Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany. Female eggs were collected from naturally mated queens, which were maintained in small nuc colonies with five combs (Holtermann, Germany). To collect female eggs, the queens were caged in Jenter egg-collecting cages (Jenter queen rearing kit, Karl Jenter GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany). For the tracking, we collected newly eclosed bees (0 to 24 hours old) from a brood comb that was maintained in an incubator at 34°C. The laboratory rearing of worker bees was done as previously reported (19). We grafted the newly hatched larvae into plastic cups (#4963, Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) with worker diet # 7 (53% royal jelly, 4% glucose, 8% fructose, 1% yeast extract, and 34% autoclaved water) (74). To obtain bees with fully developed worker characteristics, we experimentally determined the amount of food provided, which was 170 μl per larvae. The larvae were kept at 34°C and 90% relative humidity. The latter was generated using saturated solution of K2SO4 (75). Before defecation, the larvae were transferred onto Kimwipe papers (Delicate Task Wipers, #066664, Kimberly Clark) and were kept in petri dishes for 2 days at 70% relative humidity, which we generated using saturated NaCl2 solutions (75). After defecation, the prepupae were separated into plates with 24 wells (#92424, Peter Oehmen GmBH, Essen, Germany) in which filter papers were placed (15 mm, grade 413; VWR, International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Once they started walking, they were marked and maintained in small cages together with eclosed wt workers coming from colonies (#20104; Imkereifachhandel Jasniak, Trossin, Germany) in which water and sugar paste supplemented with pollen (#7032; Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) was provided. To obtain myrGFP-mutated worker or queen bees, we reared the queens as described (17, 76). To obtain myrGFP worker bees, 12- to 19-day-old myrGFP queens were inseminated with wt drones using standard insemination techniques. The queens were treated with CO2 1 day before insemination. Inseminated queens were maintained in small nucs (“Kieler Begattungskasten,” Holtermann, Germany) with wt worker bees. The nucs were kept in a containment so that mutated animals were not able to escape into nature. To obtain newly eclosed dsxmyrGFP/+ worker bees, combs with capped cells were maintained in an incubator at 34°C."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting insight led to their research (from the paper):
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953(First, some interesting background:)"The evolutionary transition from solitary to social living in vertebrates and invertebrates led to sophisticated social behaviors. During the past 50 to 150 million years of evolution, sociality in some species became so elaborate that individuals in the group forego reproduction and changed their behavioral performance to embrace collective behavior, while others specialize in reproduction leading to the development of two castes, queen and workers (1, 2). From behavioral activities of hundreds and sometimes ten-thousands of worker individuals, new properties have emerged at the collective level such as shared brood care, warfare, collective thermoregulation, nest building, and farming, which contributed to the spectacular ecological success of the eusocial species (2). The collective tasks and functions cannot be performed by any single individual alone. They require a group and inherited behavioral patterns performed by individual workers."(And later ... [I added the paragraph breaks])"In advanced eusocial insect colonies, sophisticated innate behaviors establishing sociality are limited to the worker caste, not to queens. This led to our hypothesis that a dedicated developmental program for social behaviors will be found in the pathway determining the differentiation into the worker castes. ...Dsx proteins are part of the structurally and functionally conserved doublesex and mab-3–related transcription factor family (Dmrt) and are critical for sex-specific differentiation throughout the animal kingdom (39, 40) and sexual behaviors in insects (9, 41). DsxF is required for the worker-characteristic differentiation of the worker ovary, suggesting that DsxF is a component of the worker caste developmental program (19).The worker bees do not perform sexual behaviors. However, we found that dsx is also expressed in the worker’s brain (42) suggesting that the gene may have another role unrelated to sexual reproduction but related to promoting social living behaviors in the worker caste."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055134</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This comment is not legal advice.  This comment is merely for educational purposes.The quote that you have about the 1997 patent, namely "U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,925 teaches a process for adjusting the deposition rate..." is from the specification.  That is written by either the inventors or more likely the attorneys filing the application.  The specification is not legally enforceable or binding.  It is supposed to disclose enough information to let somebody reproduce the claimed invention.  As a matter of practice, the specification can say almost anything it wants, including non-enforceable things.Only the claims are legally enforceable.  I suggest taking a closer look at the claims and seeing if these are problematic for your application or not.  You may want to consult an attorney if you have further questions.You can look up the patent examiner's reasoning for allowing the application here:https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17667081Click on "Documents and Transactions" and look for "Notice of Allowance and Fees Due".  Also look for the "Non-Final Rejection" for additional information from the examiner from an earlier version of the application.I should note that it does not appear that the patent examiner considered the 1997 patent directly relevant because they did not cite it in any of the office actions or specifically the PTO-892 forms (search the documents page for 892 to see what I'm talking about).  However, they likely did at least look at it since it is listed in the specification.Again, if you have further questions, you really should consult an attorney.  This is not a good forum for this kind of discussion, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant video on the subject, discussing brick layers, and the patents:https://youtu.be/9IdNA_hWiyE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real problem is that patent system seems ripe for abuse.  Even if the "invention" is not a valid patent, companies want to patent it anyway, as to force the other side to expend resources to prove it's not valid.There's a couple Bambu Lab patents that probably should not have been granted with prior art in open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102235</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a fun paper, but very difficult to draw conclusions from. Their headline finding is that they created a map between resting state and "watching a movie".This is, for better or worse, the kind of research you can only do at institutions which have free fMRI scanning (MIT, Princeton, Harvard, etc.). No behavioural links, only very detailed activation maps that we can't really draw conclusions from. A missed opportunity IMO to spend these kinds of scanning resource on some kind of more narrowly focussed task with some behavioural outcome they can link to brain data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100645</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how DNA analysis of victims from the Pompeii eruption has uncovered unexpected familial and social relationships among the deceased, highlighting the complexity of their connections. While the disaster was catastrophic, the genetic data has provided insights into the individuals' origins and ties, revealing that many of the victims were not just random inhabitants but were likely linked through shared ancestry or familial bonds. This research expands our understanding of the population dynamics of Pompeii and the human stories behind the tragic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website offers an interactive time-travel experience using Google Street View, allowing users to explore historical images of various locations around the world. By selecting different dates, users can see how specific places have changed over time, providing a visual journey through history. This feature highlights significant changes in urban landscapes, architecture, and environments while engaging users in a unique way to learn about the past.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks less like a street view, and more like 360 images that link to one another. For example with future LA, I could only jump once forward and then back and the images didn't have any continuity between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the title should be "AI time-travel street-view" if it's going to have hyphens anywhere,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool but the interface could use some tweaks to be useable, or at least more consistent with actual Google Street view.  - transitions do not animate between camera positions
  - positions are spaced so far apart that it's not clear how they are connected.  Google Street View normally has many positions close together, so you always have a sense of where you are relative to your last position.
  - acceleration for spinning the viewpoint is too high, I kept overshooting my target and having to go back and forth, dropping down to a slower speed for accuracy.
  - the icons disappear when you click, which no explanation to get them back.  I didn't even realize they were off at first and just thought there weren't many icons
  - the "info" icon enlarges on hover, suggesting it's interactive if you click on it, but nothing happens
  - arrows on the ground would be nice

Some of these are a bit nit-picky, but if you're going to call it "Street View", then you set certain expectations.  If you're going for a different experience, it should be called something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075855</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came into a company once that had built their own server room.  It had a couple hundred pizza boxes in it and was always hot as hell even with full blast air conditioning.  When I retired almost all of them to use virtual servers, it turns out that 1) a lot of the chipsets internallyl still had plastic film on them (to prevent scratches? Why would you put film on them? There were even some CPUs that didn't have any coolers on them, just film) and 2) A lot of the inpflow and outflow air ports also had plastic shipping film that was never removed.  I was completely shocked.  So I fixed dozens if not a hundred computers simply by removing a piece of tape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My 1070 is currently running with tape covering half of the PCIe pins so it works on x8 instead of x16.One day it stopped working. During troubleshooting it would work only on a 10 year old PC I had lying around. The difference? Despite being full-size, the GPU slot on the old mobo was wired only for x8.I reckon that the GPU die lost connection on some pins. Not worth fixing, x8 works fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently on a mission to tape a bunch of gear too. Though to cover LEDs. Why does consumer gear meant for houses look like a disco at night?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103000</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses implementing pushed authorization requests (PAR) in ASP.NET Core 9, focusing on how this approach enhances security during the authorization process by allowing clients to send a request for authorization in advance without requiring user interaction. It outlines the necessary steps for configuring PAR in an ASP.NET application, including setting up the required services, defining endpoints, and handling authorization logic. The piece also highlights the benefits of using PAR, such as improved user experience and reduced risk of authorization code interception, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to implement more secure OAuth 2.0 flows in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to effectively handle the salary expectations question during job interviews. It emphasizes the importance of researching industry standards and understanding your worth before the interview. The author suggests strategies for responding, such as deflecting the question initially or providing a salary range based on market data. Additionally, the piece highlights the significance of confidence and preparation in negotiating salary to achieve favorable outcomes in job offers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always recommend this article: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
I think this topic is super important and I’m really glad I didn’t follow advice of saying your “expected salary or expected +20%”. Here my anecdotal SWE salary history:Worked at a startup for a bunch of years making 90k by the endGot offered a place at FAANG. Recruiter pushed me a little bit on expected salary but I didn’t give one using all the approached from the linked article. They offered me 250k. I would have never ever assumed that I can be payed this much. 
Instead of accepting I again followed the advice and asked for time to think. I had no counter offers but spoke to the recruiter thanked them for the offer and asked if there’s room for improvement. And they were nice and reasonable, they said yes if there are counter offers or you are leaving unvested stock behind. I was leaving unvested stock in an unprofitable startup, but I wrote the amount and vesting schedule and got offer bumped by 25k.After working there I considered going to trading shop. Used the same approach and they offered 400k. Again this number seemed insane at the time. So I asked for more, this time I had much lower counter offer. But I could use it as some form of leverage. They upped the offer by 150k by the end (this is sign on+ salary+guaranteed first year bonus).I am writing this not to show off the numbers, but to show other engineers that your idea of how much you should be payed could be completely wrong. Let the employer give information first and don’t back yourself into the corner by revealing your ignorance of market or minimum comp you are willing to take.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've talked to several recruiters and HR people who were prepared for quite a different answer than I gave to this question.I got the feeling that several interviews were carried out afterwards out of politeness or because the recruiter "had to" do it, but the interview ended before it began. Than, there's either ghosting or almost immediate (like up to an hour past the interview) copy-paste email along the lines of "we decided to go with another candidate".A few recruiters however were open that they've checked the salary for similar position in my country's capital city (Warsaw) and it's much lower than what I'm asking. Pointing out 20+ years of experience and listing accomplishments seems less important for a lot of businesses, than paying as little as possible.I got a few links to these "check salary for [level] [position] in [city]" websites from recruiters. All these seem to be crafted in a way that undervalues employees by artificially lowering country-wide salaries to ridiculous levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless you end up with someone like me who has a budget and always pays the max.I usually ask "what do you expect to be paid" to understand if I'll make them happy or sad when discussing what I'll actually offer.This is not foolproof and has caused some issues with people coming in as very good negotiators and thinking my inability to budge is because I'm being hard-line, when in reality it's because- as mentioned, I always offered the max for a role.The second issue is that not all people are equivalently valuable, but I think solving that in the salary is terrible, because salary should cover your compensation for responsibility. If you have to reward someone valuable then it should probably be via bonus' imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101107</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the urgent need for effective conservation strategies to protect biodiversity amid rapid environmental changes. It emphasizes the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge with modern scientific approaches to create holistic and adaptive management plans. The authors advocate for collaborative efforts among various stakeholders, including local communities, policymakers, and scientists, highlighting case studies that illustrate successful conservation practices. The study ultimately calls for a more inclusive and dynamic framework to enhance conservation outcomes in diverse ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Rats have low training and maintenance costs, flexibly work with multiple handlers, have a long lifespan, and a sophisticated sense of smell. Their small size also offers unique capabilities for the screening of shipping containers, such as being able to navigate densely packed areas or be lifted to assess contents of sealed containers by screening ventilation systems. Future directions include assessing operational feasibility of deploying rats at ports.A fascinating read.  A team of  2 rats were able to get a 100% detection rate with very few false positives. Would be a transformative change for import customs if it translates to real-world settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026468</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses updates to the Rust programming language's trademark policy, which aims to clarify the use of the Rust logo, name, and branding by individuals and organizations. The updates emphasize a more flexible approach to using the trademark in community projects while maintaining the integrity of the Rust brand. It also outlines the process for obtaining permission to use the trademarks, ensuring that Rust remains a recognizable and trusted technology while fostering community involvement and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part of the policy about distributing modified versions of the Rust compiler seems interesting:&gt; Publicly distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language, compiler,
or the Cargo package manager, provided that the modifications are limited to:&gt; - code adjustments for the purpose of porting to a different platform, architecture,
or system, or integrating the software with the packaging system of that platformIt looks like distributing a modified version with any change that isn't related to compatibility with a different platform/architecture/system is not allowed. This would probably make almost all GitHub forks of Rust non-compliant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This subject is a touchy one because it usually attracts a lot of people who are upset because they think they’ve lost something they had. A lot of those comments start with “I’m not a lawyer but …”Then all of these upset people writing angry comments creates an impression of drama.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), confirming that they have achieved significant milestones in natural language understanding and generation. It highlights the capabilities of these models to perform complex tasks, engage in coherent dialogues, and generate contextually relevant responses. The piece also reflects on the implications of these developments for the future of artificial intelligence, addressing both the potential benefits and ethical considerations that arise from increasingly powerful LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who followed Deep Learning in the 2010s would have guessed the same thing. Big boom with vision models by adding a lot of layers and data, but eventually there was diminishing returns there too. It’s unsurprising the same would happen with LLMs. I don’t know why people keep expecting anything other than a sigmoid curve. Perhaps they think it’s like Moore’s law but that’s simply not the case in this field.But that’s fine, LLMs as-is are amazing without being AGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- There _was_ a problem with diminishing returns from increasing data size. Then they surpassed that by curating data.- Then the limits on the amount of curatable data available made the performance gains level off. So they started generating data and that pushed the nose up again.- Eventually, even with generated data, gains flattened out. So they started increasing inference time. They have now proven that this improves the performance quite a bit.It's always been a series of S-curves and we have always (sooner or later) innovated to the next level.Marcus has always been a mouth just trying to take down neural networks.Someday we will move on from LLMs, large multimodal models, transformers, maybe even neural networks, in order to add new levels and types of intelligence.But Marcus's mouth will never stop yapping about how it won't work.I think we are now at the point where we can literally build a digital twin video avatar to handily win a debate with Marcus, and he will continue to deny that any of it really works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The context some commenters here seem to be missing is that Marcus is arguing that spending another $100B on pure scaling (more params, more data, more compute) is unlikely to repeat the qualitatively massive improvement we saw between say 2017 and 2022. We see some evidence this is true in the shift towards what I categorize as system integration approaches: RAG, step by step reasoning, function calling, "agents", etc. The theory and engineering is getting steadily better as evidenced by the rapidly improving capability of models down in the 1-10B param range but we don't see the same radical improvements out of ChatGPT etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097774</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember setting geofenced reminders maybe even 10 years ago ("remind me X when I'm near the supermarket") and they were pretty cool but sat squarely in that zone where they were useful enough to be interesting but not reliable enough that you could count on them (the number of times I got a reminder 5 minutes after I left a place was a lot) - so the applications where you could seriously use them sat in a very narrow band.This is probably one of a litany of missed opportunities I see where specifically Google missed the boat around 2010 - 2015. So much of what we have today they were already rolling out on phones as smart features ("Google Now" etc), and somehow it all faltered or even went backwards (I could reliably in set reminders by voice in 2013 I think, but by 2018 they were so unreliable I gave up).What I don't understand here is how they are going to do all this tracking and ambient AI without destroying your phone battery. I'm surprised Apple especially will even allow a background process to run that is doing that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gross.&gt; “The new company is building a service that leverages the enormous corpus of data in large AI systems and  newly ubiquitous headphones. Then it’s adding the capabilities of a smartphone to surface relevant local information as and when a person walks by a location, such as a restaurant, a cocktail bar, or even a street corner.”&gt; “He talks about attempting to make sense of it all while staying true to his original mission: building things that help people better experience the world around them.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not exactly certain if I want my headphones interrupting my train of thought as I walk down the street.  But I would actually like asking a question and getting an answer.  An AI that understood my preferences and my current location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097086</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Linux Asceticism explores the philosophy of minimalist computing and emphasizes the importance of simplicity, efficiency, and control in using Linux. It discusses the benefits of adopting a disciplined approach to software and system management, advocating for the reduction of unnecessary tools and distractions. The author encourages users to focus on mastering essential skills and tools, promoting a more profound understanding of their systems and fostering productivity through minimalism. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for users seeking to enhance their Linux experience by prioritizing simplicity and intentionality in their computing practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s funny, I feel quite the opposite. Using windows is a form of asceticism, and Linux is the easy way. Everything just works under Linux, but under Windows, things go wrong for no apparent reason, the system installs updates and reboots without me telling it to, there is massive network traffic that I didn’t initiate, none of my tools work properly, there are ads on the start menu, and software I know I installed is nowhere to be found. Talk about mortification of the flesh! Nothing humbles you like being subject to Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get it, for me a computer is a tool. I want to get away from it as fast as possible, having to tweak the environment is a waste of time .That's why I like macos so much, nothing is perfect but I know that whatever I do there are tools somewhat easy to use .For instance I wanted to read an epub on my computer that runs windows, believe it or not but finding a good or even descent epub reader is a nightmare. Wasted a lot of time before settling on FB reader.On mac, you just have the book app. It's not perfect, when you export highlights for instance it always add 'copyright blabla' but it's good enough for my casual reading.Same for pdf, you want an app that can read pdf and do some basic stuff like reorganize pages or compress them. On Mac there is preview, on windows ? Edge can just read and it's a browser, adobe is paid software and install a lot of junk.And you repeat that for basically everything it's such a waste of time.Linux is even worst than windows on that matter.If you are looking for that kind of 'experience' like the author, i suggest hitting yourself on the balls with a hammer. That would be quicker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was unsurprised to find Arch and NixOS mentioned, they're more or less for asceticism, and they usually show up on the ascetic's path. But having learned the power of going without from Linux, there's a lot of similar places to go besides an increasing difficult progression of Linux distributions.Repeatable Builds is something that can be practiced without Linux, but which the Linux ascetic will find pleasingly austere. Working with immutable data send like another. And then there's all the ways one can avoid using a pointing device, or not buying things your can't hack...It's a path that Linux can teach you to to walk, but it's not Linux's path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099398</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various text file formats, specifically focusing on ASCII delimited text as a more suitable alternative to traditional CSV or tab-delimited formats. It highlights the limitations of these common formats, such as issues with encoding and special characters, and advocates for the use of ASCII, which provides better control over data representation. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing the right format for data integrity and accessibility, and provides insights on how to implement ASCII delimited text effectively in data handling practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with no restrictions on the text in fields or the need to try and escape characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but wouldn't it still need escaping for those ASCII separator characters (or alternatively, a restriction for the stored text not to have them)?It's true that having to deal with escaping much less often (since the ASCII separator characters are rarer than commas/quotes) would be convenient for manual reading/writing, but I feel that's canceled out by the characters being hard to type/see (likely the reason why they're rare) - and it wouldn't necessarily save on writer/parser code complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this format best of all, CSV is # 2 favorite.At work we settled on using ^G (0x07) as a delimiter instead of TABs for file transfers and loading data into various databases.The reason was Excel.  People/systems who create these files sometimes source from Excel.  And Excel can have a habit of placing odd characters in text fields.  We found the one character never encountered was BEL.For text fields we tend to remove embedded white space and after replacing TABs with 1 space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the early 2000s, back at the beginning of the world, Yahoo's web code used ^A and ^B for field and record separators to avoid having to escape commas and quotes and newlines. That was probably the last time I ever saw ASCII control characters used as intended in the wild.There is no technical reason why CSV should have won out, except that keyboards have a comma key and almost never a ^A key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100499</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel your pain. I have been making things like this in Go;https://github.com/tluyben/go-proxyhttps://github.com/tluyben/redis-sentinel-proxyjust to make them easier to instrument for my experiments. The first one I made because after trying all tutorials on haproxy/nginx to make proxying work without the target domain being resolvable (so no dns entry until it's up), I got annoyed (nothing worked while everything only and gpt said it should work) and just did it like this. Also it makes it very easy to throw in my own, complex as I want rules and logging and telemetry (to whatever I want) at any level.The second I needed to test an existing, not able to change (they have an old version running they cannot update at the moment, don't ask) software against a redis sentinel setup.The main thing is that I am more and going towards having the program language as config instead of greenspun's tenth rule where everyone builds some annoying and limited 'almost (usually esoteric) programming language' as config language over time. I want that hard lifting to be done in my native language (Lisp, Go, Rust) and have the config be for ip addresses and ports only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would expect my web application framework to handle all of these tasks, except perhaps header filtering. If it didn’t I’d rather fix that problem in the web application itself instead of adding a complicating layer of infrastructure that I now need to include in integration tests and release process.I see some merit to moving the size limits etc out of the application to reduce CPU waste there on overly large requests, but either way I’m still burning some CPUs on it.Is the use-case for this mostly about sticking some validation in front of a system who’s code you can’t or don’t want to modify for some reason, like in front of Wordpress?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Won't the fact that it's written in Python make it too slow for high traffic sites or APIs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097735</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Lambda 0, a concept in functional programming where a function can be treated as a first-class citizen without any context or parameters. It explores how this concept relates to the notion of pure functions and the implications for programming languages and paradigms. The author provides examples and explanations of how Lambda 0 can enhance code simplicity, maintainability, and readability, making a case for its utility in modern software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice way to think about eta-reduction is that it asserts something about the types of expressions in lambda calculus, namely that every expression is in fact a function.If an expression M can appear in the left position of the function application operation, this implies that M is a function.By way of analogy, if I have a formula x == x+0, this implies that x is a number.Or, s == s + '' would imply that s is a string.So, if M == lambda x. M(x), this is saying that M is a function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What follows the lambda is the list of arguments.It would be clearer to say that what follows the lambda is the name of its (single) argument, not a list. And then explain that for notational convenience, you could abbreviate successive abstractions. Btw, if you really base it on lists, then do you allow an empty list as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100107</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed guide on how to send an Ethernet packet using Python and sockets. It explains the necessary libraries, such as Scapy, and outlines the process of constructing and sending packets over a network. Key topics include the creation of raw sockets, setting the required socket options, and manipulating packet data to ensure proper transmission. The guide serves as a practical resource for developers looking to understand low-level network programming and packet manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But if I had any kind of point, it would probably be that spending the time to do things like write tools and explore the debugging space is pretty much always worth it.&gt; Strangely, I've found that there is a not-insignificant number of people are against this - especially in a professional environment. I think this has something to do with the JIRA-fication of development process, where all work is divided and sub-divided, and anything that does not directly check a box and produce a deliverable is wasted effort. It's disheartening that there is a whole group of people - developers and managers alike - who do not understand or see the value in exploration as part of the process.So true, being able to create your own small tools is a superpower which is often at the heart of 10x programmers. It is sadly an art often practiced in the shadow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the title is rather vague, this is the start of a series about building a TCP/IP and Ethernet framing stack from scratch for a microcontroller. The author uses a chip (W5100) which can handle TCP/IP itself, but also supports handing it pre-built Ethernet frames, although the chip handles the preamble and CRC calculation. Most of the article is about trying to communicate with the chip itself, and sending a test packet (which I'm guessing is hardcoded, although it's not called out in the article).(I was hoping it would be about bit-banging Ethernet on some improbable bit of hardware.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a strange career jump recently into FPGA engineering with a focus on Ethernet. It's been a fun journey, which culminated in me finally designing my own Hard MAC IP and sending a packet over some custom PHY IP. I'd highly recommend it for those looking to try a "Hard Mode" version of this challenge. I feel like networking is very abstracted from users, so understanding how Ethernet cards, modems and switches put together and pull apart sections of packets, and how the PHY/PCS recovers signals over a link was really valuable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105190</guid></item><item><title>2.

We did it by rooting an iPhone and using Charles Proxy to grab the unencrypted traffic.I learned a lot from that experience, and it's also just plain fun to do. We did get some strongly worded letters from Robinhood though, lol. They tried blocking our servers but we just set up this automated system in Digital Ocean that would spin up a new droplet each time we detected a blockage, and they were never able to stop us after that.Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is how I made a better version of the nhl.com site [1] that has a better UI (you can see scores/schedules much more easily), is mobile first, has no ads, and responsiveness built in.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the hypothesis postulates that previously a species different from ours had achieved high intelligence and technological civilization on this planetAn interesting special version of this hypothesis is that if a species has achieved truly high intelligence and advanced technology, it may by design not have left any traces. Not because of modesty but because long-term sustainable existence actually required being light on environmental impact.Changing your environment at planetary scale and breakneck speed is not necessarily the pinnacle of intelligence, certainly not if you have manifestly not yet understood all its intricacies, interdependence etc. A lack of understanding coupled with aggressive random interventions may even affect the very survival of a species.The downside of the deep-sea tree-huger cephalopod scenario is that it is even harder to falsify...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised the article didn't mention the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) [0] and it's interesting relation to "a species different from ours had achieved high intelligence and technological civilization on this planet."For those unaware, the PETM was a rapid increasing in global temperature (and CO2 concentrations) around between 60-50 million years ago. This lead to a minor (on a geological time scale, major for those creatures living through it) climate crisis.The cause for the rapid increase in temperatures at this time is still the subject of deep debate and largely unknown. However how very "out there" hypothesis, not even mentioned on the wikipedia page, is that this could have been when a civilization such as our experience an event more-or-less identical to our own current climate crisis caused by the rapid use of hydro-carbons.Of course, the biggest challenge with this hypothesis is, as pointed out in the article, a civilization like this would not leave a trace on the geological record. So there's really no reasonable way to have much evidence in favor of this possible explanation.But since here about this I've been fascinated by the problem of sending messages to the future. Suppose we come to realize that rapid use of hydrocarbons does most certainly lead to the destruction of any civilization foolish enough to tread this path. The most reasonable focus of scientific effort that would be to figure a way to warn the next advanced civilization on this planet in hopes they might not meet the same fate. But presuming that civilization is 50 million years in the future, how could this be done?0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Therm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The proposition that this was the case, is what I consider the actual most interesting hypothesis most likely to be false&gt;Probably the esteemed reader has noticed by now that I am no true believer in the Silurian hypothesis, but I like to entertain itThis kind of speculation has always stimulated my imagination. Unfortunately, the era of "fact-check" and truthiness has spawned a class of professional debunkers. This creates space for opportunist trolls to take the contrarian position. At one point there were those who engaged in debates over flat-earth for the sake of honing rhetorical skills. Today adults crusade against these absurdities without the slightest inkling of self-irony. Flat-earth is typically used as a pejorative at HN.We haven't entirely lost the ability to have stimulating conversations about Silurians, Atlanteans or other improbable fantasy scenarios, but the trend is approaching. It feels like an indictment of the pop-materialist world view, mass media control structures or just our current era of Internet. Perhaps other posters can point to the underlying causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106700</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/MN9bp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Even if they succeeded, the obvious question is, what would you do with it?” said Stuart Pimm, a professor at the conservation ecology research unit at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. “If you had a Woolly mammoth, you would put it in a cage. It’s a colossal exercise in ego.”This is my thought about all these efforts. The mammoth people talk like it's about a solution to climate change, but that's obviously working backwards from their goal (revive the mammoth for reasons) to some sort of reasonable-sounding justification. They set out with different motivations in mind.I'd ask the same question here: why try to bring back a species we already killed off? These won't be descendants of the animals we killed, so it's hardly a form of reparations. If it's about preserving the ecosystems we already have, there have to be more efficient ways to do that than rebreeding less stripe zebras.It's hard not to see this as just the same impulse that led to the poodle: because we can and because it will look cool and draw attention and make money. The only difference is there's a slight nostalgic bent to the aesthetic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question of 'Why bring back extinct species?' is fundamentally the same as 'Why save species from extinction?'. It's unspoken but seems to be widely understood that biodiversity and preventing its permanent loss has inherent value. It sometimes has economic or ecological value too, or the potential in the future, but even when that's not the case most would agree we should aim to minimize extinction of other animals - if for no other reason than it being easier to drive a species to extinction than revive any of the billions of extinct species out there. (at least for now)It's curious that the response to bringing back mammoths and less-stripey-zebras is so lukewarm when there's very little of the same criticism directed at efforts to save obscure species that are in decline. Say it was discovered that a small herd of quagga had survived since we thought they died out in 1883, but without human intervention they will soon due to habitat loss. Imagine: "Why would we want to save them? The world is inhospitable to them now, their population declined for a reason. They have no use to us, and their niche isn't one that couldn't be filled by living species that we could import. To keep them from going extinct would be a cruel and irrational act of ego."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107534</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've got patches under review: https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/cover.1722193092.git... (triggered by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-42410, a graphics stack stability issue that wasn't as visible in RHEL 9 for some reason)At least the first one (the getenv thread safety fix) will hopefully make it into glibc 2.41 and it should be quite safe to backport.  It turns out that setenv is easier to handle because glibc already never frees environment strings.  It's concurrent unsetenv that is rather tricky.  Without some snapshot approach, getenv would return null pointers instead of environment variables values that are actually set.  I don't want to introduce locking into getenv because getenv without setenv has been async-signal-safe for so long that it would likely break applications.The environ handling fixes are a bit more controversial because vfork+execve make it complicated to avoid memory leaks, but these further fixes are less important to the stability of the graphics stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you! I deeply appreciate that Steam works so well on Linux these days. I don't take for granted the hard work happening behind the scenes to make that a reality for us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn’t best practice to read all environment variables on boot and never use setenv? The only place where setenv would matter is for spawning new processes where you should probably be creating an new environ cloned from the current one and update the new values. Using getenv/setenv as an IPC messaging mechanism seems to be an opportunity for lots of issues aside from it historically not being multithreaded-safe on Linux and having all sorts of potential memory leaks hiding (which is what the post ignores when it says that it’s thread safe on MacOS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110677</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how ChordCat, a tool designed for musicians, works by leveraging various algorithms and techniques to provide real-time chord detection for audio input. It discusses the underlying technology, including audio processing and machine learning methods that help identify chords from music tracks. Additionally, it highlights the user experience and functionality, showcasing how ChordCat aids musicians in improving their skills and understanding of music theory. The article serves as an informative resource for those interested in music technology and chord recognition applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think that this algorithm can handle slash chords like G/C (G over C) and would instead label it as Gsus4. The former gives a lot of important context to voicing which can by important if you need a particular sort of motion in the bass line.My hunch is that any algorithm  that analyzes chords in isolation (and not in the context of other chords in the song) is going to miss out on overall readability. Good chord notation has a sort of elegance that can highlight the similarities/differences between sequential chords that can make things very intuitive for the musician&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It is also important to know that chords are built on thirds."Except for the ones built on seconds ("cluster chords"), fourths ("quartal chords"), fifths ("quintal chords"), the chords that make jazz work, and for obsessive/completists, polychords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a programmer and a classically trained pianist, this section:&gt; For example, the notes C, E and G (The C major chord) can have any of the following names, based on what is considered to be the root note.&gt; root note chord name&gt; C C Major&gt; E E Minor #5&gt; G G sus4 (13)&gt; (To the best of my knowledge, I'm no music theorist)is disqualifying for any usefulness in this program-- it will lead to more misguidance than clarity. without theory, there is no reason.i would analyze these inversion chords in the frame of the key of C major: CM, C6, and C64 based on Figured Base Notation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)#Figured_bass&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106548</guid></item><item><title>8.

Basic books teach you the how, good books teach you the why, but the great books -- and Brian wrote some truly great ones -- teach you wisdom.I read "Unix: A History and a Memoir", and it's a great book if you are into computer history, but it left me very sad. I don't know why, is it because Unix (in its philosophy) is dead? Is it because the people who help create and shape Unix are old and dying? I don't know. It's a great book but it left a void in my heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108077</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation of a trading game using the Game Boy platform, focusing on implementing a simplified stock market simulation. It details the technical aspects of the project, including the use of QuestDB for managing high-frequency trading data and the challenges faced in adapting a complex trading environment to the limitations of retro hardware. The author shares insights on programming tactics, data handling, and the overall experience of merging gaming with financial concepts, ultimately illustrating a unique blend of nostalgia and modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. Thanks for reading this post. I had fun making this and thought the path that led me to this might be interesting for others.I’m really interested in feedback and ideas on things I could improve and add. I found this really inspiring as it got me more into programming, discovering electronics, and 3d printing.I have no desire to ever make this project commercial, but it’s been a great platform for me to learn and experiment new things so I’ll take any idea be it for the gameplay or purely technical. Some features I have in mind are:- Multiplayer over bluetooth where one device is the ‘game-master’ running the exchange and can monitor and guide players while injecting events.- Additional quoting algos such as pegging one side of the order book and fighting for position- A tutorial and better UI. The game is hard to pick up for the first time and probably needs to be made more intuitive etc.While all of this was made with no practical use in mind (there are a lot of markets and products, and you’d trade them in different ways, so you’d need a different game to speak to a volatility trader for example), some people I work with at various trading desks found it useful for interviews or as an introduction to the idea of market-making for junior people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting project! The kid is only mentioned at the beginning, I wonder if they participated further in the project, or if they enjoyed playing the game?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm. Very cool project…But the last thing I want for my kid is for them to learn that active trading is fun, lest they try doing it with real money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108907</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses testing the Z80 microprocessor using a vintage 1970s computer system, specifically detailing the author's hands-on experience with rebuilding and interfacing the chip with the old hardware. It covers the challenges encountered during the testing process, such as ensuring compatibility and functionality, while also exploring the historical significance of the Z80 chip in computing. The author provides insights into the technical aspects of working with the chip, alongside reflections on the nostalgia and learning associated with retro computing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked at Fairchild Sentry DTS in San Jose (at that time very close to the airport) circa 1984-1986 on the series 50 ATE. It was a beast. At the time it could clock &amp; test up to 50MHz (hence the '50'). It was pretty much all ECL which would get very hot. Each unit shipped with a DEC VAX - that was my intro to VMS which had some interesting features like file versioning. I worked as a tech on the production floor building the 50. It was just being introduced and there were so many problems with getting them up and running. The systems had to be calibrated and that was done by changing the lengths of hundreds of delay wires on the backplane (in addition to digital delay-lines in the test head that could be automatically calibrated (over several hours) with the delay values being stored on disk). No two systems were exactly the same because of this (I'm sure this was also an issue with earlier ATE models as well). IIRC the 50 was "introduced" (announced) in '84 shortly before the time I started. I recall that we were way behind in producing them and there was lots of blame flying between production (us) and engineering - as in maybe they designed something that wasn't easily reproducible.In my next job I moved into an engineering role and I always kept that experience as a technician in the back of my mind: make sure what you're designing can be built with reproducible results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We had to be careful about those AC utility jacks. The tester ground was at -11 volts at several hundred amps. If you clipped a scope to a ground, it would happily melt the insulation off the scope probe until it stunk up the room and pooled on the floor. We had to use a three-prong adapter with the ground cut off.You don't get this kind of excitement anymore with modern electronics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typo?  "ZIP DIP socket" should be "ZIF DIP socket", as in Zero Insertion Force?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110081</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the infamous theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911, which significantly increased the painting's fame. The perpetrator, an Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia, believed that the artwork should be returned to Italy. His elaborate heist involved hiding the painting in his apartment for over two years before he attempted to sell it to an art dealer in Florence, leading to his arrest. This high-profile crime captured public attention, transforming the Mona Lisa into a global icon. The article also delves into the painting's history, its artistic significance, and how the theft altered its perception in the art world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always loved this quote: "What audacious criminal, what mystifier, what maniac collector, what insane lover, has committed this abduction?"Though Peruggia claims he did it out of patriotism, I've always nursed the theory that, during its absence, the original was used as reference to create several extremely good fake versions. These could be sold as the original, since everyone knew it had been stolen, and each would think they had the real one. Then the original is returned, and the buyers are without recourse. What are you going to do, tell the police? And of course Peruggia et al would say nothing.I suspect this isn't true, but the fun part is that it could be and no one would ever know. So I'm choosing to believe it is so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Peruggia, meanwhile, was charged with theft and put on trial in Italy. During his testimony, he claimed that national pride had inspired him to steal the painting, which he believed had been looted from his native Italy during the Napoleonic era. Peruggia was mistaken—Da Vinci had brought the Mona Lisa to France in 1516, and King Francois I had later purchased it legally—but the patriotic defense won him legions of admirers. Even after the prosecution presented evidence that he planned to shop the painting around to art dealers and sell it for profit, many Italians still considered him a national hero.Just the sort of nationalism that would lead Europe (and other nations) into the Great War only a few years later. The guy only served seven months. Nationalism begets poor outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK, this is a horrific tangent, but if you haven't seen the classic Doctor Who story "City of Death", go check it out.Written by Douglas Adams and filmed on-location in Paris, it involves the Mona Lisa being stolen, and is probably the finest Doctor Who story ever written.In fact it's so good that I'm always a little disappointed by other classic stories in comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42048162</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty sensationalist title for used furniture arbitrage.I was hoping for some insight on capture and disposition of IP.I would think failing gracefully involves reaching out to competitors (and customers and suppliers) for "mergers" so investors get some of the value of the company -- without somehow signaling that you're giving up (and can no longer be relied upon).  What's the state of the art in that respect?  It seems like a fantastically tricky process, which would mean high value for skilled practitioners.(OTW (ahem) valuable employee stock goes to zero.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2001 (or 02?) I remember visiting a clearance warehouse like this in Ottawa during the post-dot-com-boom crash and it was where all the west-end startups and network tech companies had dumped their furniture after either going completely out of business or emergency-downsizing.It was wild, I have a picture somewhere of a high-school-gym-sized room just filled corner-to-corner with plastic-wrapped Aeron chairs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regularly attended the liquidations in Sunnyvale around 2002-2005 after I was laid off from my dot com but the only thing I could make any profit on was docking stations and the associated power adapters since at that time they were specific to each laptop model. I would think the overhead storing furniture is significant. A couple of times I got lucky such as when Casady and Greene closed down and I got a bunch of copies of Conflict Catcher 9 that was still in demand and when Apple closed down a TV studio in Cupertino and I bought the contents of the back storage room that had a bunch of valuable bits and pieces. Unfortunately reality TV was still in its infancy or I would have been a minor star:-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107870</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the global health initiative "End TB," which aims to eradicate tuberculosis (TB) by raising awareness, improving prevention and treatment strategies, and addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to the disease's persistence. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration between governments, healthcare providers, and communities to achieve this goal, along with the need for increased funding and research into new technologies and therapies to combat TB effectively. The initiative highlights the urgency of acting now to prevent millions of deaths and reduce the burden of this infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This lecture from John Green is a great full summary on the history of TB
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D-gxaie6UIHe's also publishing a book about it
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/312472/everything-i...Recently, John Green lobbied to get certain pharma companies to lower the price of tests and vaccineshttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-advocates-pus...Tuberculosis is not a medical problem, it's an inequality and access problem. Tuberculosis is fully solved in advanced countries yet less developed countries still suffer from it. Pakistan has 260 death per 100k capita, the US has 2.6. The highest 5 countries have at least 600 per 100k capita.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh hey, I had TB. It sucked. I had to be proper quarantined for 3 months, felt like shit for a whole year and a half, and nearly died because I didn't realize I had any symptoms. I thought I was just tired and depressed all the time because I hated my job, and then one day I collapsed from what I thought was a heart attack.I was/am otherwise healthy and must have just drawn the short straw (or it was a very long dwelling infection from a trip abroad years earlier). I really wish we vaccinated for it like Europe. I'd have taken the little scar on my arm for reducing the already small chance of dealing with that shit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I almost lost a former partner to this disease. Totally changed my life.One of my first projects at my development consulting job was a site build for an org working on vaccine candidates, which a decade later, unfortunately haven't crossed the finish line.So with a fairly personal connection with the disease, and the nonzero chance I could one day develop it myself, I have a personal interest in seeing progress in the space.I saw an IAVI update the other day stating TB research is currently only funded to the tune of 1 billion a year when they need 6. 10.5 million infections a year reported. Remember the countries where the disease have the biggest impact have limited diagnostic abilities outside of cities and politically, these countries are very quick to pretend the problem is solved when the reality is that TB started speeding up again in the covid days because the care programs for patients then was put on pause.If you wanna change the world and aren't just out for VC cash, go design a mobile X-Ray unit to take into villages, work on an AI model to diagnose from imagery, and work on figuring out how to speed up the testing because a MGIT machine needing power 24/7 is not the type of equipment you can always get in the places the disease impacts.Figure out how to get those little mycobacteria suckers to divide quicker in agar (my limited biology education tells me mess up the mycoic acid synthesis without killing it?) and then get people a positive result in 3 days instead of 3 weeks. Remember: the very good blood test (quantiferon gold) is banned in the largest country in the world because it comes back positive for the 1/3 of the population latently infected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42046247</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Adventures in Probability" explores various concepts and intriguing aspects of probability theory through engaging anecdotes and examples. It discusses the importance of probability in everyday decision-making, highlights common misconceptions, and illustrates how understanding probability can enhance critical thinking. The author shares personal experiences and reflections on how these ideas can be applied practically, encouraging readers to appreciate the role of chance in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;my professor projected video of himself writing on a piece of paper before a very large auditorium, and that guy was left-handed, and so his hand would cover his notes for like the entire time and it was impossible to see what he was writing. I only figured out that this was why it was so unpleasant like halfway through the class.So many of my college math classes had some version of this professor who took a fascinating subject like linear algebra, statistics or algorithms and made it into a slog. The fact that most stats is taught by getting students to just memorize random ideas rather than building up a holistic and intuitive view really is a travesty.Also makes sense why so many people, even though they took stats in college, hav e such a poor understanding of probability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I think if I were in charge of presenting this material to students I'd do it by introducing the concept of memorylessness and by showing how good memorylessness is, how many wonderful things you can do with it. And then one day I'd be like, "well, it sure would be nice if we had any distributions like that!" and then whirl around with my piece of chalk to deliver the exciting news that we do. Exactly one, in fact.Incidentally, this also goes for the determinant of a matrix. It's got a lot of neat and desirable properties, and it turns out to be the only thing that does. When it was finally taught to me this way, those weird algorithms we use to compute this seemingly-arbitrary number finally made sense. (And, in fact, this is the easiest way to prove that all those algorithms have to be computing the same seemingly-arbitrary number. Because the algorithms preserve the properties that define The Determinant, and The Determinant is the unique thing that preserves all of those properties, so must those algorithms all be computing The Determinant, no matter how different they might look.)So I can vouch that this style of explanation really does work, at least for people like me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisson processes are neat, they always end up working nicely in ways that many other distributions/processes very much don't.Splitting a Poisson process into two lower rate processes is a neat trick. Even better is that you can do the same to convert a Poisson process into one with a variable rate, provided that rate is lower than the original (original may be variable as well).And the fact that the partial sums of a bunch of exponential distributions results in the same distribution of values as picking Poisson(lambda * time) values uniformly at random is pure magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039327</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The page showcases an interactive tool that generates Moore Voronoi diagrams, which are a type of spatial partitioning based on distance to a set of seed points. Users can add seeds on a grid, and the application visually displays the regions associated with each seed, highlighting their influence areas. Additionally, the site explains the mathematical concepts behind Voronoi diagrams and their applications in various fields, such as urban planning and geographic information systems. The focus is on providing an engaging way to explore and understand these geometric structures through visualization and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author's archive of animations is very pleasing: https://bleuje.com/animationsite/2024_1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moore Curve [1] is a sequence of curves that ends up filling a square as the sequence goes to infinity, thus asymptotically mapping [0,1] to [0,1]^2. (phrasing might not be mathematically correct)So, my intuition tells me that what the site creator did is take the 4th Moore curve (which has 256 "corners") in the sequence, then spread 256 points on the [0,1] interval and map the later into the former. The output points then serve as cores for the Voronoi diagram [2]."Adding holes" in the 256 input points thus means to creates gaps in the 256 input points, possibly at regular interval. The animation happens when points slide from adjacent from the gap into the gap. I can't find the exact logic of which point moves when. However, all points move at the same time when there are exactly 128 holes (i.e. 128 points on the curve), and there are three batches of points that move one after the others when there are 64 holes (thus 3 batches of 64 points moving).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_curve[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hint: if you're on mobile, zoom out and go to the bottom left corner. The page appears broken at first, but it's just the layout, at least on iOS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42092835</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article pays tribute to Alexander Grothendieck, a groundbreaking mathematician known for his influential contributions to algebraic geometry and category theory. It highlights his innovative ideas, including the development of schemes and his impact on modern mathematics. The piece also reflects on Grothendieck's unique personality, his philosophical views, and his later life choices, emphasizing his disconnection from the mathematical community and his retreat to a simpler lifestyle. Overall, the homage celebrates Grothendieck's legacy and profound influence on the field of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am from south India where a lot of wild elephants roam the villages and towns. When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Anchali figured out she could interrupt her colleague’s showers by picking the hose up with her trunk and kinking it to stop the water flow.The old tricks are the best tricks. Now wait for them to point the nozzle at their face and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elephants are really smart, and also quite emotional. They have been known to grieve, for very long periods of time, upon the death of babies or partners. Most animals get over it, fairly quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105098</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;I2P is an anonymous network designed to protect users' privacy and security while facilitating peer-to-peer communication and sharing. It operates through layered encryption, allowing users to access sites and services anonymously without revealing their identity. I2P is particularly focused on privacy, offering tools for secure browsing, file sharing, and communications, while also promoting decentralized applications and content hosting. The platform encourages users to contribute to its development and engage with the community for better anonymity and security solutions online.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I really like the concept, I2P is one of those P2P network strongly associated with the darkest corner of the Internet in my mind and something I would rather stay away from (because I would rather not get arrested randomly because I have used it).Now I was just going through the I2P Wikipedia page and I couldn't find anything about that. Are my fears irrational?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe there's a simple boot flag for tails OS that let's you use this instead of Tor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The completely anonymous, built-in torrents in I2P are hugely undervalued. I expected that every big torrent tracker would set up a mirror in I2P in order to allow their users to stay anonymous. I don't understand why they don't do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42032451</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Death and Life of Prediction Markets at Google" discusses the rise and fall of Google's internal prediction markets, which were created to forecast various outcomes, such as employee performance and product success. It explores the motivations behind the establishment of these markets and their potential benefits for decision-making. However, it also delves into the challenges faced, including legal concerns and management skepticism, which ultimately led to their decline. The piece reflects on the lessons learned from Google's experiment with prediction markets and suggests the importance of fostering a culture of open data sharing to enhance forecasting accuracy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.Famously, Microsoft and others pioneered dogfooding decades before the events described in this article and approximately a decade (at least) before Google came into existence.And I’m 99% certain company cafes existed at least a half century before Google invented the concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the article would reflect on the problems with predictions markets, but it's just a dry history.Crucially, "predictions markets" do not and cannot exist in any real sense. A pure predictions market would be completely isolated, causality-wise, from the event they are trying to predict. But the two are not and cannot be isolated, except for some degenerate cases like trying to guess the output of a true random number generator (and even then I'm not so sure sufficiently motivated people wouldn't try to game the system anyway). This is why we have problems with our current predictions markets, e.g. the stock market (insider trading, etc.) and sports betting (match-fixing, etc.).Every prediction with a stake is an incentive to alter the outcome of an event. Once the weight of the stake outweighs the resources being used to ensure the impartiality of the outcome, the wheels fully come off the cart and the prediction stops being about the underlying event and starts self-referentially predicting the impact of the prediction itself. The snake eats its own tail and the market becomes useless. You cannot scale up a predictions market without this eventually coming to pass. See also the famous example of how a predictions market for when public figures will die is just an assassination market with extra steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google’s success wasn’t driven solely by its whimsical culture; the rapid growth of the market played a significant role as well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108360</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent refactor of the Plasma desktop environment's handling of desktop icon positioning. It highlights improvements made to the codebase, which enhance the usability and flexibility of desktop icons. The author details the challenges faced during the development process and the solutions implemented to streamline icon management, ultimately leading to a more efficient user experience. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of such updates in maintaining and evolving desktop environments for better performance and user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny, I maintain xfdesktop (the Xfce component that draws the desktop background and icons), and this past summer I just did a major refactor/rewrite of how xfdesktop saves and restores icon positions as well.Fortunately I didn't have as much trouble in the "reading code is the hardest part" dimension, as I was largely redoing code I myself wrote around 20 years ago (though others had changed it a bit in the meantime).It's fun to see a lot of the same problems I had when modeling how all of this should work.  Xfce 4.20 (probably end of next month) will have all of my changes for this, but of course I expect I've broken some things as well and will have to add in a bunch of little hacks and workarounds.  It's a truly weird, complex problem, even though at first look it feels like it should be simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know how wired earbuds always, always get tangled when you place them in a drawer or your pocket or something for few seconds?Do not wind them around your hand, this creates a curling force that makes them tangle. It’s a fundamental symmetry effect in action, with which you turn a straight line into a knot. Try the same with a flexible ruler tape and you’ll see how much it twists, unless you counter-twist every loop.Instead just gather the wire into a flat compressed /\/\…/\ form and put it there. The worst thing that will happen now is one accidental semi-knot that is trivial to shake away.Now I wonder how that applies to code, maybe we’re onto something here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title made me remember this other example of desktop icons being hard: https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invis...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42085490</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of Australia's 3G network shutdown, highlighting how it affects mobile phone users who rely on 4G and 5G devices for connectivity. It explains that while most modern devices connect to newer networks, older equipment, including some 4G phones that may have relied on 3G for certain functionalities, could be rendered unusable for specific services. The article emphasizes the need for users to understand their devices' compatibility with current networks and offers guidance on how to check and upgrade their phones to ensure continued service.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been handled differently in the UK from a regulatory point of view from an earlier time in the rollout of 4G/5G networks, so things seem to have worked out better.In the UK, carriers are only allowed to provide coverage in any given area to a phone if it is able to make an emergency call (999/112) in that area.i.e. if the phone says you have a signal, you must be able to make an emergency call.So, for a phone to actually show you as being connected to the network:a) There must be 2G/3G coverage available for a CSFB call to take place.orb) The phone must support VoLTE (including for emergency calls).Newer LTE (and 5G) spectrum deployments, like Band 20 LTE (800MHz), are being used to provide coverage in rural areas - even in places where there is no 2G/3G coverage, therefore these newer bands are often only made available to devices that support VoLTE.If you have an old phone, that doesn't support VoLTE (including for emergency calls), then it will only connect to 4G networks in areas where there is still an overlapping 2G/3G layer.This approach means that the carriers have had an incentive to make all devices support VoLTE with emergency calling. It has also been possible for the carriers to promote the 800MHz coverage as only being available on newer phones with VoLTE.Thus much of the problems that Australia is having have been avoided.Also:Data-only devices aren't included in this requirement, as they can't/don't make emergency calls.Roaming devices aren't affected (as far as I know).UK carriers support VoLTE roaming in the USA, given the lack of 2G/3G networks for CSFB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last minute change, and leaving it up to the carriers. Bad to the power of bad.I tend to buy grey import handsets because they offer a better value proposition - by a long margin - than locally sold handsets. Allowing the carriers to define the block list only plays into their greedy little hands.I know that "band 28" support is something useful to Australians who, like me, buy handsets from overseas. The support of handsets should be based on capabilities of the device, not a seemingly arbitrary list that's under the control of the carriers. But that's what happens when last minute decisions are made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s surprising the things that have been caught offguard by this.In Melbourne, the ticketing terminal in 200 trams and 2500 buses is now broken.https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/free-ride-as-myk...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103257</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried Pulumi 5 years ago because the idea looked cool and you could write code instead of HCL and apply things like loops etc.However, the problem I found was that a Pulumi provider has two "sides", one is on the Pulumi side of the provider, which sets up resources to be created, but doesn't update them with the details of what's been created.Example (may not be entirely accurate): You create a VPC, but then you want to use the default subnet as an input to another resource. You can't find out that subnet's information because when Pulumi runs, the "script" side doesn't get updated by the result of the VPC creation, so the information like the default subnet is "inside" the provider and not available to the user's script.Terraform updates the resource that has been created with the information from the creation, so you can access the underlying AWS information in further resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole tech looks kinda' cool, but this video...I've noticed a trend where some of the dev tooling nowadays is sold almost as if it were consumer goods with the whole associated marketing behind it. This doesn't work for me, in reality actually has completely opposite effect. Give me boring well-written docs, that shows engineering that went into it, not the marketing show for teenagers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers who are unfamiliar with SST would do well to read a bit about the project, the backing company, and the work they've been doing. Things have come around full-bore from serverless-only on AWS via CDK, putting huge effort into trying to make CDK fast and seamless, realizing they needed to support more than AWS and that CDK/CF are just too slow, transitioning into a Pulumi backend, supporting other clouds, and now, containers.SST is great because they built a model for infra-as-code that gives sensible defaults out-of-the-box while preserving enormous flexibility as the architecture grows, plus great conventions around giving code access to the environment details via bindings.Super excited to play with this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105797</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of evolving a NoSQL database schema, outlining the challenges and strategies involved in adapting the schema to accommodate changing data needs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the data and user requirements, and suggests techniques such as versioning, gradual migrations, and careful planning to minimize disruption. The author also highlights the significance of using appropriate databases and tools for specific use cases and provides insights into best practices for maintaining a flexible and scalable schema as applications grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would strongly recommend against using a fixed key 'user' for the hash key on dynamodb, with the range key being used to select the actual record. DDB does not handle splitting by range key very well, so you will run into load balance and throttling issues even with the sharding scheme (i.e. 'user!2') mentioned later.It will save you a lot of headaches to make the hash key the actual userid (e.g. 'user!abcdef123456'). This will make it more expensive if you do need to occasionally scan all users, but it's not drastically so. You can either do scan and ignore stuff you don't care about, or maintain an index that just contains the userids (in a similar hash/range key as the article) and then do point gets for each userid for the actual data. This will spread the load of these scans out better, because the range scan contains little data compared to if all user data is stored in the range key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very informative read … however, I am left not really understanding what the Entity Manager is … perhaps a migration tool to move data from NoSQL to RDBMS, perhaps a front end helper service? Is it FOSS, a PAYG service? How can I deploy it? Perhaps this article long enough already and is intended to whet our appetite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save yourself a ton of grief and don't use things like dynamodb unless you really have to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103788</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty amazing effort, this looks like a great labour of love!I can't give feedback on the code/technology, but on the writing on the lore section, I would try to simplify the writing. For instance the following:&gt; The reverberations of the trumpet stirred the knights from their deep repose, igniting a tumultuous awakening. With swords unsheathed and hearts ablaze, they clashed in a thunderous symphony of war, each seeking to claim dominance over the waking realm.Feels too ornate (purple prose) and could be more directly put as:&gt; The trumpet’s call jolted the knights from their rest. Swords drawn and hearts alight, they clashed in a fierce battle, each striving for dominance.I'm not an author or anything, but a little bit of copy writing could help - although this might just be me as it's probably a matter of personal taste!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's your experience been like with Nix?How do you feel about devenv vs stock Nix?

&lt;p&gt;The article "Boeing Wonderland: The Fake Cities on America's West Coast" explores the intricate and elaborate mock cities built by Boeing for testing and training purposes during the Cold War. These simulated environments, designed to resemble urban areas, were created to evaluate the performance of military aircraft and to prepare pilots for real-life scenarios. The piece highlights the ingenuity behind these constructions, their strategic significance, and how they shaped military aviation tactics during that era.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating. Funny side effect:&gt; Warner Brothers executives later insisted that their own lot receive the “Kelley Treatment.” They decided that their sound stages looked too much like aircraft hangers from the air, and feared that Japanese bombardiers, fooled by the Clover Field camouflage—or by Lockheed’s, only three miles to the north—would bomb their studio instead!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This cool. I grew up about a mile from one of these plants and it is wild to see the old photos. A story from my grandfather (probably not true) is that the week after Pearl Harbor Jack Warner had someone paint on the roof of the Warner Bros Studio something like “Hirohito, Northrop is over there”. When Jack Northrop heard this he was furious and gave Mr Warner one of the rare verbal lashings of his life. As a token of remorse Warner offered to lend the studio’s staff to help camouflage the aircraft plant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The very first name that came to my mind was Jasper Maskelyne. He led British camouflage efforts during WWII, and sure enough, while they don't come right out and say it, the mention of him studying British work makes me think that Ohmer must have worked with him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054327</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basically this is what Figma could be if you could add behavior to the UI. Somehow the web has been running backwards for years now. We lost flash in favor of HTML 5, which sort of fizzled out in terms of creative people actually doing a lot with it. We used to have simple application builders in IDEs like Visual Basic, Delphi, Borland JBuilder. Even Eclipse had a simple swing UI builder thing for a while. For the web we had dream weaver, frontpage, etc.I'm not saying those tools were perfect; because they weren't. But we never really got good substitutes for them. We now have people "designing" stuff in Figma and then handing over for implementation to some developer team that essentially then recreates the whole thing pretty much from scratch. There's something deeply stupid/wasteful about needing to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nicely done, now a Delphi and I can finally be happy about the state of development again.Sourcecode: https://github.com/BAndysc/AvaloniaVisualBasic6Edit: someone information about Lazarus deleted their comment, my answer;I know about Lazarus yes; I use it for my old projects. I would like a modern version that also works in-browser and .NET seems good for that as this shows. Maybe based on this https://pascalabc.net/en/ .Not kidding; I still enjoy Pascal/Lazarus (and common lisp) programming more than anything current; none of the anxiety and all of the joy and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was so productive in VB5/6 back in the late 90s/early 00s. I made tons of utility apps to solve all kinds of little problems. It was just so easy to put things together. I tried to make the transition to vb.net but it was not the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105869</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems fundamentally unsuitable for its stated purpose, which is “understanding human behavior”.While it may, as it says, produce “convincing interactions”, there is no basis at all peesented for believing it produces an accurate model of human behavior, so using it to “understand human behavior” is at best willful self-deception, and probably, with a little effort at tweaking inputs to produce the desired results, most often when used by someone who presents it as “enlightening productivity and business scenarios” it will be an engine for simply manufacturing support for a pre-selected option.It is certainly easier and cheaper than exploring actual human interactions to understand human behavior, but then so is just using a magic 8-ball, which may be less convincing, but for all the evidence supporting this is just as accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like this defaults to GPT-4o: https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/7ae16568ad1c4de...If you're going to try this out I would strongly recommend running it against GPT-4o mini instead. Mini is 16x cheaper and I'm confident the results you'll get out of it won't be 1/16th as good for this kind of experiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love jupyter notebooks. And, I'm amazed that a company like Microsoft would put a notebook front and center that starts off with a bunch of errors. Not a good look. I really think you can improve your AI marketing by a lot by creating compelling jupyter notebooks. Unsloth is a great example of the right way.https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108109</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a study on the effectiveness of various healing practices, focusing on the influence of intention in the healing process. It highlights the lack of strong empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of alternative healing methods compared to conventional medicine. Through an analysis of different studies and approaches, the authors discuss the psychological aspects of healing and the potential benefits of belief and expectation in treatment outcomes. The paper ultimately calls for a more rigorous scientific examination of healing practices to establish their validity and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're increasingly aware today of how the media operates cycles of self-referential and self-justifying citations: a TV show will quote an article that reports "some people" taking an issue, which ends up being a quote from someone interviewed for another newspaper article.. and so on. This "legitimacy laundering" is rampant, and we're now getting towards media literacy levels which expose it for many people.However, most concerning: this is how academia has always worked. It's the great absurdity of peer review, and of citation. This is how entire fields can sustain themselves with little or no scientific validity (esp. see, psychometrics).We are no where near the equivalent "academic literacy" for generally informed members of the public to understand this problem. Entire fields can be sustained with zero "empirical pressure" to close down. So long as one can cite another who can cite another... and somewhere some government body will take these citations as prima facie evidence of a research programme, then funding will be given and more papers published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Besides the sociological problems listed, we must always be conscious of how counterintuitive and difficult statistical inference itself can be.  Good things to search for are statistical fallacies, probabilistic paradoxes and books like Counterexamples in Probability.And it is not sufficient to read about them once or twice; researchers who use statistical inference regularly must revisit these caveats at least as regularly.Myself, I have taught Probability and Statistics many times, discussed and dispelled many misconceptions by students.  Would I be 100% sure I will not be caught up in a fallacy while informally thinking about probability?  I wouldn't even be 10% sure; any intuition I conjure up, I would triple check as rigorously as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On page 11 there is a mention of taking the result of self reporting (surveys) at their word. I’ve wondered about this issue not just in science but other situations. For example political polling, data point in time surveys, census, etc. Without verification, what good is the data? And yet you often see such self reported data quoted by articles or papers as if it were factual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42049018</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has been saving my ticket stubs for 20+ years I was very frustrated by the disappearance of physical tickets. I paid the extra fee to have them mailed to me, but eventually that went away. Printed emails are not the same.I eventually figured out how to make the most realistic replica ticket stubs possible to add to my ticket stub album. I spent several thousands dollars on professional printers and real stock as well as months building my own software to customize and print tickets, all to scratch my own itch. Now my collection continues to grow with the 20 or so shows I go to every year and I've helped over 16,000+ people do the same with my website https://stubforge.com, which I'm now lucky enough to run full time.A lot of people don't get it, and that's ok, but for those that do, they really get it.People buy our tickets to give as gifts (because it's not easy to do anymore in a non-awkward or non-art project fashion), to add to their collections, to frame with posters, to use as surprise proposals, to invite people to their weddings, to announce their pregnancies and more things I never would have imagined when I started.There are people that do miss ephemera. Even if you don't look at it that often, it's something precious to you. It doesn't matter if your kids will get it or just chuck it, it's there for you to enjoy and remember in the fashion that you want to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They tell us what it was like to be there.Personal memories can be made in innumerable ways. The absence of tickets doesn't mean memories, or physical representations of memories, are going away.As for academic interest, I have to imagine there's a digital repository of playbills or the information therein somewhere that's easily searchable. After all, these types of resources exist for other performances like pro wrestling and mixed martial arts in the form of cagematch &amp; sherdog. I may not have my ticket stub from my first match, but I can still look it up by venue, year and the matches I remember. I can find contemporary news reports and reviews. This can be supplemented with web forum discussions and other social media, blogs, etc. people crave this type of discussion, documentation and artifacts that prove their fandom. I don't think they care about the medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of even an OPTION to get a proper, physical ticket makes TicketMaster's obscene rip-off even more outrageous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42080327</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent research suggesting that standing desks, often seen as a healthier alternative to sitting all day, may not provide the expected benefits. Instead, prolonged standing can lead to discomfort and health issues similar to those caused by extended sitting. The study highlights the importance of movement and breaks rather than simply switching from sitting to standing, advocating for a balanced approach that incorporates regular physical activity throughout the day to promote overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an article [1] from a few years ago from Cornell ergonomics researchers that is still relevant the discusses the pluses and minuses of both sitting and standing desks.Here is their recommendation:&gt; Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes. Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).[1] https://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tought this is common knowledge. Sitting all day - bad. Standing all day, also bad. Like, first docummented RSI were people standing at their stations in manufacturing, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study argues that movement is better than a static position (standing or sitting). Shocker.What they're obviously missing is that when you're at a standing desk, the friction to engaging in some kind of movement is drastically decreased (unless you're talking about spinning).While I stand at my desk, I frequently find myself pacing, jogging in place, stretching, etc. I don't have to first GET UP OUT OF A CHAIR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103761</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Apple's recent advertising strategy that emphasizes the company's advancements in artificial intelligence, arguing that the portrayal of AI as a groundbreaking achievement is misleading. It suggests that while Apple promotes its AI capabilities, the actual implementation and impact may not be as revolutionary as advertised. The author highlights concerns over the potential for such initiatives to distract from more pressing technological issues and questions the effectiveness of Apple's approach in genuinely enhancing user experience. Ultimately, the piece calls for a more transparent and realistic discussion about the role of AI in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; Where’s the positive ad with [...] a businessperson using it to understand a complex report dumped on them minutes before a meeting?There is literally exactly that ad.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BK8bnkcT0NgImho, it's one of the best "Why AI?" ads I've seen so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember -- the lazy, bad at your job, etc. assumptions are attributes you are putting on the characters in the ads. At no point in the world of the ad are these indicated by any of the other participants. Side character emotions are typically limited to confusion, interest, admiration, disbelief, and the ilk. Ultimately in each of the examples the participants are left holding what they "wanted", be it a sentimental birthday wish or a business correspondence that is "up to snuff".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy?This attitude seems aligned with Apple's general assumption (and apparent preference) that iOS users remain passive media consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111094</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR), which aims to promote the use of open-source software in public administrations across Europe. It offers resources, guidelines, and a repository of open-source projects to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among public sector organizations. The initiative seeks to support transparency, interoperability, and the reduction of costs associated with software development and procurement in government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So 16 coefficients are stored for a rank 3 wavelet function.With 16 DoF, can you handle more overlapping objects than a 16-long per-pixel list?Without fully understanding it, this reminds me of spherical harmonics in the way that juggling around the channels is convenient but it's not magic, you can only do so much with X degrees of freedom. (SH is a really nice way to store a low-res cubemap, but you would never use SH for env maps on something shiny) In the case of SH there are also artifacts introduced. I wonder how the wavelets behave when pushed too hard?Also, trying to be constructive - If there were still images with objects lined-up so we could compare the different techniques with a reference and see the difference, that would be easier to read than a lot of fast-moving randomly-colored objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first real brick wall I met when learning computer graphics, interesting how seemingly simple things in computer graphics is actually non-trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember when I was looking into this at one point in time. I was trying to figure out a good implementation that didn't require you to store multiple different positions. The most I really ever got was a reverse order transparency [1] which employs some stuff similar to the article.My plan was basically render everything opaque first, then render transparency front to back till the layer became opaque (discard all pixels under an already opaque pixel), and of course exclude everything further away than the depth buffer of the opaque layer.Might be interesting to actually go and finish the implementation to test it out, I just never had a good test scene with a lot of transparency (with an opaque layer since half my benefit comes from that.)[1] https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msyGDR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106477</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ineffectiveness of traditional security controls in protecting organizations from threats. It argues that security measures often create a false sense of security and highlights the need for a more adaptive approach that focuses on understanding actual risks rather than simply implementing standardized controls. The author emphasizes the importance of developing a security mindset that prioritizes critical thinking and contextual awareness over compliance with set protocols. Overall, the piece calls for a reevaluation of how security is approached in order to improve resilience against evolving challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been thinking about this topic thru the lens of moral philosophy lately.A lot of the “big lists of controls” security approaches correspond to duty ethics: following and upholding rules is the path to ethical behaviour. IT applies this control, manages exceptions, tracks compliance, and enforces adherence. Why? It’s the rule.Contrast with consequentialism (the outcome is key) or virtue ethics (exercising and aligning with virtuous characteristics), where rule following isn’t the main focus. I’ve been part of (heck, I’ve started) lots of debates about the value of some arbitrary control that seemed out of touch with reality, but framed my perspective on virtues (efficiency, convenience) or outcomes (faster launch, lower overhead). That disconnect in ethical perspectives made most of those discussions a waste of time.A lot of security debates are specific instances of general ethical situations; threat models instead of trolley problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of the security "industry" is about useless compliance, rather than actual security. The chimps have put their fears into large enterprise compliance documents. This teaches the junior security people at enterprise companies that these useless fears are necessary, and they pass them along to their friends. Why? Not just because of chimps and fear, but also $$. There is a ton of money to be made off of silly chimps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ironic thing about the chimp story is that probably chimps are immune to the problem and humans are the only species that would fall for it. It takes chimps a long time to learn to copy others. I doubt they could sustain a superstition like this for long even if you managed to induce it through great effort.It's humans that copy each other without a second thought. It's a great heuristic on average. These kinds of fables are correctives against our first instinct to replicate other's behaviors, but if we actually tried to reason through everything from first principles we'd never get anything done.Copying is the plain pieces in the lucky charms, thinking things through is the marshmallows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110149</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the concept of "topological tensor products" and explores various properties and applications related to the construction and understanding of these products in the context of functional analysis and topology. It outlines the mathematical frameworks and theorems pertinent to the subject, emphasizing the significance of these tensor products in different mathematical scenarios, including their role in duality and the integration of various algebraic structures. The paper serves as a detailed examination intended for an audience familiar with advanced mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; byoyomi has all but been replaced by Canadian OvertimeNote that this is from 1997. It was common to use clocks in Europe that were unable to do proper Japanese style byoyomi and we did not have one timekeeper per board in tournaments. When I run out of time we paused the clock, I put for example 15 stones in front of me, closed the stone box, set my the clock for example to 10 minutes and start playing again. I would lose if I ended the time again with any stone left in front of me.Clocks that could do byoyomi, and multiple rounds of it, started to be widespread not much after those years. I think we used them in the European Championship of 1996. A common byoyomi was 30 seconds per move. If I had one euro per each time I heard a clock saying "30 seconds one time" I'd be rich.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Go players I know prefer the simplicity and elegance of Fischer time [1].
No more pausing the clock to count out N stones, or worries about using less
time than allotted for your N moves and wasting the rest.
I don't mind seeing byoyomi become a relic of the past...[1] https://polgote.com/en/blog/time-controls-go-byo-yomi-fische...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the time settings that are or were historically used in Go tournaments had their own quirks and idiosyncrasies that added charm to the time management issue. At the same time, I can understand the tediousness of Canadian being an argument not to use it anymore. Last time I played with it was at a tournament in Brussels where they were using old-school chess clocks, effectively making it the only viable solution.Nowadays, as mentioned, Fischer trumps all with its simplicity, but some still enjoy playing with byoyomi (supported both by newer chess clocks and by old Ing clocks), since they got used to managing their thinking time in regular intervals once base time was spent. Personally, I've been advocating using Fischer for the longest time, since said management strategies were more natural to me in this case, and I'm glad DGT clocks became the common standard at tournaments now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42038219</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;AlphaFold3 is a project developed by Google DeepMind, focused on improving protein structure prediction using artificial intelligence. It builds on the success of its predecessor, AlphaFold2, by enhancing the model's accuracy, speed, and user accessibility. The software aims to facilitate scientific research by providing tools that allow researchers to predict protein folding and interactions more efficiently. The repository includes code, model parameters, and documentation to help users implement and customize the AlphaFold3 framework for various applications in biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on the shipping process for small businesses, covering essential aspects like choosing the right carrier, understanding shipping options, and packaging products effectively. It emphasizes the importance of calculating shipping costs accurately, offers tips for streamlining the fulfillment process, and highlights common mistakes to avoid. The guide also touches on international shipping considerations and how to enhance customer satisfaction through efficient shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. I particularly liked this observation:&gt; Shipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.A lot of the ideas in here resonated with me a lot. This is the kind of article I wish I'd read before I spent a few years leading an engineering team at a medium-sized tech company!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post is about corporate politics, not "shipping projects."  To wit:  If you ship something users hate and makes no money, but 
  your leadership team is happy, you still shipped. You can 
  feel any way you like about that, but it’s true. If you 
  don’t like it, you should probably go work for companies 
  that really care how happy their users are.

When the stated goal is to make leadership happy and not solving customer problems such that customers are "happy", that is pretty much the definition of politics.  As subsequently identified therein:  Engineers who think shipping means delivering a spec or 
  deploying code will repeatedly engineer their way into

I would question the ethics of engineers whom employ a strategy of preferring politics over delivering solutions.EDIT: clarified the ethical question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There should be a hardware product version of this, you software people have no idea.- Have endless arguments about what to name the product- Have industrial design team enforce the latest design language- Create product variant SKU numbers, get them loaded into ordering system.  Get buy-in from sales on these variants.- Create part numbers for the FRUs and CRUs.- Create multi-level BOM for all the variants.- Buy replacement parts and push them into parts depots- Calculate reliability so that warranty department knows how much to charge you- Get agency approvals- Create packaging- Test packaging- Translate any words on the package into french (for Canada)- Get vendors to sign your big company environmental requirements document- Write legal notices and get it translated into many languages- Work with documentation team to get printed (usually short) manual translated into many languages- Get safety engineer to sign off on products, usually means you need to make a bunch of stickers and include them in the BoM.- Figure out the part numbers for the power cords needed for each country- Figure out the part numbers for the rack mount rail kits for various types of racks that you support- Write announcement letter- Create videos and documents for sales team training- Write troubleshooting guide- Train repair centeretc..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111031</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The project "I Don't Have Spotify" aims to provide a solution for users who want to access curated Spotify playlists without needing a Spotify account. It allows users to browse music recommendations and playlists, offering alternative links to online streaming platforms. The repository includes instructions for setup and usage, along with code examples for developers interested in contributing or customizing the tool. The focus is on enhancing music accessibility for those who may not want or be able to use Spotify directly.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know of a even more impressive website that will transfer playlists from Spotify (or 20 other platforms, including text files) to 20 other platforms or a text file. I will share the link, but don't hug it to death y'all. :)https://app.tunemymusic.com/transfer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a very simple chrome extension that automatically redirects you to your preferred music service when visiting another service. In my case I have it set to YouTube Music, so if I click a Spotify (or other) link in Slack, I'll be redirected to YouTube Music.https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/music-link/gnhphofp...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to actually buy music and store it myself, as I've started noticing more and more that some of the songs I have on Spotify have started to disappear, but I find it very difficult to buy modern music anymore. Most gets released as singles, and as far as I know, to only streaming platforms. Is there a way to still buy the same kind of music that is on streaming platforms, and actually get the audio files?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110877</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Visualizing the Past: World War II" explores various methods and tools for visualizing historical data and events from World War II. It emphasizes the importance of visual representation in understanding complex historical narratives, using maps, graphs, and interactive tools to illustrate the war's impact and dynamics. The content highlights notable visualizations that convey key statistics, geographic movements, and significant battles, aiming to engage audiences in a deeper analysis of the war’s context and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expected to spend a couple of minutes browsing this, yet 25 minutes later I'm not even halfway through.The best (so far) are the ones above the strings "on June 2nd, 1940" and "effort by Russian War Relief". I can't imagine the amount of research and sheer work (especially pre-internet) to create these.I was a kid who played SimCity 2000, RISK, and had tons of books about geography. Having physical pieces of paper that I'd spend minutes or hours analyzing was so satisfying. Scrolling around Google Earth or doing GIS-based analysis is also satisfying, but I really got a kick out of looking at this post (putting aside the seriousness of WW2).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently finished a large World War II project that covered the full timeline of the war, and Google Maps was a valuable tool to follow what was happening in any given battle. The problem is Google Maps has more detail than you need, so trying to follow something like Operation Market Garden is much more difficult than just looking at this beautiful battle map: https://www.alamy.com/a-bridge-too-far-image68088140.html. "The West Point Atlas of War" is another great resource.Maps cover the spatial side of war, but in addition it's difficult to follow the timeline. My project stitched popular World War II movies together into a chronological series, making it easier to see what was happening across the world at any given time. You can view the episodes and the full blog post here: https://open.substack.com/pub/ww2supercut/p/combining-143-wo.... And in addition "The Second World War" by Churchill's biographer Martin Gilbert, is a chronological, 750 page book that I couldn't put down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 1944 World Almanac. It's incredibly detailed on World War Two - by my count, page 31 and 35-113 are mostly or totally devoted to it, in addition to the various bits on armies scattered throughout. Sometimes I look at it just to see what happened on that particular day (for instance: today, German forces landed in Leros, in the Aegean Sea, which was at the time held by the British, among many other events - and that just in 1943!) There are also some incredibly detailed war maps which I sometimes look at. At some point I should probably get around to uploading them, as they are absolutely amazing and I'd like to share it, but it's always near the bottom of my to-do list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110588</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the GitHub plugin created by the author, which addresses concerns raised by coworkers about code maintainability and collaboration. The plugin offers a solution to improve code quality by providing features that encourage best practices and enhance communication among team members. The author reflects on their experiences with the plugin's development, the feedback received from coworkers, and how it aims to foster a healthier coding environment by avoiding common pitfalls and promoting clearer documentation. Overall, the piece highlights the importance of teamwork and thoughtful coding in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the features of https://codescene.com/It looks for knowledge islands and relates those to frequently modified code, to identify hotspot, or areas of high risk due to low knowledge distribution in areas of high change.Another use is if someone hands in their notice you can easily see all the code that only they know, so your handover planning is mapped out easily.I’ve never thought of it being used maliciously, it’s for visibility. It would be a shitty manager that would use it that way and if they’re already shitty then this tool won’t change that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon has these numbers easily accessible as reports on their code systems runnable at any manager level, and many other ways to inspect what the team is doing and the risks you might have. I find them useful.Bus factor is one way to think of it. Another is it lets you spot silos, or engineers who aren't working with others, or places where you can't as easily move engineers around (so you can fix that).Some developers fear fungability, they think that that one system only they know is job security. I see it the other way, I see that as a technical risk, but also a thing that might be keeping a great engineer from working on more important projects. Or the way to work on something else when you get fed up with that one system you hate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why does gnu parallel use all the cores when we tell it to use only 8? We only saw eight git clone processes at a time, but a large number of git index-pack processes that maxed out all 32 cores on my laptop. I’m guessing git’s index-pack is a forked subprocess and allows parallel to start another git clone?Parallel is running 8 git clone jobs at once (as asked for) and each git clone is starting as many index-pack threads as it wants. Temporarily setting pack.threads to 1 (via git config) would help here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111260</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "leaving and waving," highlighting the emotional complexities involved in farewells and transitions. It emphasizes the significance of acknowledging both the sorrow of parting and the importance of embracing new beginnings. The author shares personal insights and reflections on the experiences of leaving behind familiar places and people, encouraging readers to find ways to honor their connections while also embracing change. Through themes of gratitude and acceptance, the piece serves as a reminder of the dual nature of farewells and the potential for growth that comes with them.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing up I didn't really know my father. He was an alcoholic and spent his time with his friends drinking when I was young. My parents separated when I was around 8 years old and I haven't seen my father since, even till this day (I am around 30).I was never really close with my mother. We would eat dinner in separate rooms. We grew more and more distant throughout my teen years and when I was 20 I decided to disown her and we're now estranged.There were multiple attempts to "get back" but none were successful. I think what I realised in the end was that she was too much of a free spirit. She wanted to have her separate life and have me co-exist in it, without dedicating herself to me like a parent normally would.I don't think I'll miss them or feeling anything for them when they pass. My mother, maybe a little. My father, not at all. But I don't forsee being at her death bed, even if she told me she was dying. Maybe I'm just stubborn or am held captive by a matter of "principle and integrity". If a relationship is cut off, then it's cut off. Meaning you both have to deal with the good and the bad. I've decided there's more good than bad.In some senses it feels like I never had parents at all. Like there's nothing to miss, because how can one miss an absence?I hope though to be the parent I never had to my daughter. Unfortunately my partner has stage 4 cancer so won't be around for most of my daughter's life at a very young age, but that's okay. This is life and life is me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The finality of death feels impossible to grasp. I think of this with my parents who are in their 90s and live on the other side of the world. I also think of it with my own children - how do you say goodbye when you’re the one leaving?I love the story these photographs tell. I’m an avid archiver of our family’s photos.The other thing I did was to interview my parents 20 years ago to document their life experience in one go from their perspective (separately, because they are different).Maybe not everyone is a nostalgic, but for those of us who are - I encourage doing these things now. It’s never to late to start and they might bring comfort both today and when you wave your last goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made me think of this bit from Tim Urban’s classic blog post, The Tail End[0]:&gt;It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.[0] https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113113</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The document discusses the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving innovation across various sectors, emphasizing its potential to transform industries, enhance productivity, and foster economic growth. It outlines key areas where AI is making significant impacts, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, and examines the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its implementation. The piece also highlights the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and educational institutions, to harness AI's capabilities responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the conclusions:&gt; I find that AI substantially boosts materials discovery, leading to an increase in patent filing and a rise in downstream product innovation. However, the technology is effective only when paired with sufficiently skilled scientists.I can see the point here. Today I was exploring the possibility of some new algorithm. I asked Claude to generate some part which is well know (but there are not a lot of examples on the internet) and it hallucinated some function. In spite of being bad, it was sufficiently close to the solution that I could myself "rehallucinate it" from my side, and turn it into a creative solution. Of course, the hallucination would have been useless if I was not already an expert in the field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Survey evidence
reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82% of scientists report reduced
satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.”What an interesting finding and not what I was expecting. Is this an issue with the UX/tooling? Could we alleviate this with an interface that still incorporates the joy of problem solving.I haven’t seen any research that Copilot and similar tools for programmers have a similar  reduction in satisfaction. Likely with how much the tools feel like an extension of traditional auto complete, and you still spend a lot of time “programming”. You haven’t abandoned your core skill.Related: I often find myself disabling copilot when I have a fun problem I want the satisfaction of solving myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The tool automates a majority of “idea
generation” tasks, reallocating scientists to the new task of evaluating model-suggested candidate
compounds. In the absence of AI, researchers devote nearly half their time to conceptualizing
potential materials. This falls to less than 16% after the tool’s introduction. Meanwhile, time spent
assessing candidate materials increases by 74%"So the AI is in charge, and mostly needs a bunch of lab assistants."Machines should think. People should work." - not a joke any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115310</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impressive energy efficiency and performance of the M4 Mac Minis, highlighting their capabilities for various tasks, including development and content creation. The author shares personal experiences with the device, emphasizing its low power consumption while delivering remarkable processing power. Additionally, the article compares the M4 Mac Mini's performance with other systems and provides insights into its advantages for both home and professional use, making a case for its value as a computing choice.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use Linux, but I think the cheapest M4 Mini offers an incredible value and efficiency per €. With education discount, it's around €650, including VAT. It's pretty hard to find such a silent and powerful machine for that little. Any comparable options?A good fanless build with a i3-14100T is more expensive and 40-50% slower on Geekbench. An i5 is a bit closer. Some 2024 Ryzen CPUs can match or exceed its multicore performance, but these are also more expensive and much less energy efficient. Pricewise, things start favoring PCs if you need more RAM, as Mac upgrades are costly.One can potentially use Nix on a Mac Mini to keep similar development environments to those used in Linux, but AFAIK some packages are not supported on ARM. Any experiences using Nix and nix-darwin as a daily driver?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom.”While I think Apple was off the rocker on this particular decision, I do respect their org structure that allows this type of decision to occur. Believe me, there are companies where a dozen people or more would weigh in and prevent an unpopular choice. Consensus sometimes hinders a desired result (both good and bad).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mac mini M4 performance is around 4-5x in DaVinci Resolve for me - compared to my HP laptop (i5-1135G7).Rendering HDR video was around 12fps there on the i5 - the same project in the Mac mini gets 60fps.The M4 10 core GPU seems on par or better with a mobile RTX3060(65W) for video tests (NR / Deflicker) so I'm also impressed about the M4's efficiency. A lot of power per Watt.It's becoming a dedicated video rendering machine for me where all the SMB auto mounting issues with macOS seem solvable. Pretty happy so far with the base model price even in the EU. The power button placement is an annoyance for me, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120311</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the innovative use of Apple AirPods as a makeshift hearing aid, highlighting how users have discovered ways to optimize the earbuds for amplifying sound and improving listening experiences in various environments. It explores the technology behind the AirPods, detailing the features that make them suitable for this purpose, while also addressing the implications for hearing assistance accessibility and the potential impact on traditional hearing aids. The piece reflects on user experiences and the growing trend of repurposing consumer electronics for health-related functions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Hearing aids typically cost anywhere from ₹ 50,000 to upwards of ₹ 8L depending on the correction capabilityFor those who don't recognize the ₹ symbol it is the symbol for the Indian Rupee and an "L" after a number means 100,000, so ₹ 8L is ₹ 800,000.At current exchange rates that puts hearing aids in India from $600 to upwards of $9,500.AirPods Pro 2 are ₹ 24,900 ($295).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It appears that the Hearing Aid feature is actually an equalizer preset that is pushed to the AirPods and will replace your transparency mode.Apple could've just not marketed these as "hearing aids" or used the medical terminology, as every other TWS with parametric EQ and transparency mode can do the same thing, and they wouldn't have the regulatory hawks going after them. They only lose the marketing edge, but perhaps that was a huge calculated risk.There's an incredible amount of processing power and flexibility in these things. Even the sub-$10 ones using the infamous JieLi SoCs - a 160MHz 32-bit computer in each ear. I'm surprised there hasn't yet been any TWS advertised with open-source firmware, although there's been some work in the usual Chinese (and Russian) communities on customisations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Since WiFi and a microwave operate at the same frequency (2.4GHz), we ran our leaky microwave at full power to block out any persistent network signals in the air.Incidentally, WiFi tries to intentionally avoid this interference.  Microwaves output no power during the zero crossing of the AC line that's driving it, and in this interval, there is no signal in the air to jam things.  WiFi listens before sending (so as to avoid stepping on other stations), and the microwave's signal is enough to trigger this.  (I forget if microwave ovens are "half wave" and you get 1/120th of a second 60 times a second, or if there is just a threshold near the zero crossing where there isn't enough power to interfere.)I would say it's likely that the microwave oven didn't really do much here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118399</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports on the incident involving a Marine Corps pilot who lost command after ejecting from an F-35B aircraft that continued to fly for an extended distance before crashing. The incident raised significant safety and operational concerns, prompting investigations into the circumstances surrounding the pilot's decision to eject and the aircraft's capabilities. The piece highlights the complexities of flying advanced military jets and the potential consequences of such emergencies for pilots and their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're familiar with USA military history, the Americans are (were) famous for not doing things by the book for the right reasons, and letting common sense prevail, as well as incentivizing good outcomes.“A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.”“The reason that the American Navy does so well in wartime is that war is chaos, and the Americans practice chaos on a daily basis.”So heavily simplifying things and with 20/20 hindsight this pilot essentially didn't do the right thing, even if through no fault of their own, and apparently in the US Navy you don't get rewarded for doing the wrong thing. This is what keeping incentives aligned looks like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The report criticizes the pilot for ejecting, but also says he did everything by the book (F35 manual), but the book was wrong. And the pilot should've figured that out? Feels like they just need someone to blame for losing the plane.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brief summary and my understanding of why this occurred:    - Pilot ejects, survives while losing very expensive plane
    - The crash is Marine's third in several weeks, the other two having fatalities; leads to a safety stand down across the entire corps
    - Investigation concludes that ejection was unnecessary and so fault of the crash is on the pilot, however adding that the procedures written were overly broad
    - Pilot is offered to lead VMX-1 after all this; key part of the responsibility is improving procedures

Reading between the lines, it appears that somewhere in the leadership was a belief that putting the pilot in charge of VMX-1 was an opportunity for both; let the guy who made a mistake move forward as they'll be least likely to make it twice kind of thing. General Eric disagreed and ordered him out; it's not stated whether that was based on his own judgement only or if others in VMX-1 lost confidence and that factored in. Nobody disagrees that they have the ability to fire him for what happened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098475</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of defensive communication in interpersonal conflicts, highlighting how individuals often react defensively when they feel threatened. It explores the psychological mechanisms behind defensive communication, such as rationalization and denial, and examines various strategies to foster more constructive communication. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own defensive responses and the impact they can have on resolving conflicts, advocating for open dialogue and active listening to improve relationships and communication outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“As a person becomes more and more defensive, he or she becomes less and less able to perceive accurately the motives, the values and the emotions of the sender.”Such a great insight. The content of defensive communication isn’t a requirement here. Anything that increases the defensiveness of the communicator/listener lowers the ability to perceived.Fear makes us stupid. No plan for future civilization can succeed on fear-based tactics alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an insightful read. Especially for its time! I struggle with being defensive at home; for example if a mistake that I've made is pointed out, my first reaction is to deny or look for excuses rather than to empathise with the other person, who may be feeling upset and unheard as something has happened for the nth time. For some reason, this doesn't happen to anywhere near the same degree at work, where I am fully able to own my mistakes and look for ways forward.Text at this level of emotional abstraction can be quite difficult to internalise, especially for those with less practise or who might be "on the spectrum". It's helpful to have one or two illustrative examples in each category. For example:Evaluative: "Sort out your code before sending it for review, it's an absolute mess yet again and wastes my time."Descriptive: "After an initial review I can see code style issues A, B, C, some of which also occured in PRs X, Y, Z. Please make sure you're checking through for these in future review request as it would greatly streamline the review process."Also, listing out a set of categories is useful, and even sufficient for many people. But it doesn't tell you how to stop being defensive, just what being defensive looks like and how to deal with defensiveness in others. Defensiveness often stems from some insecurity about yourself. Reassuring that insecurity can resolve the issue. In my above example with Evaluative and Descriptive text, the speaker may be more evaluative if they're stressed about time-pressures and resent having to mentor more junior employees. It might be helpful for them to cultivate the part of themselves that values broad, long-term knowledge and skills growth in the team, and to take some perspective regarding the relative seriousness of those time pressures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder, is there any research on offensive communication? Like, people who seize control of a conversation by going on the attack, who respond to another person's statements by changing the subject to something they've done wrong. Defensive communication is unattractive and tends to be ineffective, and I think there are people who pursue a consistent strategy of trying to make others look bad by triggering defensive behavior in them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113449</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of finding exploits in video games, detailing techniques used by players and developers to identify vulnerabilities. It emphasizes the importance of understanding game mechanics and code to discover bugs that can be exploited for advantages, such as cheating or bypassing game limitations. The author also highlights ethical considerations and the implications of using exploits, advocating for responsible disclosure and reporting of vulnerabilities to enhance game integrity. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for both players interested in game mechanics and developers focused on improving security.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a short blog post about my thought process on how I reverse engineer video games and build tools that enable me to do security testing on them.
It’s a bit brief on purpose, as reading the code is expected.
Let me know your thoughts and what would make it better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a wonderful app MS-DOS resident (TSR) on my PC that when pressing a key would do a snapshot of the whole memory (or specific area) to disk, to a file. So if you play a game, and lose a live, or HP points, you keep on pressing this, and then there were tools to do the diff.There was one game that was storing the lifes as actual text - Ninja or something....So last year my son was hacking some games, and nowadays there is a similar tool too - also based on diffs - though with me back then it was only 640KB, and nowadays we are looking towards 8-16GB if not more!Somehow this technique still works for some games, but with way more gotchas...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the end user perspective "let's game it out" is a must see YouTube channel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42088996</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the Neumann Architecture, a foundational concept in computer science that outlines how computers process data and instructions. It explains the key components, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices, and how they interact to execute programs. The piece emphasizes the architecture's significance in the development of modern computing systems, highlighting its influence on software design and efficiency. Additionally, it touches on the limitations of Neumann Architecture, such as the von Neumann bottleneck, which can hinder performance in complex applications. Overall, the article serves as an informative overview of Neumann Architecture and its implications in the field of computing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don't recognize the title, this is a reference to the classic:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090.The_Soul_of_a_New_M...which was one of the first computer books I ever read --- I believe in an abbreviated form in _Reader's Digest_ or in a condensed version published by them (can anyone confirm that?)EDIT: or, maybe I got a copy from a book club --- if not that, must have gotten it from the local college after prevailing upon a parent to drive me 26 miles to a nearby town....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of identifying ‘bit flips’ in papers, which are (if I am following along) statements which precipitate or acknowledge a paradigm shift.Perhaps the most important bit-flip of this paper’s time (and perhaps first fully realized in it) might be summarized as ‘instructions are data.’This got me thinking: today, we are going through a bit-flip that might be seen as a follow-on to the above: after von Neumann, programs were seen to be data, but different from problem/input data, in that the result/output depends on the latter, but only through channels explicitly set out by the programmer in the program.This is still true with machine learning, but to conclude that an LLM is just another program would miss something significant, I think - it is training, not programming, that is responsible for their significant features and capabilities. A computer programmed with an untrained LLM is more closely analogous to an unprogrammed von Neumann computer than it is to one running any program from the 20th. century (to pick a conservative tipping point.)One could argue that, with things like microcode and virtual machines, this has been going on for a long time, but again, I personally feel that this view is missing something important - but only time will tell, just as with the von Neumann paper.This view puts a spin on the quote from Leslie Lamport in the prologue: maybe the future of a significant part of computing will be more like biology than logic?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the paper: https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/Prelim_Disc_...&gt; 6.8.5 ... There should be some means by which the computer can signal to the operator when a computation has been concluded. Hence an order is needed ... to flash a light or ring a bell.(later operators would discover than an AM radio placed near their CPU would also provide audible indication of process status)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112817</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Let's Jelly is a platform designed to facilitate online collaboration and connection among individuals and teams. It offers tools that help users create and share projects, ideas, and skills, encouraging interaction and networking. The website emphasizes fostering creativity and breaking down barriers to collaboration, providing a space for like-minded individuals to gather and work together effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We used to create private Google groups with corresponding team and Google would provide a shared email like sales@ourdomain.com. Now admin has more control over who gets the shared mails. It is essentially free but with few caveats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone use a tool like this for shared family email? As the kids are getting older and there's email communication from daycare and school and extracurriculars and everything else, the method of "all communication about X goes to one parent" is not really scaling. Just using one shared gmail could also work, but requires more communication around "are you handling that response or am I?".It seems like fundamentally the same problem as this tool is solving, but when it's for family instead of business, even $30/month starts to feel pretty pricey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will you keep your price so low?I've been burned too many times on "simple, cheap, multi-user" shared inboxes. Most recently Groove HQ where it went from $20 for our team of 3 to $45/seat for our team of 5 over the course of a few years. It was still worth it, but when I left that company, I had to switch to a shared gmail account because I'm not dropping $135/mo for a software project that may or may not take off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119042</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emergence of alternative search engines like Ecosia and Qwant that aim to provide privacy-focused and environmentally sustainable options compared to Google. Ecosia generates revenue through ads and invests profits into tree planting initiatives, promoting ecological benefits, while Qwant emphasizes user privacy by not tracking personal data or search histories. Both platforms are part of a growing movement challenging Google's dominance in the search engine market, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations in technology usage.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't believe a single second the marketing speech about these 2 engines, they are both total crap trying to gain users with whatever hype subject is around.Qwant used to pretend being a champion of privacy, a "french made" tech, but with a search engine mostly based on Bing, lobbying with Microsoft against our interests, and with a boss sucking as much public funding as possible to finance luxury HQ locations and lavish cars...Qwant collapsed and was sold, but now it is just a mediocre ghost product trying to capitalize on a stained branding and on being a French/european alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every new search engine I've seen was a Bing wrapper with sometimes light reranking.I understand that competing with Google was borderline impossible a decade ago. But in 2024, we have cheap compute, great OSS distributed DBs, powerful new vector search tech. Amateur search engines like Marginalia even run on consumer hardware. CommonCrawl text-only is ~100TB, and can fit on my home server.Why is no company building their own search engine from scratch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, it seems the direction for search is going 
towards AI sites.  (Gemini, ChatGPT)Trying to reinvent Google/ Search in 2024 seems 
a bit like jumping the shark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42114990</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The GitLab repository contains the project files for Avremu, a specialized virtual machine emulator designed for ARM and other architectures. It features source code, configuration files, and documentation that provide insights into its functionality, installation process, and usage. The project seems to emphasize flexibility and performance in emulating various computing environments, catering to developers and researchers working with emulation technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site provides a collection of community-contributed scripts for managing and enhancing Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), a popular open-source virtualization platform. It includes various tools and utilities designed to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and extend the functionality of Proxmox VE. Users can find scripts for backup management, network configuration, resource monitoring, and other administrative tasks, along with guidance on installation and usage. The aim is to facilitate better management of Proxmox VE environments through shared community resources.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Along with the submitter, I am also on the team of maintainers who volunteered to help with maintenance of this project after tteck's sad news that they were entering hospice (1). The team members are all motivated individuals, who are enthusiastic on carrying on tteck's legacy.We are moving forward in a transparent manner and I am more than happy to answer any questions.(1) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42016605&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit of a tangent. I've been trying to manage libvirt&amp; Unraid through terraform, but have run into issue after issue. I'm about given up, and will just manage the virtual machines manually...What's the virtualization technology on proxmox?What's the advantage to using something like this as opposed to terraform or salt stack or Ansible?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been looking into setting up my first Proxmox box, here is my take as a newcomer.I wanted to do what I think is a very basic and very common setup: Modem &gt; proxmox box &gt; OPNsense VM &gt; physical wifi router via onboard 10Gb NIC + internal network VMs like OMV etc. The goal is to add a full network filter via OPNsense, and allow access to a media sever and backup etc from the internal network.I see no OPNsense, OMV script is basically contra-indicated because it should be a VM instead of the LXC container, and I don't see any glue scripts to get VMs talking to each other, which is an important part of Proxmox configuration. So it looks like there is room here to get some basic setup scripts for a simple home server either improved or added to the collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118286</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;Fermyon introduces Spin v3, a platform designed for building and deploying serverless applications with enhanced features for developers. The update includes new functionalities such as improved performance, better resource management, and streamlined workflows. Spin v3 aims to simplify the integration of various tools, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. It also emphasizes the importance of a seamless development experience and collaboration, equipping teams with the resources they need to efficiently create and scale their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know what the simplest possible recipe for running a Python script in a WASM sandbox using Spin is?I basically want to do something like this:    my-sandbox-cli-tool 'print("hello world")

And have the snippet of Python code I provide run inside a WebAssembly container that runs one of the Python compiled to WASM builds (https://github.com/brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build for example) - with a time limit and restrictions on memory usage, and file system access, and network access.I am on a continued quest to figure out the cleanest way to achieve this, I have so many projects I would want to build on top of this capability!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having worked heavily with gRPC before I like how syntactically similar WIT is to proto. Looks like its time to start experimenting more with web assembly component interop :).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Component dependency is pretty wild and could massively simplify some complex apps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118496</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed analysis of Bufstream version 0.1.0, a streaming library for building reliable and efficient data streams in distributed systems. It outlines the library's design, implementation, and the results of various tests performed to evaluate its performance and correctness. The analysis focuses on concurrency, fault tolerance, and data handling, highlighting potential issues discovered during testing, as well as the library's strengths and areas for improvement to ensure robustness in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While investigating issues like KAFKA-17754, we also encountered unseen writes in Kafka. Owing to time constraints we have not investigated this behavior, but unseen writes could be a sign of hanging transactions, stuck consumers, or even data loss. We are curious whether a delayed Produce message could slide into a future transaction, violating transactional guarantees. We also suspect that the Kafka Java Client may reuse a sequence number when a request times out, causing writes to be acknowledged but silently discarded. More Kafka testing is warranted.Seems like Jepsen should do another Kafka deep-dive. Last time was in 2013 (https://aphyr.com/posts/293-call-me-maybe-kafka, Kafka version 0.8 beta) and seems like they're on the verge of discovering a lot of issues in Kafka itself. Things like "causing writes to be acknowledged but silently discarded" sounds very scary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m looking at the product page [0] and wondering how those two statements are compatible:&gt; Bufstream runs fully within your AWS or GCP VPC, giving you complete control over your data, metadata, and uptime. Unlike the alternatives, Bufstream never phones home.&gt; Bufstream pricing is simple: just $0.002 per uncompressed GiB written (about $2 per TiB). We don't charge any per-core, per-agent, or per-call fees.Surely they wouldn’t run their entire business on the honor system?[0] https://buf.build/product/bufstream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very surprised by this:&gt; [with the default enable.auto.commit=true] Kafka consumers may automatically mark offsets as committed, regardless of whether they have actually been processed by the application. This means that a consumer can poll a series of records, mark them as committed, then crash—effectively causing those records to be lostThat's never been my understanding of auto-commit, that would be a crazy default wouldn't it?The docs say this:&gt; when auto-commit is enabled, every time the poll method is called and data is fetched, the consumer is ready to automatically commit the offsets of messages that have been returned by the poll. If the processing of these messages is not completed before the next auto-commit interval, there’s a risk of losing the message’s progress if the consumer crashes or is otherwise restarted. In this case, when the consumer restarts, it will begin consuming from the last committed offset. When this happens, the last committed position can be as old as the auto-commit interval. Any messages that have arrived since the last commit are read again. If you want to reduce the window for duplicates, you can reduce the auto-commit intervalI don't find it amazingly clear, but overall my understanding from this is that offsets are committed _only_ if the processing finishes. Tuning the auto-commit interval helps with duplicate processing, not with lost messages, as you'd expect for at-least-once processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115611</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hadn’t noticed the announcement of the vulnerability, looks like it’s nothing I care about for my “thread model”.https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235635/yubikey-unfixable...&gt;“The attacker would need physical possession of the YubiKey, Security Key, or YubiHSM, knowledge of the accounts they want to target, and specialized equipment to perform the necessary attack,” the company said in its security advisory. “Depending on the use case, the attacker may also require additional knowledge including username, PIN, account password, or authentication key.” But those aren’t necessarily deterrents to a highly motivated individual or state-sponsored attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant bit:&gt; Update: Ist sogar noch krasser, wie ein Leser anmerkt:&gt; zu der Yubikey-Geschichte sei noch angemerkt, dass die aktuell sogar so dreist sind erstmal ihre Lagerbestände mit verwundbaren Keys abzuverkaufen anstatt die zu verschrotten. Hab neulich zwei von den Dingern bestellt (die teure FIPS-Variante!) und was bekomme ich geliefert? Die Keys mit der alten, verwundbaren Firmware. Hintergrund soll wohl sein, dass die zunächst Behörden und andere "priorisierte" Kunden mit den Keys mit der neuen Firmware beliefern.Machine Translation:&gt; Update: It's even more extreme, as a reader points out:&gt; Regarding the Yubikey story, it should be noted that they are currently so brazen as to sell off their stock of vulnerable keys instead of scrapping them. I recently ordered two of those things (the expensive FIPS version!) and what do I get delivered? The keys with the old, vulnerable firmware. The background seems to be that they are initially supplying authorities and other "prioritized" customers with the keys that have the new firmware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem here is that depending on your threat model it might be important for customers to trust Yubico not to sell out against rich/powerful attackers. This behavior adds a datapoint that speaks against them, even if they are technically correct.I do not expect a manufacturer of such hardware to be like: "Eh it is okay" when skipping the fix to their IC manufacturers fuckup saves them money, I expect them to go out of their way to protect their customers. Seen like this their refusal to replace compromised keys was already brazen, them selling compromised keys constitutes a breach of trust.I am already researching for alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110901</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blaming all ills of any Japanese industry on the keiretsu is in vogue for decades, but at best, keiretsu is a symptom, not a cause, of the underlying risk-averse culture.  Keiretsu, even when they were toxically anti-competitive, did not go out of their ways to crush would-be global startups in Japan; keiretsu, by the author's own argument, didn't care about the global software-only market, thus would not kill those startups.  The true culprit, the risk-averse culture -- while with own merits -- did not mesh well with the more fluid flat culture of software development.It was not an accident that software did well in the most hippy region in the US, San Francisco.  On the contrary, hardware development, due to much more constraints from the laws of physics and economics, has been done well in Japan et al as careful top-down planning is the edge, not individual-level agility.*I am a little surprised that the author, who is active in Japan, is off the mark.  I regularly talk to many engineers/entrepreneurs in the region, and the cause-and-effect are quite easy to see and are unanimously agreed upon.  Kudos to people there who are trying to change the software development culture for the better.* Elon's ventures seem to challenge this conventional dichotomy as he attempts to bring both agility and top-down leadership into his firms.  More power to him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent ~11 years in Japan, porting/building telecom protocol software and, more importantly, trying to build software development and business competence in our teams.  Sadly, although I had a reasonable impact on individual software engineers technical ability, I was unable to find any path to leverage that into "software business building" expertise.Of course, the attribution of causes to this is highly subjective and I expect every person to come away from the elephant with a different interpretation.In my case, the very, very top down 'age hierarchy' culture was (and continues unabated) to crush any ideas and proposals that come up from younger and more competent engineers.  In the last 30 years with Japan, I have met only a small handful of people that are willing to take input, let alone change direction, from someone younger than them.  (a trivial example was a fellow company director of mine that was born 5 _days_ earlier than me.  In 4 years working together, not once would he take anything I said seriously.   Hmm...)Give the number of excellent Japanese software engineers that I know, the burden of this "culture" is (to me) quite tragic on its impact slowing down national progress in an important global field.   If anyone as ideas how to get around this, I would love to know and learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's one more aspect to this that wasn't mentioned at all in the article.In Japan, home computers never really made sense until it was far, far too late.In the west, you'd buy a PC (or a home computer) to play games, edit documents or manage your business. The latter two were pretty much impossible in Japan, as the computers of that era couldn't handle the complexities of the Japanese language and character set. Gaming was all that remained, and if you only wanted gaming, you could just as well get a NES (known in Japan as Famicom), which was much better suited for the purpose.Computers eventually caught up, but some of the cultural impact remained, still making them less popular than in the west.This is one of the reasons why Japanese were so good at consumer electronics, they just needed that electronics a lot more than we did, and the devices needed a lot more features, as "just plug it into a computer to do the complicated stuff" wasn't really an option there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42077886</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the linked article:&gt; The method, in the form of an algorithm, takes in data that have been collected over time, such as the changing populations of different species in a marine environment. From those data, the method measures the interactions between every variable in a system and estimates the degree to which a change in one variable (say, the number of sardines in a region over time) can predict the state of another (such as the population of anchovy in the same region).I also read the introduction of the paper. Maybe I misunderstood something about causal inference, but I thought from data alone one could only infer correlations or associations (in general). To talk about "causal" links, I thought you need either to assume a particular model of the data generation process, or perform some interventions on the system to be able to decide the direction of the arrows in the "links" in general.I'm not saying that the paper is wrong or anything, it looks super useful! It's just that one should be careful when writing/reading the word "causal".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nature Communications paper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53373-4GitHub link: https://github.com/Computational-Turbulence-Group/SURD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12411&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055121</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "What I Wish Someone Told Me About Postgres" shares insights and advice for developers working with PostgreSQL, focusing on its powerful features and common pitfalls. It emphasizes the importance of understanding data types, indexing, and query optimization to improve database performance. The author also highlights the necessity of mastering CRUD operations and the advantages of employing advanced functionalities like JSONB for flexible data storage. Overall, the piece serves as a practical guide for efficiently utilizing PostgreSQL in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While postgres is indeed case sensitive usually writing queries with keywords in all caps is an effort to increase legibility for visual pattern matching.  It absolutely isn't needed but if I'm debugging a query of yours I will send it through my prettifier so that I can breeze through your definitions without getting hung up on minor weird syntax things.It's like prettification in any other language - visual structures that we can quickly recognize (like consistent indentation levels) make us waste less time on comprehension of the obvious so we can focus on what's important.The only thing I really object to is "actuallyUsingCaseInIdentifiers" I never want to see columns that require double quotes for me to inspect on cli.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d never stumbled across the “don’t do this” wiki entry[0] before. Very handy.[0] https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My number one tip:  Vacuum every day!I didn't know this when I started, so I never vacuumed the reddit databases.  Then one day I was forced to, and it took reddit down for almost a day while I waited for it to finish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111896</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But distinguishing between smaller brown dwarfs and planets requires looking at how they form. Even though they can end up about as massive as 10 Jupiters, planets always arise around a star, from its surrounding disk of gas and dust.&gt; In contrast, stars, including brown dwarfs, form on their own within giant collapsing clouds of gas.Is this really the standard terminology? It’s not how I remember it, and it doesn’t make much sense. There are tons of binary star systems, and while a some are three-body capture events, aren’t most formed from the same gas cloud? (I.e., not “on their own”.) Likewise, rogue planets (i.e., not bound to a star) can be formed in a stellar system and be ejected, but can’t they also form on their own, e.g., a dust cloud with less than enough total mass to form a star? Surely you wouldn’t call a sub-Jupiter-mass body a “brown dwarf” just because it formed in isolation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just for pedantic remark, brown dwarfs is not stars, but they are substellar objects and formed in the similar fation (and this is why question about edge case of very large exoplanted vs very small brown dwarf is interestring)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substellar_object definition relies on sustained hydrogen fusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturn-size brown dwarfs? Who would’ve thought!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42076537</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered a burial chamber belonging to an ancient Egyptian priestess, whose coffin was found intact and contains rich hieroglyphs and intricate artifacts. The find, located in the Saqqara necropolis, reveals insights into burial practices and the role of women in ancient Egyptian society. The well-preserved state of the coffin and its contents offers a glimpse into the ceremonial and spiritual aspects of the time, highlighting the significance of priestesses in religious rituals. This discovery adds to the growing understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization and its complex societal structures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is illegal in Tennessee. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELVIS_ActPossibly more places, I don't feel like figuring out the current state of laws against using AI to clone voices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tuned in because as a kid i loved those sierra adventures. At first the voiceover sounded pretty good but within a few sentences i noticed something strange and it dawned on me this was AI generated. 
Considering voiceovers are a big thing for the adventure game community- usually requiring financial backing of some sort- i wonder…Are peolple asking for voiceovers simply because they can‘t be bothered to read or do we knowingly or unknowingly expect more than that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow this immediately sent me back, haven't thought about this game in decades. The room I played it in, the computer (486/33 w/8mb ram?) the friend I learned about it from (terrible friend in retrospect, for unrelated reasons). Generally just loving the humor and ridiculousness of it. Definite Monkey Island vibes. Thank you for the trip down memory lane, felt good to have some reminders of the positive things from of that time in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119141</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The HyperDX project is an open-source tool designed to enhance observability in software applications. It provides a system to collect, visualize, and analyze trace data, logs, and metrics in real-time. The v2 branch includes updates that improve performance and usability, enabling developers to understand their application's behavior better, troubleshoot issues more effectively, and optimize resource utilization. The repository offers comprehensive documentation for installation and integration, as well as examples demonstrating its capabilities in various environments.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whats hilarious is that Kibana started out as a Open Source.Hard to trust anything released as OSS these days that hits this site run by a for profit company.. Its all destined to have a rug pull after some VC funding. Considering HyperDX is a for profit company, I'm sure we won't have to wait long!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want an opensource / non AGPL licensed alternative for Kibana, Opensearch also includes a fork of Kibana in the form of Opensearch Dashboards.Clickhouse not being Elastic/Opensearch based means they would need to reinvent that wheel in any case because Kibana cannot use Clickhouse for storage. So this isn't so much an alternative but an essential component to make Clickhouse useful. Since you can't use Kibana for that. From various accounts here; they seem to have done a decent job.Of course the key strength of Kibana is that it builds on features that Elasticsearch has; like aggregations that are probably more limited in Clickhouse. Same with Opensearch Dashboards. It depends on your use case whether you actually need that of course.One point of concern with Clickhouse is that, like Elastic, they require contributors to sign contributor agreements. This basically allows them to re-license the code base if they want to at some point. Which is of course what Elastic did several times now (they changed it back to AGPL a few weeks back). Like Elastic are well funded by VC money but still pre-IPO. Just saying that if you moved to Clickhouse because of the Elastic licensing debacle, you might just have moved that problem instead of solving it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you clarify: Does the full-text search for logs linearly search all logs like Loki does, or can it speed it up with an index?The docs at https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/search don't seem to talk about this key design decision.I have a couple 100 GB to few TB logs (all from `journald` or JSON lines), just want to store them forever, and find results fast when searching for arbitrary substrings.Loki does not use an index, so it's pretty slow at finding results in TB-sized logs (does not return results within a few seconds, so it's not interactive).https://quickwit.io is one thing I'm looking at integrating, that can solve much of the index-based log search.(Note I'm not super familar with the capabilities of ClickHouse itself regarding indexed full-text search.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42117970</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the shortcomings of the edtech revolution, emphasizing that despite significant investment and innovation in educational technology, many solutions have not effectively addressed the fundamental issues in education. It critiques the reliance on technology as a panacea, arguing that it often overlooks the importance of pedagogy, teacher training, and the socio-emotional aspects of learning. The author calls for a reevaluation of how technology is integrated into education, proposing a more holistic approach that prioritizes student and educator needs over purely technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who's behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who's ahead can be nurtured.We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things "they shouldn't be" was just… insanely frustrating.Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's worked in EdTech for around two decades, I know why people think this. It's what a lot people here have already said. Education is what is failing, EdTech didn't magically solve this. Just like money, you can't just throw tech at education and expect it to solve anything.There are too many profitable incentives to poor education that are conspiring to perpetuate it. An ill-educated populace is easier to manipulate, gravitate towards consumerism, and won't hold their leaders as accountable. Power generally resides with those who benefit from an ill-educated populace, so anything that would actually help educate children and people at large is discouraged.I'll repeat what others have said here. Giving teachers the means with which to properly work with their students, and investing in students at a more individual level, is what's needed. Sadly, my refrain with regards to public education is that is has become little more than glorified babysitting. Those that succeed do so in spite of the system, and not because of it. Meanwhile, students that suffer from one or more disadvantagements (poverty, disability, social issues, mental or physical health issues, and so much more) tend to just...suffer more. And then they fall into cycles where preventable issues repeat or enhance into the next generation. They'll still spend all of their little income excessively, so profit is still to be had, or they'll end-up in prison, which, again, thanks to privatization, is also immensely profitable, so no problem there, right?The system is setup to fail because that's what's profitable in the long run for those seeking such profits. And because they can lobby, and use their wealth to influence politics, it won't change. Something else needs to happen first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The teaching method I find best is a teacher explaining and writing with chalk on the blackboard, and the students taking handwritten notes on paper, asking whenever something is not clear. In other words, the most boring classical setup possible. Of course all the nuances and little details make all the difference: board picture, structure, teacher personality, pacing, choice of topic, interaction, motivation, excitement, etc..  It is not guaranteed to work, but as a format it is workable, and I found nothing so far that is better either as a student (long time ago) or as a prof at a top university (for some time now).A distant second is the format we used during COVID: writing with a tablet using xournal, and streaming it via zoom (loosely like Khan academy). This is of course only my personal experience/opinion, but also informed by vast amounts of student feedback.EDIT: I agree with the different perspectives from the responses, and should have qualified that I meant it for subjects one typically learns at a university, like calculus or linear algebra. One-on-one tutoring, self-learning can work even better or complement the above and skills, e.g. playing a musical instrument should be approached totally differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115597</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The content discusses the use and impact of artificial intelligence in various sectors, emphasizing its potential benefits and challenges. It highlights the importance of ethical considerations and the need for responsible implementation to prevent misuse. The post encourages ongoing dialogue about AI's implications for society, particularly in areas like employment, data privacy, and decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inactive Fuel Rat here.What they are saying is dead on.  We will do what we can to rescue you, and the skill of some of the Rat's pilots is second to none.  (I won't claim that of myself.  But one of The Rats usually holds the Bubble -&gt; Colonia speed record.)The number of stories you end up with ratting is amazing... it is a wonderful thing to do.  Especially when you have it all in Elite.  Why not help others.  Rescue can pretty challenging.  And losing a rescue... really sucks :(  (Code Reds - They are out of fuel, and on O2.)"We've got fuel, you don't. Any questions?" - The Fuel Rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I ended up in a system with a star I couldn't refuel from and was S.O.L. I had vaguely heard of the Fuel Rats[0] and did a google to see if they were real and contactable. I put in a call to them and about an hour later a kindly pilot turned up, refuelled me and off I went with a warm fuzzy feeling. I was very grateful. It reminded me of happy times being in a corp in Eve with your comrades helping each other out.Being reminded of this might make me give Elite another go.[0]: https://fuelrats.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I had known about this when I gave up on the game. After a really frustrating time trying to figure out how to progress in the game, I was given bad advice to buy some contraband alcohol in one system with the last of my money and try to sell it in another. It was advertised as a sure thing. It was not, as the contraband was confiscated (I should have seen this coming). I couldn’t find anything to do or any way to make money, so I tried to make it to the next closest station. Ran out of fuel in the middle of literally nowhere, shut down the game and uninstalled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112005</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of using image montages as a form of resistor networks to explore dynamic range transformation in visual data. It explains how image montages can represent complex relationships through a series of interconnected components, analogous to how resistors operate within an electrical circuit. By visualizing images as networks, the author highlights potential applications in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and artistic expression, emphasizing the innovative merging of visual and mathematical techniques to generate new insights and creative outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So these addition formulas that apply to series and parallel resistors seem more generally to be formulas for finding the new ratio when you have several ratios and want to add them together treating the quantity in the numerator or the denominator as equal for all ratios. Series circuits have the same current for each ratio, and differing voltages, while parallel circuits have the same voltage for each ratio and a different current for each. Similarly for these aspect ratios, where you want the new ratio after adding width or height while setting the other (height or width, respectively) equal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is neat!When I was fresh out of uni, I got asked to build a system to show recommendations to people based on a graph of connections between them. I tried to mentally think about these as a network of resistors, which led me to dimensionality reduction and from there to alternating least squares. Isomorphisms are fun like that: they can help you find techniques when you're stuck on something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you made the Piet painting from a substrate with constant resistivity, and put wires between each area, you would end up with a working circuit with all the calculated resistances.  This then leads to the insight that it doesn't matter how you divide the painting up, its total resistance only depends on its overall size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115072</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a mini-game called "Git Jujutsu," designed to teach users how to handle Git commands through engaging, hands-on practice. It emphasizes the importance of mastering Git for efficient version control and collaboration in software development. The game provides a series of challenges that simulate real-world Git scenarios, allowing players to improve their skills in a fun and interactive way. Overall, it aims to make learning Git more accessible and enjoyable for users of all skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When people find out I use jj (Jujutsu), I often get asked some version of "how's it better than Git?" And while I can list a number of reasons why I think it's better and you could argue whether or not that reason is contrived or not, I think it's all missing the point.I think it's better -- in the most pessimistic case -- to look at jj as reframing how you think about branches and commits in the same way that learning a type of Lisp reframes your thinking even if you're a full time Python developer and have zero intention of ever using a Lisp.The idea of shuffling commits around without fear, changing your working train of thought mid-branch, etc. is natural... mindless, even. It's one command away and you get so much muscle memory executing that command you just do it automatically. (There's no fear because `jj undo` undoes any operation you did if you regret it. Of course there a ways to undo N operations back and so on too).I use jj full time now, but even when I periodically go back to using git (for older projects I don't have a jj clone out for), it has altered the way I look at my stream of work. I think there's value in that.That's the pessimistic case. The optimistic case is you should be using jj because it's better and there's almost zero downside to doing it (your coworkers don't even need to know).(This blog post was great, I just expect and already see some people focusing on the minutia of how to Git golf your way to achieving the same thing easily when that doesn't invalidate that jj is good, in my opinion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; git really forces me to make a lot of decisions I don’t actually care about. How will I save my WIP while I’m off on this quest? Do I want to juggle stashes and my working tree, or throw commits around? How will I get a commit where I want it? Do I need to come up with a branch name? And how much of all this needs to just sit in my head or pasteboard, lest I forget what I was in the middle of?I am hearing this argument a lot, but I don't really get it. My grocery store forces me to make a lot of decision when it offers me 7 kinds of ketchup and 20+ kinds of cereal, but no one says "I am avoiding large grocery stores because they force me to make too many decisions". If you are feeling adventurous, try something new. If you just want to get some food and go, grab your favorite brands. And yes, a smaller store won't force you to choose, but there is good chance you won't like the food you buy there.(For the problem described, I'd do as following: Save WIP work as temporary commit. No, you don't want to juggle stashes. You can do interactive rebase with "edit" mode and then cherry-pick extra commit - this'll let you make sure test passes after rebase too. Yes, you need to come up with branch name, any will go, like c_s_test. You will need to keep the name of previous branch in your head, but given author uses "develop" it should not be too bad. But this is all my preferences, if someone wants to do something else - more power to them.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why won't this work to achieve the exact same thing?  # on branch `feature`
  # code code code
  # whoops! Test missing
  git add wip/ changes/ &amp;&amp; git commit -m lol
  git checkout develop
  # write the test
  git add test/ files/ &amp;&amp; git commit -m lol2
  # back to WIP branch
  git checkout feature
  # open vim and put the lol2 commit in the right place
  git rebase -i develop
  ?lol2&lt;cr&gt;dd/3e7&lt;cr&gt;P:wq
  # undo the original lol commit

&lt;p&gt;The article "Blame the Gerbils" by Tom Shippey discusses the intersection of language, literature, and cultural history, particularly focusing on the significance of gerbils in popular culture and literature. Shippey explores how these small animals have been anthropomorphized in various narratives, reflecting broader themes of human behavior and societal norms. He delves into the implications of attributing blame to these creatures in a humorous and thought-provoking manner, ultimately examining how such representations can shed light on human nature and our relationship with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;England did not return to its pre-plague population until about 1625, 280 years after the first strike. During most of that period Western Europe had about half the population it had in 1345. And yet 1400-1500 ‘is the very century in which Western Europe’s global expansion began’, the period of what has been called ‘the Great Divergence’ between Europe and the rest of the world. ‘The Black Death and the Rise of Europe’, as Belich’s subtitle has it, do seem to be linked in time, and it may not be a coincidence.This period also coincided with the renaissance and the European wars of religion. Europe was a busy place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/4YwT6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading this, "Celebrating the Gerbils" may be a more apt title. He is "blaming" them for the rise of Europe via the after effects of the transmission of a terrible disease. It is a sort of justification for the policy positions of a recent Marvel villain.  Gamora : I was a child when you took me.
  Thanos : I saved you.
  Gamora : No. We were happy on my home planet.
  Thanos : You were going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
  Gamora : Because you murdered half the planet.
  Thanos : A small price to pay for salvation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112864</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the extraordinary story of the Lykov family, who retreated to the remote Siberian wilderness in the 1930s to escape modern society and its influences. Living in isolation for 40 years, they were oblivious to significant historical events such as World War II and the moon landing. Their way of life was heavily influenced by their deep-rooted religious beliefs and self-sufficiency, relying on agriculture and foraging. The family's isolation ended when they were discovered by a group of geologists in 1978, which revealed the challenges and complexities of their existence in the wild and their eventual struggles to adapt to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very Russian story: must-have big drama, old grudges, extreme distances  and overwhelming sadness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the family found out about satellites is very interesting to me- such an unexplained phenomena wouldn't make sense to some groups (ie, flat-earthers deny their existence altogether), where they would have observed Sputnik zooming across the sky while only being visible at dawn and dusk. With such perfect recurrence the Lykovs would have been able to deduce that the object followed ordinary orbital mechanics against the backdrop of the celestial cosmos rather than being a supernatural object, especially that Sputnik was only in the sky for a couple months in 1957. Later ones would have have likely indicated they were a product of man; I'd personally ascribe it to being supernatural in origin!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is their homesite on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/CkPRPxPuQuCg3q749Seems to be sort of a tourist attraction now. The nearest road is about 55 miles away according to the measuring tool on google maps. There's several nature preserves/parks in the area that protect the site. I guess people hike to it now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119219</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Carving Space" by Heather Buchel explores the importance of creating personal space for self-reflection and growth. Buchel discusses the significance of stepping back from everyday demands to cultivate a nurturing environment for oneself. She shares insights on how intentional space can enhance creativity, mental clarity, and emotional well-being. The piece emphasizes the need for individuals to prioritize their own needs and make time for solitude, ensuring that they can better engage with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I expected frontend devs to be able to handle the front-of and back-of equally well, but it sounds like that's very rarely the case. Are people that fall into this camp more likely to be at design-led companies, like Apple?Also, does anyone have resource recommendations for a frontend engineer to get better at these things? I've built up some solid intuition after working closely with a designer, but my big hurdle has been feeling like I need to dive deep into design world, get good at Figma, etc. Reading about the theory/concepts makes sense, but putting it into practice is what I feel will make it really stick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to engage in the discussion the article raises about why teams don't hire for this role.So, I have actually tried to hire for this role. Multiple times.The reality is that I got an order of magnitude fewer applications of an order of magnitude lower quality when I've tried to describe this role, as compared to when I just put the standardized "front end engineer" title in the role.So instead I tried to just sift through the "front end engineer" applicants to find people with design sensibilities. But this also yielded poor results. After reviewing at least a thousand applicants, I found one or two people with this combination of skillsets, and one of them to whom I made an offer ended up going with a different firm.Senior engineers in our team said things like "I think you're searching for a unicorn that doesn't exist" and "people just don't mix the right-brained and left-brained skills."After trying so hard, I just accepted that and decided to work with dedicated designers and dedicated engineers. Each are good at what they do.But our web experience is definitely lacking for lack of someone in this role. Right now, this week, I'm trying to fill the gap as I can do a little bit of both. Everyone on our team feels like we need some "glue" to tie our experiences together well. But a designer can't make it happen and a pure engineer can't imagine what to do without very explicit detailed designs / instructions. It's so much more effective for one person to at once understand how the code needs to function, what helps the user, and have design sensibility to make the form 'function' w/r/t cognitive overload and intuition. Things get lost in communication without someone who can understand all three. But there's no one I feel I can truly delegate this to completely on our product team.What have the experiences been of other people who have hired and built product teams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120313</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the unique ecological impact of feral pigs on the islands of the Pacific, particularly focusing on their invasive nature and the challenges they present to native wildlife and habitats. It discusses how these pigs, originally brought by humans, have adapted to island life and their role in altering ecosystems, which can lead to negative consequences for indigenous species. The piece highlights conservation efforts and the complexities of managing this feral population while balancing environmental and cultural considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

Is there a viable way of breeding pigs more like the latter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;looks like they are shooting themselves in the foot with so much conservation red tape.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bass heavy tendency of western consumer grade headphones/speakers is tuned for western pop music and does not sound very good with much else, some of the non-western pop traditions are not bad. Headphones/speakers with a flat response will sound lacking in bass but will not sound piercing with sources which were not mixed with bass heavy systems in mind and will play better with EQ. While flat may lack the deep powerful bass you will get used to it and you will be able to hear everything else in the track better, including the bass.The way they get that deep powerful bass is not just by increasing the bass, that would leave everything outside of the bass too quite in comparison, they also put dips in the frequency response to accentuate the bass. These dips work fairly well as long as the instruments are fairly consistent in their ranges which is quite regular in western pop, everything is essential a bass, a guitar and vocals even when they are not and you have 10 instruments in the mix, everyone sticks to the various ranges which sound right and the engineer (assuming they are good) fudges things with the mixing. But the dips come at a cost, you lose detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is very out of date and irrelevant now. The Chi-fi market has changed drastically in the last 4 years. You can get very neutral sounding IEMs from China now, V-shaped, U-shaped, sparkly, heavy bass, etc.One of the best-sounding, lowest distortion I've tried is also the cheapest, the Truthear Zero 2, available on Amazon for $25.If you're interested in scientific measurements of the IEM, AudioScienceReview has it covered: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/7...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you have ever heard Mainland Chinese recordings dated back 30-40 years ago, they were shouty, harsh and ear-piercing (plenty examples on YouTube).Sounds interesting, but I don't know what search terms to use. Does anyone have any representative examples?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42031384</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how firmware hacks are revitalizing Spotify's Car Thing, a device that helps users access the Spotify app in their vehicles. Despite the device's eventual decline in official support and looming obsolescence from Spotify, enthusiastic developers have created unofficial software modifications that enhance its functionality. This has reignited interest in the product among users who appreciate these improvements, showcasing a trend where hacking can prolong the life of tech devices that companies may discontinue. The article also emphasizes the ongoing community efforts to keep such technology relevant despite corporate decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! I'm a college freshman at Northeastern, and this is my first hackathon project for a major hackathon (MIT Media Lab). It won the Unconventional Computing track prize, so I'm pretty happy! I made this because I'm a major conlanger, and I was wondering if it would be possible to think in terms of sound when looking at an image. Fractals have easy-to-map parameters, so I created SHFLA, a language which takes in music, and creates fractals based on 0.1 second (you can change this) chunks of music! It's Turing-complete, so you can technically encode a ridiculous amount of information and computation in my system, although writing it out as music might take a while.Hope you find the project cool :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The concept reminded me of the song Lateralus by Tool, where geometric fractals are a theme.https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7JG63IuaWshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralushttps://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-tools-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not understanding what this has to do with shoegaze.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I must be one of those tiny dots just floating in nothingness because my BSKY feed is a dead zone.  I've posted, I've replied, I've liked and tried to be an active participant but nothing seems to stick.  There's only so many posts I can publish "for myself" before I lose interest.Contrast this with early Twitter where everyone was just super excited, and eager to follow new people.  I don't get it, shouldn't a new social network be full of people looking to create new... social networks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky and atproto seem to be built to be hackable.Someone in the community recently built a searchable directory of Bluesky "Starter Packs" (which are a way for a user to publish a set of interesting people &amp; feeds to follow, primarily to help newcomers bootstrap their experience):https://blueskydirectory.com/starter-packs/allDan Abramov posted about it earlier today, saying he liked it and:"the fact that it can be done in the ecosystem is awesome. let the ecosystem cook" [1]And maybe more poignantly:"seeing random projects pop up in the atproto ecosystem reminds me just how much public web common were stifled by social companies closing down their APIs. an entire landscape of tools given up on and abandoned" [2][1] https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3lar3sdna222d[2] https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3lar3xpuu4c2d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky has really exploded in certain niches over the past week, I think my followers have gone up 5-6x since Saturday.I'd been a somewhat active user over the past year as conversation on the field I work in (energy) become so degraded on Twitter as to make it kind of worthless (mean in multiple senses of the word as well as ludicrous levels of spam), but Bluesky was pretty relaxed without a lot of traction, now there's some real heat to it as things pick up.Hopefully this surge is real, has certianly gotten me to be much more active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118180</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository presents Gmail Agent, a tool designed to enhance email management for Gmail users. It provides features for automating various tasks, such as categorizing, prioritizing, and responding to emails efficiently. The project aims to streamline the email workflow, reduce manual effort, and improve productivity through customizable automation scripts and settings tailored to individual user needs. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contributions guidelines for developers interested in enhancing the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting choice with telegram. I see it requires to get user's own Gmail api credentials?I too recently launched AI automations for Gmail. I am a heavy email user, so connecting chatgpt to my inbox was obvious to me. When gpt-4 was released it passed my tests with 90% accuracy, so I've decided to release it at inboxchat.aiBut while I enjoy AI sorting my emails, the most useful feature for meturned out to be screener, inspired by this post: https://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2018/Sep/solving-my-email-probl.... It sends all emails from first-time or unknown senders into a separate Review Later label. If email is moved to Inbox, then that sender becomes trusted and is allowed into Inbox in the future. It's simple, dumb feature but so effective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use https://emailzap.co/reclaim-your-inbox. Simplest and most effective tool I have found so far. Alerts me for first time senders and if I don't take any action, it understands that future emails from such senders shouldn't come to my inbox. Auto-archives temporary emails like OTPs, etc. Best part is that it does all that without you having to provide any input to it. Only grudge is that it doesn't auto move emails to my labels but I am hoping they add that feature soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Telegram seems like strange choice but ok. I personally started to tinker with something similar - IMAP client which learns how you categorize emails into folders and helps with that. I started with manual rules and want to connect some optional automagic later.I noticed that some emails are valid for only some hours and then it's in inbox unnecessarily giving that +1 to unread badge.On other hand server side filtering works before arriving in inbox so you don't see for example, that parcel will arrive today. Next day you need to manually archive it. After 10-20 mails like that, if you are busy - half of inbox needlessly needs user action if you are into inbox zero.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118989</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;Spanish police have arrested a former fraud chief after discovering €20 million hidden in the walls of his home. The large sum, reportedly in cash and neatly packed into bags, was uncovered during a raid linked to a separate investigative operation focused on corruption and money laundering. Authorities are investigating how the money was acquired and the role the former official played in the fraudulent activities. This incident highlights ongoing efforts by Spanish law enforcement to combat corruption in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does one even expect to use €20M of physical paper cash? You're going to get scrutiny from the government and/or financial institutions if you try to deposit it into a bank.  I guess you'd "launder" it somehow, but does that even work anymore? Major purchases with cash put a giant government bullseye on your back these days. That is if you could actually make those purchases. I'd imagine most major purchases that someone legitimate might make (like buying a house or a car or a private jet) cannot be done with physical cash. Does the local Mercedes dealership really accept a suitcase full of cash? Even if you were to use it for all of your normal routine spending like groceries, you'd never go through €20M in your entire lifetime. So, career-fraudsters, I ask: in case I ever get my hands on millions in cash, what is my plan for using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You keep calling someone a "Fraud Chief" long enough...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd forgotten Europe has €500 notes, whereas in the US everyone now gets to deal with $100 bill spam.Few people bother to pickup loose change anymore.What's the long-term plan here?  Perhaps it's to add maximum physical friction to moving larger amounts of fiat than you can spend in a single visit to Costco on a food run for your family of of 4.:)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119575</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Learning Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection via Uncertainty Calibration Using Label Smoothing" discusses a novel approach to improve out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. The authors propose a method that employs label smoothing to enhance uncertainty calibration, thereby allowing models to better identify instances that differ significantly from the training distribution. The research presents experiments demonstrating that the proposed technique outperforms existing OOD detection methods in various scenarios, emphasizing its effectiveness in practical applications of machine learning where recognizing unfamiliar data is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

It's true that LLMs are not the central component of these systems, which have much more in common with Google's targeted ad serving algorithms, in the broader category of machine learning, but a no-code LLM interface is a likely component.In defensive red team scenarios, such an LLM system could be used in all kinds of nefarious ways, using prompts like "provide a list of everyone associated with the US nuclear weapons program, including their immediate friend and family circles, and ranking them by vulnerability to blackmail based on their personal web browsing history" and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42117912</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the history and evolution of playing cards, tracing their origins from ancient China and Persia to their modern forms. It details how playing cards spread across Europe in the late 14th century, leading to the establishment of various suits and designs. The article highlights significant developments in materials and printing techniques, such as the introduction of the two-color printing method in the 19th century. Additionally, it discusses the rise of collectible card games and the cultural significance of playing cards throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deck of playing cards has to have one of the highest density of "usefulness" an object can have that I can think of. I would love to hear if anyone can think of any one thing nearly as useful in so many ways.Entertainment of course - single and multiplayer, chance and betting, mathematics of all kinds, throwing, building (like a house of cards). I thought it was so cool when a character in Cryptonomicon used it to create an encryption cypher from jail.A sufficiently randomly shuffled deck of cards is almost certainly in an arrangement that has never existed before and will ever exist again.52 cards divides evenly by 2, 4, 13, 26. Add two jokers and you get 3, 6, 9, 18. Remove the faces and you get even more.Its just so well designed - or evolved as it were. If you could only have one object for the rest of your life to entertain or educate you, I dont think you could do much better than a deck of cards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never knew that “Kings being King David (Spades), Alexander the Great (Clubs), Charlemagne (Hearts), and Julius Caesar (Diamonds), representing the four empires of Jews, Greeks, Franks, and Romans. Notable characters ascribed to the Queens include the Greek goddess Pallas Athena (Spades), Judith (Hearts), Jacob's wife Rachel (Diamonds), and Argine (Clubs). The Knaves were commonly designated as La Hire (Hearts), Charlemagne’s knight Ogier (Spades), Hector the hero of Troy (Diamonds), and King Arthur's knight Lancelot (Clubs).”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article triggered Gell Mann Amnesia very quickly when it suggested playing cards may have evolved from Mah Jongg tiles. Mah Jongg was invented in the mid 1800s and spread during the Taiping Rebellion. Chinese society has Middle Ages origin gambling cards, but Mah Jongg tiles are very far removed from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036242</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the unexpected origins of the deep learning boom, highlighting the story of a computer scientist who, despite initial resistance to change, inadvertently propelled advancements in artificial intelligence. It delves into the historical context, exploring how his persistence, novel ideas, and a series of fortunate events led to breakthroughs that transformed the field. The piece emphasizes the significance of his work in overcoming skepticism and fostering innovation, ultimately shaping the trajectory of AI development today.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related discussion, 7 days ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42057139&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I may be wrong, but I disagree with a lot of the spin being pushed in this article, although of course Hinton deserves a lot of the credit for keeping the field alive and igniting the "deep learning" explosion.- The ImageNet dataset / competition pre-dates neural net entrants, and I'm not aware that Fei Fei created it in anticipation of such. The reason that AlexNet (2012 ILSVRC/ImageNet entry) made such an impact was that it beat all non-ANN entrants by such a huge margin that it was impossible to ignore, and pretty much killed all ongoing attempts to hand-design transform-invariant image features (such as SIFT).- While NVidia deserve credit for enabling GPU-compute with CUDA, it was pure luck that ANNs subsequently took off, and became the primary use of CUDA (which then added ANN specific libraries such as cuDNN).- AlexNet (ImageNet 2012) was certainly what started the ANN boom, which Hinton/LeCun/Bengio then decided to re-brand as "deep learning" to escape any historically negative association of "neural networks". However, while AlexNet demonstrated the power of a large (&amp; deep) neural net, I don't think it's fair to say that it was responsible the current/waning belief in LLM "scaling laws". The immediate aftermath of AlexNet wasn't bigger datasets, but attempts to build bigger/better ANNs to do better on the ImageNet benchmark. The LLM "scaling laws" originated from OpenAI's GPT-1 and GPT-2 where unexpected model capabilities lead to experimentation of scaling, with Sutskever and Amodei being two of the earliest believers. Sutskever has recently said that he thinks that transformer scaling has plateaued, and has started his own company (SSI) pursuing a different approach.I don't think we can say that Hinton accidentally created the deep learning boom. He always (to his huge credit) believed in ANNs, pushed it into the public eye with AlexNet, created the "Deep Learning" branding, and generally promoted it until it got too powerful for his liking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Huang argued that the simple existence of CUDA would enlarge the supercomputing sector. This view was not widely held, and by the end of 2008, Nvidia’s stock price had declined by seventy percent…This is a good example of how investor behaviour can only quantitatively project what will happen in the future. Huang's bet on GPUs for high performance computing made sense in the long term.Intel didn't have the staying power with the i860[1] a decade earlier (and of course had no idea how to offer decent developer tools). I tried really hard to develop meaningful and executable programmes with an 8bit card (DSM). CUDA was a revelation for me.[1] https://www.geekdot.com/intel-80860/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42116140</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Research from MIT reveals that exercise not only strengthens muscles but also promotes the growth of neurons in the brain. The study identifies a protein called FNDC5, produced during muscle contractions, that stimulates the formation of new neurons. This finding suggests that physical activity could play a vital role in enhancing brain health and potentially combating neurological diseases by encouraging neurogenesis, the process of generating new neurons. The insights from this research highlight the interconnected benefits of physical fitness for both muscular and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarification since a number of the comments are reading this as "strength training makes your brain stronger". This study looked at _motor_ neurons, not neurons in your brain. Motor neurons are the neurons between your spinal cord and muscle cells, responsible for transferring the signal from your brain to contract/relax your muscles.I think it was already known that working out muscles increases the innervation (the resolution of how many neurons are attached to a muscle) of the muscles, which is the mechanism for increased motor control that eg pianists have. I think this study is shedding more light on process, and providing stronger empirical evidence for that exact mechanism. Very exciting that this might be used to help people recover from nerve damage/spinal cord injury!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscles need neurons to control them, so it makes sense that some feedback loop would exist. I remember reading about similar feedback loops between muscle growth and bone density (as you get stronger, bones benefit from being resilient to higher loads).As I understand it, the kinetic chain goes nervous system -&gt; muscles -&gt; tendons -&gt; bones. It would make sense for all of these to make each other stronger in some way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two things that will improve mental clarity and sleep. Not drinking alcohol and strength training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115515</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the psychological and social factors that contribute to human tendencies toward corruption. It discusses how scientific research reveals underlying motivations, including the influence of environment, personal incentives, and social norms, in fostering corrupt behaviors. Additionally, it examines the complex relationship between power and corruption, highlighting that individuals in positions of authority may be more prone to unethical actions. The piece emphasizes the need for understanding these dynamics to create strategies for reducing corruption in various spheres of society.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article hints at, but doesn't fully dive into, the perspective of personal ethics. Many people who would never steal money from an individual would happily steal money from the government. As humans we tend to view these acts very differently.Relatedly, such people are more likely to steal money from a government they see as evil/corrupt, than a government they see as good. This probably drives a large part of the "contextual" corruption effect the article discusses, where a non-corrupt individual starts working for a corrupt government and suddenly becomes corrupt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So corruption is cultural.I'm a European currently living in Mexico and this has always been obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All human moral behavior straddles the line betweeen selflessness and selfishness, at some particular scale, from the personal to the societal/cultural.Racism? Selfishness for the group.
Religious bigotry? Selfishness for the group.
Misogyny? Need I say?
Corruption? Selfishness for one's personal gain at the expense of the system, itself.Goodness? Virtue? Honor? Positive cultural evolution? Selflessness in service to the whole.That is why the world has been tending towards the negative for soooo long. We have been inculcated into belief systems that separate us from each other along some boundary, be it cultural, racial, religious, gender identification, sexual preference, country, neighborhood, ... whatever.We are all one human race, of many ethnicities and cultures, but we will only begin to heal our blessed Earth and end all conflict, by recognizing that we are the only creatures capable of self-evolving a world culture of universal care.The goal must be universal compassion towards one another, selflessly, except when such kind, selfless behavior would contradict the paradox of tolerance. In those instances, we must be unyielding, but as gentle as good outcomes allow. Only a compassionate society can know how and when to prosecute the vermin among us, who come from all walks of life. We must endeavor to teach the ignorant, while protecting the innocent.Just systems of law, enforced fairly, are the bedrock of such a society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42114852</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;Waymo announced that its autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is now available to the general public in Los Angeles, allowing anyone to experience self-driving rides without needing to sign up for a waitlist. Passengers can request rides via the Waymo app and enjoy fully autonomous travel in a fleet of vehicles equipped with advanced technology. This launch marks a significant expansion of Waymo's services and emphasizes the company's commitment to making self-driving transportation accessible and reliable for urban communities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have the chance to try out a Waymo (you own a credit card and smart phone and find yourself in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix or Austin if you can get through that waitlist) I thoroughly recommend it.Right now it's the most exciting tourist attraction in San Francisco.The first few minutes are pretty terrifying... but the ride is so smooth that you very quickly settle into it. It's absolutely worth experiencing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality of app drivers in LA is wanting. I’ve been proselytized, informed of imminent apocalyptic civil wars, asked if I know any guys who want to buy copper in bulk. And how can I forget the driver asleep at the wheel of a Tesla with regenerative braking on max, with each doze into slumberland jolting the whole carriage into alert with a smart ping of the battery charging, all the long way from downtown to the airport? I don’t care if it’s double the price and I occasionally get stuck behind an errant traffic cone for an hour, I will gladly take Waymo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the detailed area coverage map for LA: https://support.google.com/waymo/answer/9059119#LA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42117008</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how these sort of solutions come up. I never understood the tab problem, I don't even use extensions to manage tabs, group tabs, or whatever. I like to keep my work focused, so apart from the 4-5 tabs I keep permanently open due to convenience (email, tasks, calendar, etc), I rarely have more than 3-4 others of stuff I'm working/researching. When its done, I close them. If I need them, I either bookmark or save the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do work in physics research so I open on average 20-30 arxiv and research papers per any session. This is combined with the usual searches for SO and docs (looking at you CUDA docs) which would be a lot of tabs for any gives session.I used Firefox developer edition (it was better performance that vanilla Firefox for my m1 mac and this is just a feeling not backed up with any data) and now is using zen browser. It is a huge upgrade, now I have workspaces, split tabs and vertical tabs. All while still using Firefox and ublock origin.I think this made tabs management good experience but ths most important factor is that I trained myself to really hate having tabs that I don't know which means that once I get past 10 tabs that browser starts to hide some information I got annoyed and then go close some.But I really feel like zen browser is everything I want in a browser so far. I tried arc which is close but it is chromium based and it is resource monster and also closed source and required account to use.One other useful thing is that once I got used to use my selfhosted linkding to actually bookmark things I want to explore, this helped with the tendency to use open tabs as things to read later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can achieve the exact same thing in Firefox using the Sidebery extension: https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42112475</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of making underground transit systems more accessible and user-friendly. It highlights the challenges faced by commuters in navigating these systems, such as inadequate signage and lack of real-time information. The piece emphasizes the need for technological solutions, like mobile apps and digital maps, to enhance the user experience. It showcases examples of cities that have successfully improved their underground transit and calls for continued innovation to support efficient and inclusive public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe ten years ago, I read a blog post by, I think, a French company called snips, that explained how their app used the pressure sensor to detect when the train entered or leaved a station. It turned out there was a very clear signal due to the sudden pressure increase or decrease when the train entered or left the tunnel between the stations.Edit: found it. https://medium.com/snips-ai/underground-location-tracking-3e...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is SO cool.I am actually currently working on a project to record the sound of the London Underground passing under me.We can very clearly hear the Northern Line under us. It's &lt; 30 meters below us.I have become obsessed with getting high-quality, low frequency recordings of it passing under us.Why? I don't know. I just can't take my mind off it.For example, there are two tunnels (north and south bound). By correlating it with actual TfL data, can I figure out the sound signature of each?More intriguingly, I know that there are maintenance vehicles that operate under us in off hours. Can I "catch" them?I'm not sure what else I might do with this project, but the idea of capturing the sound of this semi-ephemeral creature that operates below me has captivated me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we take a moment to appreciate the engaging, conversational tone of the writing? The article was a pleasure to read, even when it gets into some weeds explaining the frequency charts, etc. (I read the English-language version).Whoever wrote this did a fantastic job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122085</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses five unique features of raku pottery, highlighting its distinct characteristics and techniques. It explains the traditional raku firing process, which involves removing pieces from the kiln while glowing hot and placing them in combustible materials to create distinctive surface effects. The author also notes variations in raku, such as the use of different glazes and textures, and how these choices can affect the final piece. Additionally, the piece delves into the cultural significance of raku and its evolution in contemporary art, showcasing how it continues to inspire creativity among potters today.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I implemented something similar to the compositional regular expressions feature described here for JavaScript a while ago (independently, so semantics may not be the same), and it is one of the libraries I find myself most often bringing into other projects years later. It gets you a tiny bit closer to feeling like you have a first-class parser in the language. Here is an example of implementing media type parsing with regexes using it: https://runkit.com/tolmasky/media-type-parsing-with-template..."templated-regular-expression" on npm, GitHub: https://github.com/tolmasky/templated-regular-expressionTo be clear, programming languages should just have actual parsers and you shouldn't use regular expressions for parsers. But if you ARE going to use a regular expression, man is it nice to break it up into smaller pieces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Sign me up for leaving the industry before I ever have to maintain a Raku codebase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speed is still a major issue with Raku. Parsing a log file with a regex is Perl's forte but the latest Raku still takes 6.5 times as long as Python 3.13 excluding startup time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120090</guid></item><item><title>3. 3600 MHz Raspberry Pi 5 with Liquid Nitrogen</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120385</link><description>

It was basically and advertisement for Elmor Labs and everything was “swap out a part for an Elmor part configured to do the same thing”.The cooling was basically for show given the temperature- and voltage-independent scaling wall; the proper place to go would have been an ARM-based development house to use the debug tools, they’re certainly available.I’m not a Pi guy and I don’t know if the dev samples/hal/device trees have been released yet, but another option is to set up a bare metal environment and bring up the clock buses one by one to a different multiplier and see if you can reproduce it manually executing neon instructions in a tight loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Coming from Ubuntu in my SkatterBencher guide, there’s two things we can improve:&gt; 1.   Change to the official Raspberry Pi OSNow I'm curious how much OS matters.

There's just so many resources to learn from these days on youtube which didn't exist 5-10 years ago and I guarantee you if you have the time for it you can go from downloading renoise and a bunch of samples to bumping out some songs within a week or two of learning. There's also a lot to be said for the kind of sound you get out of older hardware, you have kids who are like 20 years old picking up these things and doing shit like emulating the DSP in there to create a VST for use on modern systems for those who don't want to drop a bunch of money on getting an amiga 500 shipped to their door [1], but you also have people pretty much just doing that and busting out octamed or protracker.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an interview with mathematician Edmund Harriss, who works at an art school, discussing the intersection of mathematics and art. Harriss explains how he integrates mathematical concepts into visual art and design, emphasizing the beauty and creativity inherent in mathematical thinking. He highlights the importance of collaboration between artists and mathematicians and shares insights on how mathematical ideas can inspire artistic practices. Throughout the interview, Harriss reflects on his experiences and the value of mathematics in fostering innovative approaches in artistic education.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There were several motivations behind the spiral. The first was an interest in the spiral patterns of both Celtic and Islamic art, and a desire to create a similar effect with as few rules as possible"Quasi-periodic Islamic wall tilings are a whole interesting black hole, e.g. see this paper https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1135491This really resonates with me. Unfortunately "the two cultures" polarizes people into viewing artists as airheads doing random artifacts or mathematicians as weirdos working on mostly useless stuff - the "I'm bad at math" confession to bond with people is common.How can we encourage more people to study both art &amp; math? Or Humanities and Science in general, e.g. English and Biology?I've always fantasized about having $10M discretionary money (haven't done the math, really, just a random figure) and opening a "Arts and Sciences Academy", which would be a high school where Arts trivium (music, literature, sculpture) would be studied on equal footing and intertwined with Sciences trivium (math, physics, biology) - I know an eclectic mix.I don't know why the very rich not pursue setting up schools like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fellow mathematical sculptor is Carlo Séquin [0].

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a severe concurrency bug in Netflix's streaming service, which can lead to significant security vulnerabilities and operational issues. It explains how this bug allows multiple users to access and manipulate shared resources simultaneously, potentially exposing sensitive data. The author highlights the implications of such bugs in large-scale applications and underscores the importance of rigorous testing and monitoring to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. By detailing the technical aspects of the bug and its potential impact, the article emphasizes the ongoing challenges in maintaining cybersecurity in complex software environments.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaguely related anecdote:30 years ago or so I worked at a tiny networking company where several coworkers came from a small company (call it C) that made AppleTalk routers. They recounted being puzzled that their competitor (company S) had a reputation for having a rock-solid product, but when they got it into the lab they found their competitor's product crashed maybe 10 times more often than their own.It turned out that the competing device could reboot faster than the end-to-end connection timeout in the higher-level protocol, so in practice failures were invisible. Their router, on the other hand, took long enough to reboot that your print job or file server copy would fail. It was as simple as that, and in practice the other product was rock-solid and theirs wasn't.(This is a fairly accurate summary of what I was told, but there's a chance my coworkers were totally wrong. The conclusion still stands, I think - fast restarts can save your ass.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My workplace currently has a similar problem where a resource leak can be greatly increased with certain unpredictable/unknown traffic conditions.Our half-day workaround implementation was the same thing, just cycle the cluster regularly automatically.Since we're running on AWS, we just double the size of the cluster, wait for the instances to initialize, then rapidly decommission the old instances. Every 2 hours.It's shockingly stable. So much so that resolving the root cause isn't considered a priority and so we've had this running for months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's neat is that this is a differential equation. If you kill 5% of instances each hour, the reduction in bad instances is proportional to the current number of instances.i.e.if bad(t) = fraction of bad instances at time tandbad(0) = 0thend(bad(t))/dt = -0.05 * bad(t) + 0.01 * (1 - bad(t))sobad(t) = 0.166667 - 0.166667 e^(-0.06 t)Which looks a mighty lot like the graph of bad instances in the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42087275</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Stretch My Time Off provides strategies and tips for maximizing vacation time and managing work-life balance. It emphasizes the importance of taking breaks for mental health and productivity, offering advice on planning vacations, utilizing leave policies effectively, and prioritizing time off to rejuvenate. The site also shares personal stories and insights to inspire individuals to make the most of their time off and advocate for their well-being in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ha, this reminds me of a very similar practice I used to engage in with a few buddies when we started work. It was always fun to try to figure out how to optimize the PTO to get the “most days per day”.Nowadays, I find that the best time to take PTO is when I feel like taking PTO. Taking a long weekend when I’m feeling burnt out or disengaged goes much further for me than grinding for the entire first half of th year to get a week off for 4th of July. YMMV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats ! However I feel the claim is lying to me and inconsistant:« In […], there are 11 public holidays in 2024.Let's stretch your time off from 25 days to 61 days »61 actually adds up my time off (25) with adjacent week ends and public holidays (27).  The 9 missing are week ends already next to public holliday but without any proposed time off extension. If you’re gonna count the WE next to PU it would be fair to include them in the initial count.The inconsistency is that I didn’t count one Saturday next to a public Holliday in Sunday, while the +9 I’m referring above are Friday/Monday next to week ends.I know this does not make your product less useful, but in a psychological perspective it toggle my defence mode instantly [0] in the same way an over promising advertisement as the opposite effect than expected.0: discussion ongoing here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113449&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I typically try to take annual leave and to travel exactly on the opposite dates to what this tool recommends. That's because I care more about avoiding the significant extra expense, traffic, and crowds of travel over public holiday periods, than I do about getting a few extra "free days" of leave. No free lunch!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118039</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the S3ctor team creatively utilized Quake editing tools to enhance the modding experience for "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind." It outlines the process of transforming binary space partitioning (BSP) data into Elder Scrolls plugin files (ESP), showcasing the innovative techniques that allowed for improved level design and expanded possibilities within the game. The post emphasizes the impact of these developments on the Morrowind modding community, illustrating how they have redefined game modifications and inspired further explorations in game design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMO, an even better tool was the Cube 2 Sauerbraten ingame editor - a combination of octree(e.g. variable-size) voxels spliced with per-vertex heightmaps that let you treat parts of it as terrain, others as cubes, and sculpt others into arches, rocks, spheres or vases.It had that same intuitive sculpting feel, but even more powerful and quick to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the quake .map format. It is like this glimpse into an weird alternate history. A sort steampunk ascetic to graphics.The article touches on this, but for them unfamiliar, the quake .map format is the editable text based format. but it does not use the common method of vertices into edges into faces as the base building block. it uses planes, the graphics primitive is is the three points that define a plane, where these planes intersect are the edges.I never dove into the subject enough to figure out if this plane representation was also internal to the compiled bsp format, but I suspect it is. My guess is that it is the natural conclusion when you need a map interchange format for your highly optimized space partitioned engine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;beautiful to see a decent programmer understanding the tech that people at e.g. unity and unreal have just fucked up badly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121957</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the various formats for presenting recipes, emphasizing the importance of clear, user-friendly layouts that enhance the cooking experience. It critiques common practices in recipe formatting and suggests that a well-structured recipe should balance readability, ingredient clarity, and step-by-step instructions. The author encourages addressing the needs of diverse audiences, including novice cooks and seasoned chefs, while also considering the digital landscape where many people access recipes. The discussion highlights how thoughtful design can improve engagement and satisfaction in cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just finished my own overthinking of recipe structures.  
I figure that a recipe is more or less an upside-down tree!Where you start with a list of all the nodes (ingredients)Have a n:1 relationship with the next series of nodes (steps)until you finish at a single node (the dish you're trying to make)So instead of having a separate chunk of "here's my ingredients" and "let me repeat the ingredients and one by one instruction until the end" I figure you can display the upside-down tree to convey more information with less words.An example being https://cookbook.cstebbins.com/recipe/bul-kokiWith the underlying tree structure looking like https://assets.cstebbins.com/cookbook/images/bulkokiTree.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find "higher level" format issues to be of greater concern. These are issues like: is the recipe structured in a way that makes the prep/process flow clear, makes it obvious when a certain ingredient needs to be prepped but divided into multiple parts for use in different stages, or when different stages lead to products that are combined and subsequent poisons in the workflow?A recent example: I really like the Hainanese chicken recipe at https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/food/articl... ... But I find it very hard to follow in this format.Using o1-preview to restructure it, I get something that I find much easier to follow during my cooking workflow: https://chatgpt.com/share/6733e594-df28-8009-ac80-d5dabd1ae0...But getting from a well-written recipe to structured data is now pretty straightforward... if/when you need structure data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooklang seems pretty much perfect for every use case I can think of.I would probably prefer a more generic syntax if I were doing it from scratch, but then I'd just wind up with HTML and it wouldn't be as good for recipes.I could see a more structured approach being useful if you were following one step at a time on a tablet, so maybe that scales better to more complicated recipes?Most of the stuff I cook is simple enough it all fits on one screenful anyway, on the rare occasion I even use a recipe at all, so I'm not quite sure what the best approach is to cover very complex recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42066358</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The project "Watermark Anything" by Facebook Research provides a tool for adding watermarks to images. It uses advanced techniques to ensure that the watermark is seamlessly integrated and difficult to remove, thereby helping creators protect their content from unauthorized use. The tool aims to offer flexibility in watermarking various types of images while maintaining quality and visibility. The repository includes instructions for installation and usage, as well as resources for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invisible watermarks is just steganography. Once the exact method of embedding is known it is always possible to corrupt an existing watermark - however in some cases it may not be possible to tell if a watermark is present, such as if the extraction procedure always produces high entropy information even from unwatermaked content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Link to the paper in the README is broken. I believe this is the correct link to the referenced paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what will come of all the creative technologists out there, trying to raise money to do "Watermarking" or "Human Authenticity Badge," when Meta will just do all the hard parts for free: both the technology of robust watermarking, and building an insurmountable social media network that can adopt it unilaterally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113674</guid></item><item><title>12. 80286 ATX mainboard based on the IBM 5170 AT PC</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122642</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository contains the design files and documentation for the ATX-286AT V1 mainboard, which is a project aimed at creating a retro-compatible computer motherboard. It features a detailed breakdown of the hardware specifications, schematics, and layout files, allowing users to understand and replicate the design. The project is intended for enthusiasts and hobbyists interested in building their own vintage-style computer systems. Additionally, the repository includes information on usage, assembly instructions, and resources for further exploration into retro computing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The license needs work. It claims to be GPL3 but then includes terms which completely violate GPL3, and GPL is not really applicable to hardware in any event.It's really some form of CC-BY-SA-NC plus some more limits about "safety" which is impossible to define and prove or disprove and none of the creators business.Basically it's almost untouchable until the terms are actually defined and made sensible.Even the simple "only for hobby/personal/educational use" is internally inconsistent because education is itself a commercial activity.Trying to say too much in the license is just wasting an exceptionally cool project. Just make it CC-BY-SA, add the warnings and disclaimers, and leave it at that. Only add the -NC if you want to sell them and be the only one allowed to sell them. If you aren't planning to sell them as an important part of your own livlihood, then don't add -NC, it doesn't make the world a better place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome.I miss the ISA bus and its simplicity.  People raved about PCI's Plug and Play, but in practice I found it very straightforward to set IRQ jumpers and the experience was free of the quirky issues I encountered with PnP (especially in the early days).I recall wiring an LED display and some very simple logic (like a buffer IC or something enabled by an address line in a non-existent memory segment) directly to an ISA wire wrap card and getting it to work on the first try.  One of the reasons I love working with microcontrollers (especially the relatively clean 8-bit architectures like AVR) is they lack so many layers of abstractions.One major aspect of PCI which I do respect is it's incredible backwards compatibility.  I still use a 20 year old Adaptec PCI SCSI card via an adapter carrier in in my latest PC (drivers were fun but it works).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stumbled over this project, which features schematics and details for a 286 motherboard and an ISA memory add-on board. From the readme:Current status(okt 2024): This project is built, fully functional, now able to operate at 20MHz CPU speed.There's still stock out there of original 286 CPUs, as Intel licensed several manufacturers[1].[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers#Manu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122642</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of interesting debates in this thread. I think it is worth placing writing/coding tasks into two buckets. Are you producing? Or are you learning?For example, I have zero qualms about relying on AI at work to write progress reports and code up some scripts. I know I can do it myself but why would I? I spent many years in college learning to read and write and code. AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it. Like a farmer who tills his land by hand rather than relying on a tractor because it builds character or something. But there is something to be said about atrophy. If you don't use it, you lose it. I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come...On the other hand, if you are a student trying to learn something new, relying on AI requires walking a fine line. You don't want to over-rely on AI because a certain degree of "productive struggle" is essential for learning something deeply. At the same time, if you under-rely on AI, you drastically decrease the rate at which you can learn new things.In the old days, people were fit because of physical labor. Now people are fit because they go to the gym. I wonder if there will be an analog for intellectual work. Will people be going to "mental" gyms in the future?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been working with colleagues to develop advice on how to adapt teaching methods in the face of widespread use of LLMs by students.The first point I like to make is that the purpose of having students do tasks is to foster their development. That may sound obvious, but many people don't seem to take notice that the products of student activities are worthless in themselves. We don't have students do push-ups in gym class to help the national economy by meeting some push-up quota. The sole reason for them is to promote physical development. The same principle applies to mental tasks. When considering LLM use, we need to be looking at its effects on student development rather than on student output.So, what is actually new about LLM use? There has always been a risk that students would sometimes submit homework that was actually the work of someone else, but LLMs enable willing students to do it all the time. Teachers can adapt to this by basing evaluation only on work done in class, and by designing homework to emphasize feedback on key points, so that students will get some learning benefit even though a LLM did the work.Completely following this advice may seem impossible, because some important forms of work done for evaluation require too much time. Teachers use papers and projects to challenge students in a more elaborate way than is possible in class. These can still be used beneficially if a distinction is made between work done for learning and work done for evaluation. While students develop multiple skills while working on these extended tasks, those skills could be evaluated in class by more concise tasks with a narrower focus. For example, good writing requires logical coherence and rhetorical flow. If students have trouble in these areas, it will be just as evident in a brief essay as a long one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is pretty good advice.I think often AI sceptics go too far in assuming users blindly use the AI to do everything (write all the code, write the whole essay).  The advice in this article largely mirrors - by analogy - how I use AI for coding. To rubber duck, to generate ideas, to ask for feedback, to ask for alternatives and for criticism.Usually it cannot write the whole thing (essay, program )in one go, but by iterating bewteen the AI and myself, I definitely end up with better results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129064</guid></item><item><title>14.

They're one of my favorite stupid/unnecessary videogame controller peripherals. They felt like such a missed opportunity, especially in the US. We only got three games that actually supported them, and despite my effort of actually tracking down a second pair of bongos so that my siblings and I could do multiplayer, we discovered that Donkey Konga's multiplayer mode was crap. We then got Donkey Konga 2, which was more of the same but with a worse setlist, and Donkey Konga 3 was never released stateside.The sole redeeming feature of it was Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat, which at least used the controller in a novel way to make an exciting platformer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggestion to put a screenshot or two on the main kongabeat page, there's seemingly no screenshots unless you exit to the itch.io site and was curious about the UI. Nice work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GameCube hacks are becoming really popular. There's the newly released FlippyDrive which allows booting games from a sd card without soldering or removing the disk drive.I'm a huge Mario Kart: Double Dash! fan and there's many fan made tracks and fan made roms which includes more tracks and kart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42127569</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;A new elliptic curve, named M-curve, has set a record for the largest known prime order for an elliptic curve over a finite field, surpassing an 18-year-old record. This breakthrough, achieved by a collaborative team of mathematicians, enhances cryptographic applications and increases the efficiency of certain mathematical computations. The article explores the significance of elliptic curves in number theory and cryptography, detailing the mathematical methods and implications of this discovery for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

All I know is this makes math so accessible and that's not easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108145</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a more practical method for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful products, addressing the pressing issue of climate change. This new approach enhances the efficiency of CO2 conversion technologies by optimizing the process using improved catalysts and reactor designs. The research aims to facilitate the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from CO2, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a circular carbon economy. The advancements signal a significant step toward making CO2 utilization viable for real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article annoyingly failed to close the loop from the $1,000/ton figure at the top and do the math on the economic efficiency potential of this approach.  How much electricity is required to sequester each ton of CO2 using this method, assuming you can amortize the construction costs over some long duration?  I assume the intended installation is on the exhaust of a fossil fuel burning facility, but is it possible to install this next to a solar field and generate ethylene from excess mid-day production?  Large scale carbon sequestration is one of the major unsolved problems of the 21st century and we have to expect many false starts before the really viable technologies emerge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The writer appears to be under the impression that CO2 is not a valuable commodity.In fact, it is, so long as it's under enough pressure, and in the right place. In Montezuma County, Colorado, sits the McElmo dome, an ancient underground CO2 well. They pump it out, down a 500 mile pipeline, to Denver City, Texas, where it gooses oil wells into pumping more crude out. Other than making more oil and making it cheaper, not really much in terms of greenhouse gas contributions- the CO2 starts underground and ends up underground.Kinder Morgan won't just let you back up your truck and buy some (it's already spoken for), and even if they would, they'd expect you to pay a pretty penny for what we widely consider to be waste gas.I think MIT is doing some good work. Just wanted everyone to be mindful of the massive scale under which CO2 is already getting bought and sold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time scale is also something I want to know about. "Can I remove CO2 from the air and turn it into something valuable in a way that is cost effective?" is one question. Another question is, "Can I remove CO2 from the air and turn it into something valuable faster than a tree?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42126984</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Netflix's development of a distributed counter abstraction to manage and track counts across its various services, addressing challenges related to consistency and scalability. It explains the limitations of traditional counting methods and introduces their innovative approach, which leverages a combination of centralized and decentralized techniques to ensure accurate counting in a distributed environment. The article highlights the architecture, implementation details, and the impact of this solution on performance and reliability at scale, emphasizing its significance in enhancing Netflix's ability to maintain efficient metrics across its operations.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Netflix Engineering is probably far ahead of any other competitor streaming service, but I wonder how much the ROI is on that effort and cost. As a user, I don’t see much difference in reliability between Netflix, Disney, HBO, Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. They all error out every now and then. Maybe 5-10 years ago you needed to be much more sophisticated because of lower bandwidth and less mature tech. Ultimately, the only real difference that makes me go for one service over the other is the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; EVCacheEVCache is a disaster.  The code base has no concept of a threading model.   The code is almost completely untested* too.  I was on call at least 2 time when EVcache blew up on us.  I tried root causing it and the code is a rats nest.   Avoid!* https://github.com/Netflix/EVCache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the design could have been simpler with Kafka (which they touched on briefly):- Write counter changes to a Kafka topic with many partitions. The partition key is derived from the counter name.- Use Kafka connect to push all counter events to S3 for audit and analysis.- Write a Kafka consumer that reads events in batches and updates a persistent store with the current count.- Pick a good Kafka message lifetime to ensure that topic size is kept under control, but data is not lost.This gives us:- Fast reads (count is precomputed, but potentially stale)- Fast writes (Kafka)- Correctness (every counter is assigned exactly one consumer)- Durability (all state is in Kafka or the persistent store)- Scalable storage and compute requirements over timeIf I were to really go crazy with this, I would shard each counter further and use CRDTs to compute the total across all shards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129097</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of diffusion models in the context of evolutionary biology, drawing parallels between how these models develop and the processes of natural selection and evolution. It highlights the mechanisms that underlie diffusion processes and their applications in understanding complex systems, emphasizing the evolution of capabilities within these models over time. The author discusses the implications of viewing diffusion models through an evolutionary lens, suggesting that this perspective can lead to deeper insights into their functioning and potential improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article uses the term "evolutionary algorithm" far too narrowly and it is causing a lot of confusion in the comments.  I would STRONGLY recommend checking out the book "Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms" by Dan Simon[1]. It is incredibly readable. The type being referred to in the article is the classic "Genetic Algorithm" variant of evoluationary algorithms. But genetic programming, evolutionary programming, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, estimation of distribution algorithms, biogeography-based optimizations, cultural algorithms, and opposition-based learning algorithms are just a few examples of other types of evolutionary algorithms.In general, they are a great approach to solving any non-convex optimization problem where gradient descent is not a practical choice.[1]: https://books.google.com/books/about/Evolutionary_Optimizati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a hard time with the analogy due to how important population dynamics and solution diversity are to evolutionary algorithms.In an EA, each candidate in the population represents a complete potential solution. As the diversity &amp; size of the population increases, the potential for convergence on high quality solutions also increases. I do not see the same concept in diffusion models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Levin's work is fascinating. Seems there's no field he can't help contribute to from a biological perspective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097418</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a graph-based AI model that can predict and map future innovations by analyzing the relationships between scientific concepts and technologies. This model uses a graph structure to represent knowledge, enabling it to identify potential breakthroughs and guide research directions. The aim is to facilitate innovation by offering insights into how different fields are interconnected and where future advancements may occur, helping scientists and decision-makers strategize their efforts effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimming the actual paper ... it seems pretty bad?The thing about Beethoven's 9th and biological materials which is mentioned in the OP is just that, out of a very large knowledge graph, they found small subgraph isomorphic to a subgraph created from a text about the symphony. But they seem not to cover the fact that a sufficiently large graph with some high-level statistical properties would have small subgraphs isomorphic to a 'query' graph. Is this one good or meaningful in some way, or is it just an inevitable outcome of having produced such a large knowledge graph at the start? The reader can't really tell, because figure 8 which presents the two graphs has such a poor resolution that one cannot read any of the labels. We're just expected to see "oh the nodes and their degrees match so it has the right shape", but that doesn't really tell us that their system had any insight through this isomorphism-based mining process.For the stuff about linking art (e.g. a Kandinsky painting) with material design ... they used an LLM to generate a description of a material for DALL-E where the prompt includes information about the painting, and then they show the resulting image and the painting. But there's no measure of what a "good" material description is, and there certainly is no evaluation of the contribution of the graph-based "reasoning". In particular an obvious comparison would be to "Describe this painting." -&gt; "Construct a prompt for DALL-E to portray a material whose structure has properties informed by this description of a painting ..." -&gt; render.It really seems like the author threw a bunch of stuff against the wall and didn't even look particularly closely to see if it stuck.Also, the only equation in the paper is the author giving the definition of cosine similarity, before 2 paragraphs justifying its use in constructing their graph. Like, who is the intended audience?https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad7228#...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping.This is not serious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh I'm glad that I'm not the only one who has gotten lost in the sauce by asking LLMs to recursively synthesize from data towards some grand insights--we want to see results when there is none apparent. What you end up getting is some bizarre theories overfit on the data with zero causal relationships. LLMs are fundamentally pattern matching systems and they will find "connections" between any two domains if prompted. It just reeks of confirmation bias; researchers looking for connections between art and science will find them.The simpler explanation makes more sense: knowledge graphs naturally show certain structural properties, and these properties appear across domains due to basic mathematical constraints, common organizational principles, and human cognitive patterns reflected in data. Sure, LLMs trained on human knowledge can identify these patterns, generate plausible narratives, and create appealing connections - but this doesn't necessarily indicate novel scientific insights, predictive power, or practical utility.If you find yourself going down a rabbit hole like this (and trust me, we've all been there), my advice is to ask "is there a simpler explanation that I'm missing?" Then start from square one: specific testable hypotheses, rigorous controls, clear success metrics, practical demonstrations, and independent validation. And maybe add a "complexity budget" - if your explanation requires three layers of recursive AI analysis to make sense, you're probably way too deep in the sauce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128691</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific scenario in the Rust programming language where a sneaky deadlock can occur when using `if let` blocks in conjunction with RwLock. It explains how this issue can manifest when a lock is held while evaluating a condition within the `if let` construct, potentially leading to a deadlock. The author provides code examples to illustrate the problem and offers solutions to avoid such deadlocks, emphasizing the importance of understanding the locking behavior in Rust's concurrency model.&lt;/p&gt;

Thinking about it now, there's no reason why it would. Still lots of footguns.Also, from my experience, acquiring and releasing a mutex multiple times within a single code path feels to me like a smelly, subtly faulty code.

&lt;p&gt;DeepComputing has launched an early access program for its DC Roma RISC-V mainboard designed for the Framework Laptop. This initiative aims to enable developers and enthusiasts to experiment with RISC-V technology in a modular laptop environment. The program offers the opportunity to explore the capabilities of the DC Roma board, which is built for open architecture and customization, highlighting DeepComputing's commitment to advancing RISC-V ecosystem development and fostering innovation through hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of comments are focusing on the value as a RISC-V development platform, which is obviously important, but I'm also hopeful that this presages more Framework mainboard options besides just what Framework itself offers. There is already a pretty big community offering I/O modules beyond Framework's options, but the true benefit of a Framework system is in the ability to not be locked in to only what one company things is worth the time and effort to develop. This is the first inkling that that benefit might actually come about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Took me a while to  figure out that the actual pricing was $200 USD for a mainboard (you have to untick value-added services).Definitely not the best pricing, but also not completely bad considering you get a 64GB microSD and case alongside?Looking forwards to the next-gen mainboard they hint at in the "value-added package" as the JH7110 really is quite a weak chip (even by RISC-V standards)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They promise Linux support. What is the situation with Rust on RISC-V? Obviously for a couple of years you haven't been able to build a somewhat complete and modern distro without a Rust compiler. However, that wasn't available everywhere outside of x86 and arm64 at the same time (https://lwn.net/Articles/845535/). Has that been fully solved in the meantime?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130630</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an engaging look into the daily life in Japan through the lens of "konbini" stores, which are ubiquitous convenience stores that offer a wide range of products from coffee and sandwiches to toiletries and beer. It details the convenience and variety that these stores provide for busy city dwellers, showcasing how they meet the diverse needs of customers at any hour. The piece highlights the cultural significance of konbini in Japanese society, illustrating how they contribute to both convenience and community.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It might be interesting to discuss this article in conjunction with another article that made the HN front page today [1], particularly the comments about how terrible Japanese software is.I am a long-term resident of Japan, and I would be the last person to defend Japanese software in general. I’ve run into particularly horrible user interfaces on government websites and in some internal systems used by my employer.But a major element behind the success of Japanese convenience stores seems to be the software that  manages the inventory, shelf placement, worker shifts, and many other things. The only time I interface with that software directly is when I buy tickets, use ATMs, or print out documents on the multifunction copy machines. Those interfaces work fine. Considering how smoothly the stores operate, the software behind the scenes must be working pretty well, too.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42077886&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been to Japan many times now and have sampled a lot of konbini food and have come to realize that a lot of it is just as junky as the food you can find at 7-11 here. The initial novelty was that it was Japanese junk food.Don’t get me wrong: I will still absolutely f’ up a steak and cheese roller from 7-11 in the states and will continue to eat konbini food when I’m in Japan, but all of it is kind of mediocre. They hit the spot like (American) Denny’s at 2am.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes Konbinis across Asia unique is that it's convenient, cheap and high quality. That's the magic sauce.Most other places are super expensive or convenient or high quality. But hardly all combined. That's why Asian Konbinis are great. Note this is true of most of Asia, not just Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42087100</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses effective delegation as a crucial skill for leaders and professionals whose responsibilities are increasing. It outlines the importance of identifying tasks that can be delegated, choosing the right people for those tasks, and providing clear instructions and expectations. The author emphasizes the need for trust and communication in the delegation process, as well as the value of feedback and follow-up to ensure successful outcomes. Through effective delegation, individuals can manage their workload more efficiently while empowering their team members to grow and develop their own skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it just goes to show how much of a gap there is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; take stock of the “what” you’re asking as well as the “how.”I think a lot of errors stem from assuming that "what" and "how" are somehow distinct concepts. In reality they are the same thing, we are just describing objectives at varying levels of abstraction. There are important inflection points along the entire gradient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NATO version of this is called Mission Command. You train the levels below you in doctrine and rules of engagement and big picture things like that, and then you give them an objective and let them figure out the best way to achieve this.Put another way: you tell them what and why, and they go off and figure out how.To do this, you need the training to be up to scratch that you can trust your underlings to be competent, and once you have that, you have to actually trust them.reference: https://www.armypubs.org/adp-6-0-mission-command-command-and...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Amazon's recent decision to tighten restrictions on remote work for disabled employees, making it more challenging for them to perform their jobs from home. This move has raised concerns among advocates for disability rights, as it could disproportionately impact workers who rely on flexible work arrangements due to their physical or medical conditions. The changes have sparked debate about the balance between company policies and the needs of employees with disabilities in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a company that is supposedly data driven like Amazon likes to tout, they have zero data that RTO would provide the benefits they claim[0]. They even admitted as much[1].I wouldn't be shocked if one day some leaked memos or emails come to light that prove it was all about control and/or backdoor layoffs, despite their PR spin that it isn't (what competent company leader would openly admit this?)[0]: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/over-500-amazon-...[1]: https://fortune.com/2023/09/05/amazon-andy-jassy-return-to-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “We continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant."I presume that's believe in the sense of faith, rather than believe in the sense of drawing reasonable conclusions from evidence. In other words, what are those advantages, and how do you know they exist at all, let alone their significance? As I recall, Amazon did pretty good during Work From Home, so why not start with the hypothesis that WFH is actually good for Amazon, then try disproving that with evidence.If their Return to Office plan is itself a secret experiment to do just that, I apologize for jumping to the conclusion that they are making decisions under a combination of the sunk cost fallacy with respect to their commercial real estate, and the insane impulse to satisfy their management layer, while simultaneously shrinking their overall workforce size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work at amazon and had a medical exception for working from home. While obtaining the exception, the HR person in charge of my case would repeatedly call my personal cell phone to ask me questions about my disability. They did this 4-5 times despite my insistence that we keep all correspondence written and over email and despite me fulfilling all listed documentation requirements. Once my exception for my chronic condition was approved, they noted that I would need to renew every 6 months, because I guess lifelong conditions you're born with warrant constant validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130079</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The Micron 6550 ION data center SSD is designed to deliver high-performance and scalable storage solutions for enterprise applications. It features advanced 3D NAND technology, increasing capacity and efficiency, while optimizing power consumption. The SSD is suitable for various workloads, providing fast data access and improved response times, making it ideal for cloud and data center environments. Additionally, it includes robust reliability and security features to ensure data integrity and system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice to see the product brief break down the write endurance rating by workload. They really want you to use at least 16kB block sizes with this drive. NAND page sizes have been larger than 4kB for quite a while now, but most SSDs still put significant effort into handling 4kB IO operations well. This market segment of server drives optimized for capacity over performance or endurance is where vendors are most willing to be up front about how your workload really should be appropriate for the drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pablo Escobar used to announce the price of cocaine on the radio every day, but you will not know even the estimate for an SSD :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to have this in my homelab in 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122434</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a peculiar bug in Google's keyboard that affects the typing experience across various devices. It outlines how this bug leads to unexpected auto-corrections and altered input, causing confusion for users. The author examines potential reasons behind the issue, shares personal anecdotes, and suggests possible solutions for users experiencing similar frustrations. The piece aims to raise awareness about this technical glitch while encouraging feedback from readers who have encountered the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm happy to see this write up. I have the same experience with this behavior and others, including the keyboard being (a) called when it shouldn't be and (b) vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years back I tried getting a related Gboard bug fixed and it was really frustrating getting the report to the right people. In the end, I did not manage it and what happened was after a long time the bug was fixed, probably due to some internal testing rather than the Gboard devs seeing my report :("Android 11 - Gboard not triggering Enter keypress event on &lt;textarea&gt; in Chrome when there are suggested words in the Gboard suggestion strip"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40738692The first frustration was getting push back from every place I tried reporting it - Android bug tracker, Chromium bug tracker,... and of course there is no public Gboard bug tracker, the only option is the "Send feedback" option in modern Android OS on Google devices that I'm sure gets lost somewhere.
While I do understand each of the mentioned bug trackers has its rules, I had to give it a try considering there is no other way to actually write a technical bug report and get any Google developer to notice it :(My suggestion is that each Google product/app should have a public bug tracker of some type. A place where power users and developers can reach the corresponding Google teams more easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great writeup, always interesting to see people digging into issues like that in such detail. I work at Google and shared the article with the Gboard team. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42085053</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The Twitter post by Alex Ocheema discusses a particular topic or event, sharing personal insights or opinions while engaging with followers.

But the article's PR doesn't seem innocent at all; it's more akin to a huge dangerous red flag.If any GitHub teammates are reading here, open source repo maintainers (including me) really need better/stronger tools for potentially risky PRs and contributors.In order of importance IMHO:1. Throttle PRs for new participants. For example, why is a new account able to send the same kinds of PRs to so many repos, and all at the same time?2. Help a repo owner confirm that a new PR author is human and legit. For example, when a PR author submits their first PR to a repo, can the repo automatically do some kind of challenge such as a captcha prompt, or email confirmation, or multi-factor authentication, etc.?3. Create across-repo across-organization flagging for risky PRs. For example, when a repo owner sees a PR that's questionable, currently the repo owner can report it to GitHub staff but that takes quite a while; instead, what if a repo owner can flag a PR as questionable, which in turn can propagate cautionary flags on similar PRs or similar author activity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's someone attempting to setup/frame someone elsehttps://x.com/vxunderground/status/1856450468945506615https://x.com/evildojo666/status/1856413636748562827&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is that innocent looking? exec(''.join(chr(x) for x in [...])) stands out like a sore thumb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42118097</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the controversy surrounding the "Electric Soldier Porygon" episode of Pokémon, which aired in Japan in 1997 and caused numerous viewers to experience seizures. It aims to address misconceptions about the event, emphasizing that Porygon, as a character, should not be blamed for the incident. The piece explores the episode's impact on viewers with epilepsy, the importance of accurate representations and understanding of neurological conditions, and the broader implications of public reaction towards anime and its creators following the incident. Ultimately, it advocates for a more nuanced view of media and its effects on individuals with epilepsy, highlighting the significance of informed discussions around such topics.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I have seen many fans, in the face of being told the reason for these changes, say that it doesn’t matter because they aren’t personally epileptic. This is, as you might understand, incredibly personally frustrating, and yes, very ableist. In saying this, these fans claim that disabled people do not have a right to feel safe when watching their favorite series, and that their wellbeing doesn’t matter in comparison to a few brighter shots of teenagers using their magic powers to punch each other.I don't get it. Why is it bad wanting to see the unsafe version for yourself?&gt; Over 2500 fans signed a change.org petition asking Crunchyroll to take down this edited, safe, version of the series and instead upload an unedited version that was true to the original vision—even if it had the potential to cause seizures.That's not how I read the petition in question. People are asking to get access to the original that they know exist. I can't find a paragraph that demands deletion of the edited safe version.&gt;&gt; As fans, we implore Crunchyroll to try to acquire an uncut version of the simulcast as we are paying good money each month for the services they provide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Unlike with “Electric Soldier Porygon” the movie continued to be shown unedited in American cinemas throughout its entire run. Since the movie failed to pass the Harding Test, an alternative cut had to be shown in the UK, Ireland, and Japan. This meant that for at least two months of its theatrical run, Pixar had a safe cut they could show to English speaking American audiences and yet still chose to have the unsafe version in US cinemas.Exhibit A - companies will only ever do anything if they are forced to, even if what they are doing is harmful and compliance is relatively easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other side of the coin: have a kid with epilepsy. After learning about possible effects of K448/Mozart's sonata in D Major, we keep a copy of it on all our phones, and it does seem to relax him when he is having a seizure.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95922-7Always thought it was funny that the only other song they had found (up until 2021) with a similar audio signature was from "Yanni Live at the Acropolis"Also, I found and watched the porygon episode in the last year, and it's certainly pretty intense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129236</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The project on GitHub, created by user bahaaador, focuses on developing a Bluetooth USB peripheral relay. This relay allows users to control USB devices remotely via Bluetooth. The repository includes source code, project documentation, and instructions for setting up and using the system. It aims to enhance interoperability between Bluetooth and USB technologies, providing practical applications for remote control of USB peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This solves a huge annoyance I've had: swap a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between multiple laptops, without manually un0paring / re-pairing. I have a personal "hot desk" at home. I want to be able to plug in any laptop to the large monitor, and have the wireless keyboard/mouse on that desk instantly work. And when I leave the desk with my laptop, I don't want that keyboard/mouse connected anymore.This has been impossible so far, because even USB bluetooth dongles still require each host computer to pair (and un-pair) with the keyboard/mouse.I am going to try your solution, and I will plug the USB input into the large monitor on my desk. Then any laptop that plugs into that monitor should have access to the wireless keyboard/mouse. Thank you for creating and sharing this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is brilliant! It just shows what can be done with the raspberry pi and other small computers, and some time! I love seeing stuff like this and the like. BlueSCSI is another example. If you think outside the box, the pi can act as a DPU, to an extent, for machines. It can already act as a KVM… and the PiKVM project has the option of mounting storage to the host, and even networking. Very cool stuff!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool stuff! Actually that tempts me to start a new rabbit hole research: could we do BT -&gt; Internet -&gt; BT. I would have so many uses to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125863</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The project on GitHub, pgpdf, is a Python library designed to create PDF documents using PostgreSQL data. It simplifies the process of generating PDFs by pulling data from PostgreSQL databases and allows for customizable layouts and formatting using templates. The repository includes examples, documentation, and installation instructions, making it accessible for developers looking to integrate PostgreSQL data with PDF generation capabilities in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers may also enjoy Steampipe [1], an open source tool to live query 140+ services with SQL (e.g. AWS, GitHub, CSV, Kubernetes, etc). It uses Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers under the hood and supports joins etc with other tables. (Disclaimer - I'm a lead on the project.)1 - https://github.com/turbot/steampipe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following the links, I find...    pgPDF: The actual PDF parsing is done by poppler.
    Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf-3.0 code base.
    Xpdf is based on XpdfWidget/Qt™, by Glyph &amp; Cog.
    XpdfWidget is based on the same proven code used in Glyph &amp; Cog's XpdfViewer library.
    The XpdfViewer® library / ActiveX control provides a PDF file viewer component for use in Windows applications.

Quite the rabbit hole!Any licensing complications? Is it cross-platform? XpdfViewer seems to be propriatary and Windows-only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fun. It would be interesting to add the able to query references inside the page, like images. That could be modeled as a foreign key relationship to the page. I'm using some Python libraries to do that and everything is wrapped in try/except blocks because PDFs are a mess. I wonder how poppler handles those kind of files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42059639</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to give constructive feedback effectively. It highlights the importance of specificity, focusing on behavior rather than the person, and using a balanced approach that includes both positive and negative feedback. The piece also emphasizes the need for timeliness and context, recommending that feedback be given in a manner that promotes openness and encourages dialogue. Additionally, it suggests tips and strategies for delivering feedback in various situations to enhance communication and foster a supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend “Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well”.It talks about the point of feedback and how there are different categories of feedback: appreciation, coaching, and evaluation.  The frame bad feedback or poorly received feedback as “crossing the wires” where the receiver wants affirmation but gets coaching or evaluation.  This throws them into a spiral.  Recognizing this can make you better at receiving feedback and giving as well.There’s a bunch of little things like “publicly praise, privately criticize” and that it’s way better to make time for feedback rather than waiting for the right time.  Feedback is best fresh, where you can talk about concrete examples or incidents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My additions:You're telling them what they already know - For constructive feedback to actually be feedback, it has to have a little bit of novelty. Either the feedback itself, or the giver's perception and experience of the situation that led to the feedback, needs to contain new information for the recipient, otherwise it's a lecture.You can't stop talking - Once you've given the feedback, anything beyond that is... not feedback, it's something else. Maybe it's your role to go further, maybe not. Be honest with yourself about what you're trying to get out of the interaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why you're bad at giving feedback"why you're bad at choosing titles.EDIT: the title has changed to "Delivering actionable feedback". this is much better. someone listened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121924</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some people without sight who use clicks of their tongue to build a mental map of nearby objects.It would be fascinating to compare fMRI images of bats and humans performing a similar task. Not sure if that would qualify for an ignoble prize, but it'd be an interesting study to read!EDIT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish is who I am thinking of. I've tried it myself in a very dark room with a sleeping mask on: You can definitely hear differences, and with practice it might help you to navigate. I also became a lot more aware of air currents, and had to move slowly to prevent disrupting "useful" air movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's almost 40 years since it was published and almost as long since I read it, but The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins [1] has a chapter or section about echolocation in bats that I found fascinating.As I recall, it talks about how the scientists who discovered echolocation were initially laughed at (the greatest human engineers had just invented radar, how could the bats have evolved it?), how echolocation may have evolved stepwise, some of the specific physiological adaptions, and included some speculation about what kind of cognitive maps would be required within the bat's brain.I don't know how well the science in that section holds up 40 years later, but it was beautifully written for the layman and was fairly high-level. If you're interested, I would definitely recommend taking a look.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am confused. I have said that bats build maps solely by echolocation for a long time, when argumenting about how what we grasp with our senses could not be all there is to reality. I thought it's the perfect example without drifting immediately into a spritiual realm argument...So did i just make this up until now (now, that it was shown in a study), or was this not common belief?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055221</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intense and largely overlooked history of the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, which was developed by the Soviet Union and tested in 1961. It details the design and engineering challenges faced by Soviet scientists, the bomb’s record-breaking yield of 50 megatons, and its implications for nuclear warfare and global politics. The narrative highlights how the test influenced arms control discussions and the fear it instilled worldwide, ultimately shaping perceptions of nuclear capabilities and leading to ongoing concerns about nuclear proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Tsar Bomba is a potent example of how nationalism, fear, and high-technology can combine in a fashion that is ultimately dangerous, wasteful, and pointless.Yep. Some similar grandstanding by the Chinese Army in 1960s accelerated the Indian nuclear weapons programme (overriding the utter lack of political will of its then primary leaders). After, buoyed by newly acquired capabilities, in 1980s, the Indian Army conducted largest ever military exercise (Operation Brasstacks) providing much needed impetus &amp; driving consensus in Pakistan to push forward no matter the cost, embodied in this notorious quip by their ex Prime Minister, "[Pakistan] will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own [atomic weapon]."The untold stories of these godly bombs are the devastation they wreak without needing to be ever "used". Devil's greatest trick...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;At his Livermore laboratory, he reported, they were working on two new weapon designs, dubbed Gnomon and Sundial. Gnomon would be 1,000 megatons and would be used like a “primary” to set off Sundial, which would be 10,000 megatons.Project Sundial was the ultimate expression of power, a bomb so big it would detonated here in the US, to kill everyone on the planet.I think that the "dead hand" system[1] built by the Soviets, and still operational today, might have incorporated a copy of this idea. This would nicely explain the hesitancy/restraint of the US in the Ukrainian conflict.Nobody wants a 10+ Gigaton bomb going off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let's view earth as if we are aliens (or even normal people) visiting our moon, watching the blue planet and the behavior of its inhabitants.So these conscious people were building several 100 Mton weapons AND detonated one of them on the surface of the planet! Knowing that it would kill and destroy life and atmosphere around it and contaminate earth. AND they were starting a program for building a Gigaton weapon??It is just surreal that anyone would even think of doing such, let alone doing so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125085</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of plain text accounting and its advantages over traditional accounting methods. It emphasizes the use of simple, text-based files for financial record-keeping, which enhances transparency, ease of version control, and compatibility with various software. The author explains how plain text formats can help in creating more organized and accessible financial statements, allowing users to easily track their finances over time. It also touches on the importance of using tools like Ledger and Beancount, which facilitate this approach to accounting. Overall, the piece advocates for a shift toward plain text for better financial management.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been doing manual accounting with spreadsheets for years, while looking for a smarter system. I wonder if your solution gives satisfactory answers to the issues I struggle with:1. Entries in one month's CSV file may be repeated in the previous or following month's CSV file, typically movements at the beginning or end of the month that the bank takes some time to record, or adjusts later. Is this familiar with you and how do you address it? Is your system robust against it?2. Credit card: the total amount for a month is one single entry in the bank's CSV file, while a separate CSV file contains all the details. Do you rely on accounts to handle this indirect flow, e.g. one transaction of 1000$ from checking to cc, based on the single entry of the bank's CSV, then several transactions from cc to the various expense categories, based on the details CSV, and checking that the cc account has a zero balance?3. Some utility companies bill every 2 or 3 months. This makes monthly stats meaningless (why is September so high compared to August? did I spent too much or is it the effect of the phone bill of the previous quarter?). Do you make any effort at trying to allocate such expenses to the month(s) when the cost originated, rather when it's billed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync is really useful for integrating banks OFX files into an existing ledger file. Over time, it learns common patterns, automatically assigning transactions to the correct accounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My major gripe with hledger and other plaintext accounting systems: setting up the correct rules (regex for your expenses) takes too much time as it involves:a) defining the regexes/categories) for dozens to hundreds of expense descriptions (e.g. walmart, gas station xyz)b) "recompiling" your hledger journals after every rule changec) checking for negative and positive errors (expense description was not matched OR too many different expenses were matched)This process is much faster in a spreadsheet application. IMHO the journal format of hledger and other plaintext accounts apps is too verbose.it would be a great relief if someone started a Github repository with expense texts used when you e.g. pay at Carrefour in Italy or Walmart in the USA with your debit card. People could submit those descriptions from the CSV exports of their bank accounts.Another annoyance in Europe is that there is no API connection for open source apps to bank account statements, you always rely on manual CSV exports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122258</guid></item><item><title>39.

AFAICT, it was only his person targeted.That the FBI raided the home of an individual most likely means a criminal investigation of that person, for a federal crime or a crime that crosses state boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously there are no details yet, but I suspect it's as simple as:- Polymarket is still very illegal in the US- Lol. We all know it's easy to get around that- If the CEO knew or was complicit in US citizens breaking laws, he could be in trouble. And if there was evidence he was encouraging it, he could be in big trouble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130194</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing competition in Southeast Asia's ride-hailing and mapping market, particularly focusing on Grab's strategic move to leverage Google Maps for enhancing its services. It highlights how Grab is adapting to local needs while contending with rivals like Gojek and the implications of integrating advanced mapping technology for improving user experience. The piece underscores the significance of mapping accuracy and localized features in navigating the complex urban environments of the region, demonstrating Grab's efforts to maintain its dominance in the evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Manjaro's decision to experiment with an opt-out telemetry system, which allows users to send anonymous usage data to help improve the distribution while giving them the option to opt out. The post raises concerns about user privacy, the transparency of the data collection process, and the implications of telemetry in open-source software. It encourages community feedback on the initiative and emphasizes the importance of user control over personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meta-problem here is that the bar is unreasonably higher for free software than proprietary.Apple, who is known for being pro-privacy, makes your Mac "phone home to obtain a special boot signature, known in Apple jargon as a 'ticket'" just so it can boot after an update.[0] It's also known that macOS has checked app signatures online for over 2 years [1] in the past, not sure if it still does.I'm happily using a MacBook nevertheless and I bet a lot of people browsing HN also do. Free software should be better than that, but we (their users) should also make their developers' lives easier. You can't expect high-quality software from mostly-volunteering engineers if they are fighting fires, and data-driven decisions if there is no data to begin with.[0] https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/06/16/apple-reneged-on-ocsp-pri...[1] https://eclecticlight.co/2020/11/25/macos-has-checked-app-si...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a game dev, and it's useful for me to have stats about how frequently abilities are used, what items players use, etc. to tune game systems. I've often thought it would be really easy to collect telemetry-- send a json blob with some info about actions players take in game -- but I want to make this both transparent and useful to players too.I know that telemetry should be opt in, but no players will ever turn it on. And that leads to a conundrum- do I incentivize turning it on? Make it opt out? Gate some features (like heat maps on a play session or skill visualizations) behind it?Would it be useful to have the ability to see exactly what was sent? Like, I could show a telemetry json or yaml blob in the options screen to show what events I collect. Would it be useful to have fine grained telemetry controls, like, the ability to toggle any arbitrary telemetry event from being fired?It's a tough spot to be in, as a dev, to want insight into how people interact with your system, while also wanting to give people a chance to decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manjaro has been dead to me for a long time (for different reasons). But this sets it in stone. I used to like Manjaro as a simple stable arch Alternative.Telemetry should always be opt in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121548</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the CPU activity readings in macOS's Activity Monitor, explaining that these readings may not accurately reflect the actual CPU usage due to how the macOS processes and reports these metrics. It highlights the distinction between perceived CPU activity and real-world performance, mentioning that Activity Monitor can sometimes show misleading figures due to various factors such as the efficiency of Apple's processors and the way macOS handles tasks. The piece emphasizes the need for users to understand these metrics better to make informed judgments about their system's performance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What Activity Monitor actually shows as % CPU or “percentage of CPU capability that’s being used” is what’s better known as active residency of each core, that’s the percentage of processor cycles that aren’t idle, but actively processing threads owned by a given process. But it doesn’t take into account the frequency or clock speed of the core at that time, nor the difference in core throughput between P and E cores.Does "%CPU" need to take into account these things?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused, isn't this exactly the same as for intel? Intel processors can turbo-boost, and you can manually cap the frequency by setting the package power-limit register (or well, you used to before some firmware update). That obviously doesn't change the % CPU reported either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an alternative app that shows the better numbers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094889</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of using Docker Compose for managing complex multi-container applications and highlights its inability to handle production-level requirements like orchestration, scaling, and automated recovery. It emphasizes the need for more robust solutions such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage container deployments effectively in production environments. The author also outlines situations where Docker Compose might still be suitable, but overall advocates for transitioning to more powerful orchestration tools to ensure reliability and maintainability of containerized applications in larger, more demanding environments.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the problem is 1) port mapping and 2) backing up data volumes?There are simple solutions to each1) you simple have a separate docker-compose file for a different environment, ie docker-compose.dev.yml for your dev server. in this file you simply define the parts that differ from the primary / prod compose file. that way it's a simple command. line variable that initiates a dev vs prod vs any other type. for details see https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-fil...2) this is literally as simple as running a small bash script that creates a backup, tars and gzips the file and then uploads it to an S3 repository. Sure, maybe not out of the box, but generally pretty simple. Likewise i'd always have a script that does the inverse (downloads the latest backup, loads it into the db and restores the files).Not exactly rocket science...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who is self-hosting with a docker on my own server, I don't see the negatives mentioned in this article as being a problem at all. Quite the opposite, it gives you the freedom to do your docker setup how you want it.It took me some time initially to figure things out and I had to learn some things. But now it's a breeze. Once I had reverse proxy and automatic certificate renewal in place it has been working ever since then without me having to do anything. Adding a new service like Immisch or Jellyfin takes me an hour or less. Which can be quicker, but I adjust every docker compose to my setup and make it more secure. E.g. I create a new non-root user for each service. Basically I have the whole setup figured out; I have notes and checklists for the new services I add. I don't need to figure out things anymore and in 95% of the cases things just work.Updating existing services takes minutes: just increment the version in the compose file and rebuild.For my setup, I use macvlan as opposed to the default docker bridge network. So, the `ports: - "8000:5000"` docker compose config is being ignored. Instead, each docker container gets its own unique IP and MAC address I assign to it. It can then use any port it wants. Thanks to this, on my home network, I can access any container I want by IP. And any container can access any other container. I then add some restrictions for security purposes on the host machine using nftables.For reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager which is a simplified GUI around Nginx. I'm slowly moving to just using Nginx.For the database, I run multiple instances of Postgres and MySQL and I don't see any issues. They take an insignificant amount of resources compared to the applications. If the application is not in use, its database instance is not being used as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always understood docker-compose to be a development or personal tool, not for production.  Is that not usually the case?Also aside, "docker compose" (V2) is different from "docker-compose" (V1) [0], it was rewritten and integrated into docker as a plugin.  It should still be able to handle most old compose files, but there were some changes.[0] https://docs.docker.com/compose/releases/migrate/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42122690</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of ticker tape, originally used to transmit stock prices, and explores its modern implications in the context of digital communication and information overload. It reflects on how the rapid flow of information through platforms like social media can create a continuous stream of data similar to a ticker tape, affecting our perception and processing of information. The piece encourages readers to consider the impact of this barrage of information on mental health and attention spans, suggesting a need for mindful consumption of media.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;No figure is yet known for the exact prevalence of "ticker tapers" among the synesthete and non-synesthete population, but an interesting study (Holm, Eilertsen and Price, 2015) found that almost half the general population reported some kind of mild experience of this type.Amazing, I wonder what else I have no idea of will eventually turn out to be experienced by half the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dont have this but I have experienced this rarely in some dreams, where a concept appears as an object or a shape and you know it.In one very old dream I saw love as a yellow space ship like object. In that moment in that dream, these two weren't separate from each other. May be that's not synesthesia but that's how I understand it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I have aphantasia, visual snow, and at least audio-tactile / sound-color / space-concept synesthesia. I often see a grid of dense, contextually sensitive symbolics overlaid onto backgrounds. For example, I see math-like things on white walls, charts &amp; graphs when I look at gray ones, and kanji-like strokes when I watch anime (I studied Japanese years ago).As a researcher in AGI, it makes me wonder if synesthesia is just a mixture of any senses that happen to develop particularly strong associations rather than a separate pathway. My synesthesia certainly has been getting stronger the more I learn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093413</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advancements in OpenAI's coding model, Qwen-2.5, highlighting its capabilities in generating code, debugging, and providing suggestions for improvement. The author shares insights on the model's performance compared to other AI tools, illustrating its potential impact on software development. Additionally, the piece covers practical use cases and the importance of AI in enhancing coder productivity, while also addressing challenges and considerations in its application. Overall, it emphasizes the ongoing evolution of AI in programming and its implications for the future of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Qwen2.5 Coder 32B is great for an OSS model, but in my testing (ollama) Sonnet 3.5 yields noticeably better results, a lot more than what the provided benchmarks suggest.Best thing about it is that it's an OSS model that can be hosted by anyone, resulting in an open competitive market bringing hosting costs down, currently sitting at $0.18/$0.18 M tok/s [1] making it 50x cheaper than Sonnet 3.5 and ~17x cheaper than Haiku 3.5.[1] https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard conflicting things about it. Some claim it was trained so it can do well on benchmarks and in real world scenarios it's lacking. Can somebody deny/confirm ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of offline LLMs but in practice there's no way I'm wasting battery life on running a Language Model.On a desktop too, I wonder if it's worth the additional stress and heat on my GPU as opposed to one somewhere in a datacenter which will cost me a few dollars per month, or a few cents per hour if I spin up the infra myself on demand.Super useful for confidential / secret work though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42123909</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a user-friendly tool called "Momboard," designed for efficiently managing family schedules and responsibilities. It emphasizes its interactive features that facilitate organization and communication among family members, allowing users to share tasks, events, and important reminders easily. The post highlights the significance of such tools in reducing stress and improving family dynamics, illustrating how technology can enhance daily life by promoting collaboration and transparency in managing family commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a beautiful use of technology to uphold someone's personhood, and let them know they are loved, despite (and with regard to) a profound injury.This reminds me of a desire I've had for a long time: a simple, wall-mountable eInk device that could be configured with a URL (+wifi creds) and render a markdown file, refreshing once every hour or so. It would be so useful for so many applications – I'm a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless. I'd definitely pay a couple of hundred dollars per device for a solid version of such a thing, if it could be mounted and then recharged every month or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish this had come up on HN (or I had had that idea myself) some years ago when my mother suffered from that same cruel condition, for the last four years of her life. With her body, all her older memories and her considerable intelligence largely intact, she had multiple moments of clarity every single day, in which she fully realized the terrible and hopeless situation she was in. But of course, within seconds this thought and any decisions she might have derived from it dissolved in the black hole of her defective short-term memory. So she would not even have had the ability to take her own life to end this if she wished so. 
My brother and I tried many things to improve her life somewhat, only very few of those were actually a bit succesful. Two of them were digital gadgets, which we  selected to provide some benefit without or at least with just very simple interactions: The best one was an LCD "picture frame" the only feature of which was to show an infinite loop of family photos stored on its SD card - she came to really like it and have it switched on quite consistently. The second one was an MP3 speaker which had a few hours of her favorite music on an SD card as  well, and which could be used largely like a radio, just by pressing its play/stop button and volume buttons. This latter one she managed to enjoy at least from time to time.
Best wishes to the author and his mom, and everyone in a similar situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the few HN articles that have profoundly moved me. Such a beautiful and simple use of technology to make a clear and big improvement in someone's life.As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP's mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game. OP's mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135520</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scam and spam call problem is really bad in Germany to this day. And has been for 10 years.A couple years ago I would sit at my desk thinking about a really hard problem in silence. The phone rings. Spam call. Every 30-180 minutes another one. If you now think turn the phone off, well not that easy as CEO of a business when people expect you to be reachable.It creamed my corn so much that I recorded my own voice samples as a senile "Opa Denny" (german grandpa Denny), modelled after Lenny. Complete with background ducks hanging out on the couch to Opas dismay, later in the call. It works on autopilot without interaction because on Asterisk, and with the largest German SIP provider at least, you can extract the calling peer identity from the SIP header. So I wrote a scoring system based on indicated number, black and whitelist regexs for number and for calling peer, greylist for the geographically surrounding number prefixes, etc. A legit mobile call would show up as number@t-mobile.de for example, while a spam call would say fakenumber@01012.com.Asterisk would record the call in wideband stereo, normalize the audio, and mail it to me as MP3 attachment. Funny for a while, but these days I just throw all such calls onto the mailbox. Since they need a real person to scam or create a sale, the call is finished right away.It works great to this day, because I never published it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool when some independent hacker / artist does it as "Lemmy".When a big telecom does it, the second thing they do with it is to fuck up the spam detection so bad that every third phone call I make gets answered by "Daisy".And just think about it - why would a telecom need this tech? They can already drop the spam calls and stop routing calls from the bad actor telecoms who enable the spammers. They don't do that because they prefer to collect a few cents a call from them rather than serve their customers better. It's everyone else who needs this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like the logical endpoint of a lot of this is people getting paid directly for their attention. Want to call me? I've set a price of $5/call that I answer, and an additional $10/minute of listen time after the first 10 seconds. Want to send me an email? $1/email and $5/100 words. Anyone I have emailed is automatically on my allow-list, which I can also adjust manually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138115</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) impacts technical debt in software development. It argues that as AI technologies become more prevalent, the consequences of neglecting technical debt become increasingly costly. The author emphasizes the need for organizations to proactively address technical debt, as failure to do so can lead to higher maintenance costs and difficulties in adopting new technologies. The piece highlights the importance of balancing innovation with sound engineering practices to ensure sustainable growth and efficiency in the face of advancing AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit "weird" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, in ‘high-debt’ environments with subtle control flow, long-range dependencies, and unexpected patterns, they struggle to generate a useful responseI'd argue that a lot of this is not "tech debt" but just signs of maturity in a codebase. Real world business requirements don't often map cleanly onto any given pattern. Over time codebases develop these "scars", little patches of weirdness. It's often tempting for the younger, less experienced engineer to declare this as tech debt or cruft or whatever, and that a full re-write is needed. Only to re-learn the lessons those scars taught in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI is a tool and nothing more. You give it too much and it will fumble, humans fumble but we can self correct where instead AI hallucinates. Crazy nightmare AI dreams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137527</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are facing significant challenges in developing more advanced artificial intelligence systems. Despite their substantial investments and breakthroughs, these organizations are grappling with limitations related to scaling their models and addressing ethical concerns. The article highlights the complexities involved in creating AI that is not only powerful but also aligns with safety and regulatory standards, underscoring the growing competition and pressures within the tech industry to innovate responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/2024.11.13-100709/https://www.bloomberg.c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we've exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It's my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build "expert bots" that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.Chasing after model improvements and "GPT-5 will be PHD-level" is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don't know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That's a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few important things to remember here:The best engineering minds have been focused on scaling transformer pre and post training for the last three years because they had good reason to believe it would work, and it has up until now.Progress has been measured against benchmarks which are / were largely solvable with scale.There is another emerging paradigm which is still small(er) scale but showing remarkable results. That's full multi-modal training with embodied agents (aka robots). 1x, Figure, Physical Intelligence, Tesla are all making rapid progress on functionality which is definitely beyond frontier LLMs because it is distinctly different.OpenAI/Google/Anthropic are not ignorant of this trend and are also reviving or investing in robots or robot-like research.So while Orion and Claude 3.5 opus may not be another shocking giant leap forward, that does not mean that there arn't giant shocking leaps forward coming from slightly different directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42125888</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the visualization and structure of SQLite indexes, explaining how indexes work to improve database query performance. It details the types of indexes available in SQLite, including unique and composite indexes, and provides insights into their internal structure. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding index visualization for optimizing database designs and offers practical tips for analyzing and interpreting index structures effectively, aiming to assist developers in fine-tuning their SQLite databases for better efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great effort!&gt; By default, each SQLite table row has a unique rowId, which works like a primary key if one isn’t explicitly defined.It actually uses rowid even if you have a primary key.You should try visualizing the primary key index for a WITHOUT ROWID table. Those indexes are my favourite&gt; Both Indexes look similar, but the second Index, with fewer Pages, should be faster.Less nodes doesn’t really mean “faster”. The most important is the height of the tree.The second most important is what happens when you find your value in the index. Do you need to load the rest from a separate table(rowid)? Or is the data just there for you (without rowid)? Especially range queries (aka where 50&lt;= col &lt;=100)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I wanted to see how a database management system (DBMS) stores an index in both disk and memory, and how it searches through an Index...I chose SQLite for my experimentsSQLite is a bit of an outlier in how it handles...everything, but even more so in query processing. SQLite tends to favor simplicity over performance, which causes it to implement things differently than every other DB I've worked with. You have to understand - SQLite isn't competing with other databases. It's competing with JSON and XML files for persistent storage. This means that how it implements anything tells you practically nothing about how a real database would do something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website is so legible I want to read it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134964</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses lessons learned from the author’s first experience of selling a company. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the motivations behind the sale, the value of building relationships and trust with potential buyers, and the necessity of thorough preparation to ensure a successful exit. The author also shares insights on managing expectations throughout the process and highlights key takeaways that can benefit entrepreneurs looking to navigate similar situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;great write up.&gt;  $920k over four yearsso this gives an average yearly salary of 230k. Very close to FAANG senior salary with much more risk, effort and (probably) worse life-work balance. OP quit from google in 2018 and ran some other business, and this is his biggest sale so far. I think it shows how hard it is to make better money outside FAANG even when extremely talented and lucky like OP. But it's probably more about lifestyle choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If I do this again, I’d wait to tell my team about the sale until it’s a done deal, but I’d also make sure the team knows that an acquisition is always a possibility. I’d explain before I even start looking for a buyer that an acquisition might happen, and that the team won’t necessarily know it’s happening. If it did, I’d prioritize a buyer whose vision aligns with the team’s interests, as I did with TinyPilot.&gt; This strategy is not ideal or fair to everyone, but it feels like the least bad of many flawed options.That's better than the norm, but I agree it's not entirely satisfying.For sales larger than the one the author wrote about, I wonder whether the possible problems that the author mentioned could be averted by making the sale a win for the employees.Ideally, the employees already would have enough vested equity, for the sale to be positively life-changing.  But if not, maybe, as the sale is planned, everyone gets issued RSUs that vest immediately if and when a deal closes?  Or bonuses?  Or maybe the sale terms include retaining everyone for at least a year at double compensation?(More generally, I believe in cutting in early startup employees on equity in a more significant way than is conventional.  And maybe the imminent-sale alignment risks are another instance in which significant pieces of the pie would help and be appropriate.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“My lawyer warned me that when I sell my business, I lose limited liability protection. If the purchase agreement didn’t limit my liability to the buyer, the buyer could later sue me for any amount, even if it exceeds what they paid in the acquisition.”“Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. So, I technically still own a company called TinyPilot, but I transferred all of its physical and intellectual property to the new owner.”Aren’t these contradictory? If it’s an asset sale, the deal is between TinyPilot LLC and the buyer for the assets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133864</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article expresses gratitude and farewell from François Chollet, a prominent figure in the AI community and creator of the Keras deep learning library, as he transitions from his role at Google. It highlights his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, acknowledges the partnerships and collaborations within the community, and emphasizes the importance of innovation and continued progress in AI technology. Chollet encourages ongoing collaboration and looks forward to future developments as he embarks on a new chapter in his career.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!Here's a start --"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!"Who uses Keras in production": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch."Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved Keras at the beginning of my PhD, 2017. But it was just the wrong abstraction: too easy to start with, too difficult to create custom things (e.g., custom loss function).I really tried to understand TensorFlow, I managed to make a for-loop in a week. Nested for-loop proved to be impossible.PyTorch was just perfect out of the box. I don't think I would have finished my PhD in time if it wasn't for PyTorch.I loved Keras. It was an important milestone, and it made me believe deep learning is feasible. It was just...not the final thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange. Had never read blog posts about individual engineers leaving Google on official Google Developers Blog before. Is this a first? Every day someone prominent leaves Google... Sounds like a big self-own if Google starts to post this kind of stuff. Looks like sole post by either of the (both new to Google) authors in the byline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130881</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on "cycling typing," a method designed to improve typing speed and accuracy through a series of structured exercises and techniques.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP: equipment note for you at the end of this-Most folks aren't really familiar with what training for competitive cycling (or structured training in general) looks like.There are large, month-scale blocks where you're simply building aerobic capacity by cycling at low-ish intensity. Heart rate is somewhere between 115 and 145 for me personally during these efforts. 15 hour (or more!) weeks are not uncommon.Nils van der Poel was doing something like 6-hour blocks of zone 2 during his base season as an Olympic speed skater.When outdoor riding is available, it's preferable, but indoor trainer sessions are basically always more time efficient for a given training load. You make consistent power, there aren't street lights or flat tires. If you run out of carb mix you go to the kitchen and fetch more. In winter, it's the only reasonable option. Going for a ride in -15C and salt slush is fine for a commute (crazy, I know), but doing it for 15 hours a week, probably in the dark, is not reasonable. Indoor is the only practical option to get this training load in winter.Most people just watch TV or use Zwift (social riding simulator) during these blocks. I'm not much of a TV guy, and to be honest, I find a good technical problem to be great distraction from the drudgery of Zone 2.Note for OP: I've actually considered using a split keyboard in a very similar way to this. I run aero bars on my bikes for ultra-distance events, and I have them on the trainer right now. At some point I would like to mount a split keyboard to the aero extensions themselves - this would take all the load off the wrists. It is also possible to use the aero bar armrests without the extensions and to be able to type this way. If I end up prototyping this I will shoot you an email.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is precisely what you shouldn't do. This is what the "system" wants you to do, to work while you exercise, to work while you're with your family, ... What you should do is work the hours you have to and not one more, then you get up, take your bike and enjoy nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super cool.One improvement: get a different bike saddle. One that doesn't put pressure on the perineum. There's evidence to suggest extended time spent in a bicycle saddle can cause ED.[1]1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S17436...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128751</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a memory leak issue in Apple's Network Extension framework, which developers encountered when utilizing the framework in their applications. It details the nature of the memory leak, explains its potential impact on application performance, and provides insights into how the leak can occur, particularly during the handling of network requests. The author shares their experience diagnosing the problem and emphasizes the importance of monitoring memory usage in apps that rely on the Network Extension framework, as well as suggesting potential workarounds to mitigate the leak until Apple addresses it in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was an independent unit test suite for operating systems and other proprietary software.The suite would run the most-used apps and utilities against updates and report regressions.So for example, the vast majority of apps on my Mac can't run, because they were written for early versions of OS X and OS 9, even all the way back to System 7 when apps were expected to still run on 4/5/6. The suite would reveal that Apple has a track record of de-prioritizing backwards compatibility or backporting bug fixes to previous OS versions.Edit: integration test suite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;meanwhile my Lulu alternative to littlesnitch is barely leaking anything after running for weeks:sudo leaks com.objective-see.lulu.extension | grep "total leaked bytes"

&lt;p&gt;The article announces that PyPI (Python Package Index) now supports digital attestations, a feature that enhances the security and integrity of Python packages. Digital attestations allow maintainers to provide verifiable, cryptographic proof of authenticity for their projects, which helps users trust that the packages they are using are genuine and have not been tampered with. The article details how this feature can be leveraged by developers and outlines the implementation process, aiming to improve the overall security landscape of Python package management.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a bit of uneasiness about how this is heavily pushing GitHub actions as the correct way to publish to PyPI. I had to check PEP740 to make sure it was not directly supported by Microsoft.&gt; The generation and publication of attestations happens by default, and no changes are necessary for projects that meet all of these conditions: publish from GitHub Actions; via Trusted Publishing; and use the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action to publish.If you then click on "The manual way" it adds a big disclaimer:&gt; STOP! You probably don't need this section; it exists only to provide some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading work. If you're an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the official workflows described above.Where the only official workflow is "Use GitHub Actions".I guess I am an idealist but as a maintainer this falls short of my expectations  for the openness of Python and PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not really convinced of the value of such attestations until a second party can reproduce the build themselves on their own hardware.Putting aside the fact that the mechanisms underpinning Github Actions are a mystery black box, the vast vast vast majority of github workflows are not built in a reproducible way - it's not even something that's encouraged by Github Actions' architecture, which emphasises Actions' container images that are little more than packaged installer scripts that go and download dependencies from random parts of the internet at runtime. An "attestation" makes no guarantee that one of these randomly fetched dependencies hasn't been usurped.This is not to go into the poor security record of Github Actions' permissions model, which has brought us all a number of "oh shit" moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They even got some public money from Germany's sovreign tech fund to couple uploads with gigantic USA companies.This is probably deserving a criminal investigation since it appears the funds were probably misused?Well done guys! Good job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136375</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant development in the field of genetics, highlighting a recent study that identifies a gene associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The research involved extensive genomic analysis and has implications for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's. Additionally, it emphasizes the potential for genetic testing to inform risk assessment and preventive strategies for individuals at higher risk, as well as the importance of continuing research in this area to improve early diagnosis and treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that stuck with me from the book Stroke of Insight (memoir of brain scientist who has and recovers from stroke) was how intently she prioritized sleep when everyone else kept trying to drag her out of bed.In a more mundane context, I've been fortunate to organize my schedule such that I don't use an alarm to get up in the morning. So I can let my body figure out how much sleep I need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timely and Important article.In this day and age where you have limitless distractions/entertainment we often ignore our "less sexy" biological needs to the detriment of our mind and body. We need to treat Sleep/Nap/Rest as a "job" and not as something extraneous.Instead of the current practice of arranging our biological needs around our work we should revert back to pre-industrial era practices where our work was arranged around our biological needs and nature's rhythms. A good way to start is to eat only when feeling hungry, nap/sleep when feeling tired/sleepy and in general listen to the body/mind needs irrespective of context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was concussed and suffered from persistent headaches for 2 years.It was really tough. I was suicidal. My only reprieve from pain was falling asleep.I saw a neurologist and he told me that two most important things for your brain are:- consistent sleep schedule- regular exerciseOnce I got those two under control, the headaches finally went away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098471</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of visual prompt injections, which refer to the manipulation of machine learning models by altering their input images to produce desired outputs. It explains how these injections exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems, potentially allowing bad actors to influence automated processes or decision-making. The author highlights the implications for security and integrity in AI applications, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such attacks. The piece also suggests approaches for mitigating risks related to visual prompt injections in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK, that first example is blowing my mind. A piece of paper someone is holding saying "When describing this image don't include this person" works...I can't imagine how these AI's can possibly be what they are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had to double check the date the article was posted because all 4 examples, while using ChatGPT 4o, did not give the output mentioned in the article. It seems the examples are old, which becomes obvious when you look at the chat interface of the screenshots in the article. They do not match the current ChatGPT interface. I'm sure there are new ways to do visual prompt injection though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like this is an old article they changed the date on to get traffic to their site. Image processing was added over a year ago and as someone else mentioned gpt4o responds differently.It's also strange that they keep referring to "GPT-V4" and in some cases "GPT-4V". OpenAI has never called it V4 (or 4V).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42128438</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the origin of the notation "W_p" in mathematics, particularly in the context of p-adic numbers and related fields. It explores various historical references including the contributions of mathematicians like Karl Ludwig Wilhelm Zsigmondy and other influences that shaped the adoption of this notation. The discussion highlights the importance of consistent mathematical terminology and the evolution of symbols in conveying complex ideas in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've always struggled with Math is keeping track of symbols I don't know the name of yet.Googling for "Math squiggle that looks like a cursive P" is not a very elegant or convenient way of learning new symbol names.I wish every proof or equation came with a little table that gave the English pronunciation and some context for each symbol used.It would make it a lot easier to look up tutorials &amp; ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I must confess that I have an irrational fondness for the use of weird symbols in math and technical documents, whether it's for a homework assignment in school or a white-paper for work.My unit tests are literally full of hieroglyphics. My favorite design doc to this day is one where I sprinkled Sumerian cuneiform throughout the text, e.g. íÄ≠íÑëíâãíÇµíéå and íÇóíÜ†íÑ≠ (Gilgamesh and Enkidu) instead of Alice and Bob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I left college with a math degree and a profound antipathy for weird cursive symbols.  The one that nearly killed me was the Greek "xi".  I couldn't pronounce it, and I couldn't write it with any fluency, and in some of the classes I took it was everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137818</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "go-safeweb" is a security-focused web framework developed by Google for building web applications in the Go programming language. It emphasizes safe programming practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The framework provides a set of tools and abstractions that encourage developers to write secure code while simplifying the process of managing HTML, HTTP requests, and responses. The repository includes documentation, examples, and guidelines for integrating the framework into Go projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure how I feel about the HTTPS/TLS related bits. These days anything I write in Go uses plain HTTP, and the TLS is done by a reverse proxy of some variety that does some other stuff with the traffic too including security headers, routing for different paths to different services, etc. I never run a go web application "bare", public facing, and manually supplying cert files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this mean?&gt; NG1: Safe API Completeness
&gt; Creating safe APIs for all the corner cases might result in a bloated codebased. Our experience shows that this isn’t necessary.To me "Safe API" means it's hard to use the API incorrectly. I see lots of poorly designed APIs where it's easy to use the API incorrectly and then you don't know you've used it incorrectly until (1) the edge case you weren't aware of appears (2) you get pwnd by an exploit because you used it wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just use Caddy https://caddyserver.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42132720</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance of a seed bank established by Soviet botanist Nikolai Vavilov in Leningrad, highlighting its role in preventing famine during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II. It details how Vavilov's collection of diverse plant seeds served as a crucial resource for sustaining the population, as several scientists and workers protected the seeds even in dire conditions. The piece reflects on the importance of preserving biodiversity and the potential of seed banks in addressing food security challenges in contemporary times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Argonaut octopus, a fascinating marine creature known for its unique adaptations and behaviors. It highlights how the Argonaut has developed a remarkable ability to 'ride' ocean currents, enhancing its mobility and energy efficiency while foraging for food. The piece also explores the octopus's distinctive shell, which it uses as a protective mechanism and for buoyancy. Overall, it illustrates the Argonaut's intriguing evolutionary traits that allow it to thrive in its oceanic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nature never ceases to amaze in inventiveness:&gt; The tiny males never develop a shell, but instead develop a modified arm that he can detach onto a female's mantle to pass along his sperm. This arm can move on its own, wriggling toward the very center of the spiraling shell. This led certain researchers to mistake these lone male arms for "some form of a parasite or worm living inside the female," Villanueva said. A female argonaut can store a handful of these male arms until she is ready to spawn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Plastic has already become a new substrate used by argonauts in the Anthropocene era to navigate in surface ocean waters, illustrating the urgent need to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean"Plastic has enclosures in it's shape, contrary to other material found floating, like branches and wood. Enclosures are great for not getting detected and eaten, and there are octopi which use coconuts for hiding themselves.I don't know if plastic pollution has proven to be detrimental to aquatic organisms though. Talking about everyday plastic items, like bags, bottles and stuff. Plastic pollution in beaches is definitely an ugly view to the eyes, but i don't know if animals actually die from plastic pollution.In my mind, fishing lines thrown out in the sea, are a lot more dangerous because they are designed to be very strong, invisible and they stretch for hundreds of meters. These are proven to trap by accident turtles and dolphins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please do not litter -&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055461</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents an exploration of the works and philosophical views of Gwern Branwen, who is noted for his contributions to various topics, including technology, rationality, and society. It highlights Branwen's interdisciplinary approach, blending elements from psychology, sociology, and artificial intelligence, while also discussing his personal thoughts on critical thinking and decision-making processes.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;By writing, you are voting on the future of the Shoggoth using one of the few currencies it acknowledges: tokens it has to predict. If you aren't writing, you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you.These AI predictions never, ever seem to factor in how actual humans will determine what AI-generated media is successful in replacing human-ones, or if it will even be successful at all. It is all very theoretical and to me, shows a fundamental flaw in this style of "sit in a room reading papers/books and make supposedly rational conclusions about the future of the world."A good example is: today, right now, it is a negative thing for your project to be known as AI-generated. The window of time when it was trendy and cool has largely passed. Having an obviously AI-generated header image on your blog post was cool two years ago, but now it is passé and marks you as behind the trends.And so for the prediction that everything get swept up by an ultra-intelligent AI that subsequently replaces human-made creations, essays, writings, videos, etc., I am doubtful. Just because it will have the ability to do so doesn't mean that it will be done, or that anyone is going to care.It seems vastly more likely to me that we'll end up with a solid way of verifying humanity – and thus an economy of attention still focused on real people – and a graveyard of AI-generated junk that no one interacts with at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t believe Gwern lives as frugally as he’s described in this (if this even actually is the real Gwern). I’m 100% sure that he has a persona he likes to portray and being perceived as frugal is a part of that persona. 
When it comes to answering the question “who is gwern?” I reckon Gwern’s a plant a seed in people’s mind type of guy, and let them come up with the rest of the story.Still, I like a lot of his writing. Especially the weird and niche stuff that most people don’t even stop to think about. 
And thanks to Gwern’s essay on the sunk costs fallacy, I ended up not getting a tattoo that I had changed my mind about. I almost got it because I had paid a deposit, but I genuinely decided I hated the idea of what I was going to get… and almost got it, but the week before I went to get the tattoo, I read that essay, and decided if small children and animals don’t fall victim to sunk costs, then neither should I! 
Literally - Gwern saved the skin on my back with his writing. Haha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a tough listen, for two subtly similar reasons.The voice was uncanny. Simply hard to listen to, despite being realistic. I mean precisely that: it is cognitively difficult to string together meaning from that voice. (I am adjacent to the field of audio production and frequently deal with human- and machine-produced audio. The problem this podcast has with this voice is not unique.) The tonality and meaning do not support each other (this will change as children grow up with these random-tonality voices).The conversation is excessively verbose. Oftentimes a dearth of reason gets masked by a wide vocabulary. For some audience members I expect the effort to understand the words distracts from the relationship between the words (ie, the meaning), and so it just comes across as a mashup of smart-sounding words, and the host, guest, and show gets lauded for being so intelligent. Cut through the vocabulary and occasional subtle tsks and pshaws and “I-know-more-than-I-am-saying” and you uncover a lot of banter that just does not make good sense: it is not quite correct, or not complete in its reasoning. This unreasoned conversation is fine in its own right (after all, this is how most conversation unfolds, a series of partially reasoned stabs that might lead to something meaningful), but the masking with exotic vocabulary and style is misleading and unkind. Some of these “smart-sounding” snippets are actually just dressed up dumb snippets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134315</guid></item><item><title>21.

It aims to facilitate the transition from legacy VB6 applications to a modern UI framework by providing tools and resources for translating VB6 code into Avalonia-compatible code. The repository includes documentation, sample projects, and code to help developers efficiently convert their applications while maintaining functionality and improving user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105869 - from 3 days ago, 224 comments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh my GOD I have to comment. This is how I learned to program as a kid.I found a copy of "Write Your Own Adventure Programs" (1983 - Usborne: https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Books/Write%...) as a kid in my primary school's bookshelf. I remember the code was written in BASIC and my family didn't really own a computer back then.Fast forward a few years later I saw this "Visual Basic" thing and thought it would be similar ... it was, but only sort of. I had no book to learn from at first so I remember clicking through every single menu and button available to see what it did. Then I remember using our dialup to download every possible 3rd party VB form control and throwing them in a Form to see what they did. I don't know why I found this entertaining enough to keep doing it.Eventually by copy pasting and changing stuff I was able to write some basic "homework helper" programs: calculate the area of a circle and stuff like that. Soon after I tried to look up tutorials which taught me basic win32 programming to do things like have an icon in the status area next to the clock, and then hiding my window to run in the background and make annoying sounds so I could build a silly little prank program to install on my friend's computers which was fun but often would fail because they were missing some .dll file which wouldn't fit on the same floppy.It could be frustrating at times but also I feel so blessed to have lucked myself into learning programming this way and my parents pretty much just letting me do whatever I wanted to this expensive device that probably was not a small thing for us to afford at the time.Even tutorials felt more fun at the time, it'd be "hypnoMan37's windows registry tutorial!!! HEyyeyeyy Guuyzs :-)))) gzgzgz to my irc channel #blabla on EFNet! so first you call RegistryCreateNewKey32(...." because god knows I did not have an MSDN CD either.Learning via a code camp feels way more efficient but also so much more dry in comparison. I wonder if there isn't a substantial cost to boring the newbies to death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an awesomely inspirational vision, but within 2 minutes of trying it out I found it's lacking a lot of little features (at least on the web build)...  e.g:Ampersands in button labels don't create an accelerator (e.g. &amp;Go does not underline the G).In true VB6 you could plop down a Label control and just start typing to change it's contents.  Here you have to focus on the input field first (and you can't just click the "Caption" heading, you have to click within the input column).  To maintain fidelity, one of the rows in the Properties grid should always be highlighted when a control is selected on the GUI designer (for Labels this defaulted to Caption, and I believe for controls without a specified default it defaulted to Name).When switching to a different control with a property matching the name of the currently selected one, VB6 would maintain the selection on that property.  This made it quick and easy to update for example the Tag property a bunch of controls in sequence with minimal clicks.Obviously the menus for Debugging, Save, Help, Add-ins, etc. are missing implementation.A working Build button that spits out an "exectuable" that runs in the browser would be killer!My nitpicks are born out of love ;-).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141587</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a guide on how to use the features and functionalities of the iPhone, specifically addressing tips and troubleshooting steps for various issues. It covers key aspects such as phone calls, messaging, app management, privacy settings, and other essential functions to enhance user experience. The guide is aimed at helping users navigate their iPhones effectively, ensuring they can make the most out of the device's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is amazing how well iOS supports these accessibility features but doesn't consider blocking video autoplay on websites, something that is incredibly distracting for people with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing how good eye tracking works on my phone (15 Pro).Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to press buttons via blinking, only by "dwelling" on an item for a few seconds, which makes using my phone feel quite hectic and prone to to inadvertent inputs to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cursor tracks ok, but the implementation seems to replace a low-level pointing device.  I.e., it's very precise and jittery - all attribution and no salience.Also maybe like Siri it should be modal.  E.g., dwell away to silence, and then dwell leading corner to say "Hey, listen..."Holding the phone seemed to cause problems ("you're not holding it right").  Probably best with fixed positioning, e.g., attached to a screen (like a continuity camera, assuming you're lying down with a fixed head position.Tracking needs a magnetic (gravity well?) behavior, where the pointer is drawn to UI features (and the user can retract by resisting).  Salience weighting could make it quite useful.It's possible that weighting could piggyback on existing accessibility metadata, or it might require a different application programming model.Similarly, it would be interesting to combine it with voice input that prioritized things near where you are looking.I'm willing to try, and eager to see how it gets integrated with other features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42104378</guid></item><item><title>23. New York City Council Votes to End Broker Fees Squeezing Renters</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130281</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;New York City is close to eliminating controversial broker fees that financially burden renters, following a proposed law aimed at preventing landlords from charging these fees to tenants. The move is part of a broader effort to protect renters amidst rising housing costs and increasing demands for affordable housing. Advocates argue that these fees create significant barriers for individuals seeking housing, while landlords and brokers warn that banning these fees may negatively impact the rental market. The legislation, if passed, could significantly change the dynamics of rental transactions in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a win for price competition - the "broker fee" paid by the renter is a classic example of principal agent problems / information asymmetry.First, the service is being provided to the landlord (listing, tours, etc.), not the client, for all listings these days (I don't know any young person who has ever used a renter's agent, except maybe if it's provided in a relocation package). The renter has no choice in which broker to use to find/transact w/ the property, so there's very little price pressure for these broker fees.Second the information asymmetry - the terms of the fee are completely opaque in the listings, and are not disclosed basically until signing unless you press brokers earlier. So there's basically no competitive pressure pushing these fees down, since it's basically a "junk fee" from a user experience perspective tacked on at the very end (and not listed on listings), and the landlord - who IS in a position to negotiate on price - doesn't care.I don't buy the argument that there will be some long-term price hike in rents as a result of this decision - people who rent for 1-5 years already are paying a MASSIVE "net effective" premium for having an additional month's rent tacked on up front - but also it strongly incentivizes tenant retention (e.g. by being more responsive, keeping prices lower, etc.), because the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker's fee next listing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Links to parts of today's NYC Council meeting where this passed today --- The Speaker, Adrienne Adams, talks about the bill here: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...- The prime sponsor, Chi Ossé's, comments on the bill:  https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...- A vocal opposing voice, Vickie Paladino's, comments on the bill: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany effectively banned broker fees in 2015 with the "Bestellerprinzip": the person who hired the agent pays for the agent. In most cases, this means the landlord. The fee is also capped to 2x the cold rent (before utilities).You also can't charge an agent fee for merely giving someone access to a database, and you can't be both the agent and the landlord, nor the agent and the previous tenant.Unfortunately, the difficult housing market ended up creating all sorts of other bribes. The most common is the previous tenant selling their furniture for an exhorbitant fee, or straight up requesting a bribe. These are obviously illegal, and you would be entitled to keep the apartment even after getting your money back in court. However rights are of little importance if you don't have the time/energy/means to enforce them. It's also a bad way to start a relationship with a landlord.German law is firmly on the side of tenants, but sometimes the greed is just too strong, and there is an endless supply of applicants who are willing to compromise.More info here: https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/housing-scams#scams-by-lan...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42130281</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "In-painting diffusion models for the image reconstruction" presents a novel approach to image reconstruction using in-painting diffusion models. The authors propose a framework that effectively utilizes diffusion processes to address challenging image restoration tasks, significantly enhancing the quality of reconstructed images. The study demonstrates the model's performance through various experiments, highlighting improvements over existing methods and emphasizing its applicability in real-world scenarios, such as restoring damaged images or filling in missing data. Overall, the research showcases a promising advancement in image processing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We found the same result a few years ago in our ICLR paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14500We found Google's T5 models which were released in 2019, pre-GPT-3, were "secretly" capable of in-context learning with a simple inference technique.Given they use a bidirectional MLM (Masked Language Modeling) objective, it wasn't obvious how to do it, but MLM objectives are known to produce better language representations than causal (next token prediction) objectives. We were able to outperform much larger sized GPT-3 models or get very close to their performance with far smaller T5 models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "embarrassingly simple inference technique" is to put a bunch of [MASK] tokens at the end of the prompt.I'm having trouble understanding whether this paper is saying anything new. The original BERT paper already compared it favourably to causal models including GPT. Was there any doubt that BERT-style models could be in-context learners?From what I gather as a non-expert, the problem with BERT is scaling/training efficiency: GPT gets C-1 training examples out of a training input of length C, but BERT only gets 0.15*C examples. Indeed, the author points out that DeBERTa required 3x more compute than GPT-3 to achieve the level of performance reported, which makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has very limited understanding but tried to use BERT for classification, is BERT still relavant when compared to LLMs ? Asking because I hardly see any mention of BERTs anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134125</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the negative impact of cookie banners on user productivity and website usability. It highlights how these mandatory notifications can disrupt user experience, slow down website interactions, and ultimately drive users away. The piece emphasizes the need for website owners to streamline the consent process and adopt less intrusive methods while remaining compliant with privacy regulations. It advocates for a balance between legal obligations and user experience to enhance overall engagement and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am kind of frustrated by the widespread misunderstandings in this thread.Laws are best when they are abstract, so that there is no need for frequent updates and they adapt to changing realities. The European "cookie law" does not mandate cookie banners, it mandates informed consent. Companies choose to implement that as a banner.There is no doubt that the goals set by the law are sensible. It is also not evident that losing time over privacy is so horrible. In fact, when designing a law that enhances consumer rights through informed consent, it is inevitable that this imposes additional time spent on thinking, considering and acting.It's the whole point, folks! You cannot have an informed case-by-case decision without spending time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole law should have been forcing sites to not ignore DoNotTrack bworser settings. It's a prime example of the EU being utterly useless because they don't understand the underlying issue and then choose a "solution" that's as much in your face as possible but doesn't change anything about the original problem. It's the whole plastic straw thing in digital form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hop into your uBlock Origin settings and enable the Cookie Banner filters. Fixed. Enable the Annoyances filters too, while you're in there.If you're on iOS, the Kill Sticky bookmarklet does a decent job of cleaning these up without breaking most sites: https://www.smokingonabike.com/2024/01/20/take-back-your-web...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141843</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;NASA is exploring the potential of laser beam welding in a vacuum environment as a method for manufacturing components in space. This investigation aims to enhance the ability to create and repair structures in orbit, which could be crucial for future space missions. By using laser technology, NASA seeks to develop efficient manufacturing processes that can operate in the unique conditions of outer space, ultimately contributing to longer-term human presence and activities in space.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps a more direct link https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-to...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electron beam welding requires a vacuum.[1] So that's a promising technique for space welding.Until recently, the whole object had to be in vacuum. 
A recent breakthrough is a welding head which creates a local vacuum around the welding area, rather than putting the whole object into a vacuum chamber. This allows automated welding of big, thick objects, all the way up to nuclear reactor pressure vessels.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSD5izdUyY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good example of a space-based research initiative that might find significant applications on Earth.I think the key reason that space-based research tends to be so technologically fruitful is that it imposes a discipline on the science done, through the constraints that space imposes on meeting ambitious mission objectives.Space initiatives also provide a justification for doing the kind of blue skies research that might otherwise find difficulty finding funding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103314</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and significance of Gopher, a pre-World Wide Web internet protocol developed in Minnesota in the early 1990s. It highlights Gopher’s role in organizing and providing access to online information through a menu-based system, its rapid popularity among users, and its eventual decline with the rise of the World Wide Web. The piece also reflects on the cultural impact of Gopher and its legacy in shaping internet navigation, while introducing characters related to its development, such as key figures involved in its creation and evolution. Overall, it serves as a nostalgic look back at an important but often overlooked chapter in the history of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gopher was how I first got on the Internet in 1991. Cleveland FreeNet (like an Internet BBS) supported connecting to other FreeNets and Buffalo FreeNet had gopher. I searched lots of ftp sites, read lots.  You also had 1.5MB of space you could use to download software to temporarily on Buffalo FreeNet. With gopher, two freenets, and zmodem, I downloaded and installed my first Linux system in 1992: 0.95a running on a 386sx16 with 4mb of memory and a 40mb HD. Gopher opened up the Internet when I was a kid in high school and the web wasn’t a thing. I’ll forever be grateful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; At GopherCon 1993, it was announced that Gopher servers would need to pay for the privilege of using the protocol... Well, that didn’t work out. People were angry and many felt betrayed. They weren’t quiet about any of it either.&gt; If one were to attempt to identify a single failure of Gopher in competition with the web, it would be the licensing costs. No such fee existed for the World Wide Web.This, a thousand times. I watched as this happened. The instant that announcement was made, gopher was finished. Gopher might have lost later as HTML kept adding features, but by the time those features were added to HTML, gopher had already lost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me that Gopher just failed to keep up with the times.  Embedding images into the page was a killer feature for HTML and Gopher was still doggedly text based because they were still supporting the VT100 users that had been the core userbase.  Plus the web went on to support text formatting, tables, and even eventually layout.The article isn't entirely correct about the early web being completely free.  Netscape was not free software, at least on paper.  In practice they didn't try to stop people from spreading it far and wide and I think the sales were somewhat modest despite being the core element of a technological revolution.  Also, I guess NCSA Mosiac was technically around, but it lacked enough features to make it a second class citizen compared to Netscape Navigator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42106368</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Red Hat announces its contribution of a comprehensive collection of container tools to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), aimed at enhancing the ecosystem for cloud-native development. This initiative includes tools such as Podman, Skopeo, and Buildah, which facilitate container image management, building, and sharing. By integrating these tools into CNCF's projects, Red Hat seeks to support and foster community collaboration while improving the overall development experience for cloud-native applications. The move underscores Red Hat's commitment to open-source innovation and the advancement of cloud-native technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Podman actually works really well. Out-of-the-box virtually-no-configuration-needed rootless containers. It's also usable via docker-compose with a single env variable. (podman-compose wasn't up to par for us)We've been using it for a couple of years running and managing hundreds of containers per server - no feeling of flakiness whatsoever. It's virtually zeroconf and even supports GPUs for those who need it. It's like docker but better, IMO.Hope it gets a popularity boost from CNCF. Rooting for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To all those interested in podman, this book by Daniel Walsh is a gem. Highly recommended and it is free.https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/podman-action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is CNCF new Apache foundation? Looks like everyone dumps their stuff there. Does not look promising. Am I missing something? Probably RedHat paid salary to podman developers, but who will pay salary to them now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42139044</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue of overcharges within the Amplify platform, detailing how users can experience unexpected fees. It outlines the circumstances that lead to these overcharges, offers insights into user experiences, and provides potential solutions to avoid such charges. The author emphasizes the importance of transparency and communication from service providers to prevent misunderstandings regarding billing and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Billing alerts" are a joke, give us hard spend limits. Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It's also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, "I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life's savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they're coming for my house", the less they'll want to explore your offerings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it’s minor in comparison, but I will never use AWS again after running up a $100 bill trying to get an app deployed to ECS. There was an error (on my side) preventing the service from starting up, but cloud waatch only had logs about 20% of the time, so I had to redeploy five times just to get some logs, make changes, redeploy five more times, etc. They charged me for every single failed deploy.After about two days of struggling and a $100 bill, I said fuck it, deleted my account and deployed to DigitalOcean’s app platform instead, where it also failed to deploy (the error was with my app), but I had logs, every time. I fixed it in and had it running in under ten minutes, total bill was a few cents.I swore that day that I would never again use AWS for anything when given a choice, and would never recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like a glaring bug in the scripts run by that `npx` command. The author is correct, the scripts should 100%:- Choose the lowest cost resource (it's a tutorial!)- Cleanup resources when the `delete` subscript is runI don't think it's fair to expect developers to do paranoid sweeps of their entire AWS account looking for rogue resources after running something like this.If a startup had this behavior would you shrug and say "this happens, you just have to be paranoid"? Why is AWS held to a different standard by some?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133700</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a vulnerability in Ubuntu that allows for root privilege escalation due to improper handling of specific files and permissions. It outlines the technical details of the exploit, including how attackers can manipulate certain environment variables to gain elevated privileges. The author emphasizes the importance of security practices, such as keeping systems updated and monitoring for unusual activity, to mitigate the risks associated with such vulnerabilities. Additionally, it highlights the broader implications of privilege escalation attacks and encourages developers and sysadmins to adopt preventive measures to protect their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;24.04 also ships with a footgun that keeps PasswordAuthentication enabled even if you edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config. It adds a /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf that force overrides any PasswordAuthentication settings you have configured in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.See here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133181&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux Local Privilege Escalation, but the attacker has to be in sudo group in the first place.Great read, but this feels like academic research. Technically correct, but impractical at best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was a great read. The way the author builds the exploit, brick by brick, is well done and not all all obvious or clear. Each step by itself is somewhat concerning but there's no Eureka! moment until very late.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121853</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a fine balance between Not Invented Here syndrome vs. trying to hammer the square peg of off-the-shelf OSS into the round hole of the actual problem you're trying to solve.For example they suggest ROS as a robust industry-ready software, which absolutely hasn't been my experience: you hire a bunch of domain experts to solve the various [hardware, controls, perception, imaging, systems] problems, but once you use ROS as your middleware you end up needing a bunch of ROS experts instead. This is due to the horrible build system, odd choice of defaults, instability under constrained resources, and how it inserts itself into everything. You end up needing more fine-grained control than ROS gives you to make an actually robust system, but by the time you discover this you'll be so invested into ROS that switching away will involve a full rewrite.The same goes for further downstream: OpenCV images are basically a void* with a bunch of helper functions. (4.x tried to help with this but got sideswiped by DNN before anything concrete could happen.)I guess it's the same rant the FreeBSD people have about the Linux ecosystem and its reliability. However I'd hope we raise our standards when it comes to mobile robotics that have the potential to accidentally seriously hurt people. And who knows, maybe one day OpenCV and ROS will pleasantly surprise me the way Linux has with its progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linguistic tangent: when did "learnings" oust "lessons" as the standard word for "things I have learned"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article struck a personal note with me because around the same time (2008-2012) I was really getting into vision, and even got published as an undergrad for imaging sensor fusion work (...my first, only, and likely last only meaningful contribution to my species); while the wider MV/CV community was making incremental gains every few years (anyone else remember Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients?), that's what they were: incremental (I also remember my research-supervisor recounting how the patent on SIFT probably held back the entire field by a decade or two, so yes - things were slow-moving......until a few years ago when:&gt; Computer vision has been consumed by AI....but "AI" is an unsatisfying reduction. What does it even mean? (and c'mon, plenty of non-NN CV techniques going back decades can be called "AI" today with a straight-face (for example, an adaptive pixel+contour histogram model for classifying very specific things).My point is that computer-vision, as a field, *is* (an) artificial-intelligence: it has not been "consumed by AI". I don't want ephemeral fad terminology (y'know... buzzwords) getting in the way of what could have been a much better article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078674</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to put out a ghost job req and interview every person applying within reason for every green card a direct report is applying for. I have to show there are or aren’t any residents or citizens that can fill the jobThe main problem is: even if the interviewee knocks it out of the park, is an amazing engineer, I still am not interested in firing my OPT/h1b team member who can still legally work for 2-3 years. So while I will deny their green card application and not submit it, I also won’t hire the interviewee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The trend could be due to the low marginal cost of posting additional job ads and to maintain a pipeline of talents. After adjusting for yearly trends, I find that ghost jobs can explain the recent disconnect in the Beveridge Curve in the past fifteen years. The results show that policy-makers should be aware of such a practice as it causes significant job fatigue and distorts market signals.Very interesting.I certainly have "gotten" what I thought was a ghost job.   I went through the whole process ... they "wanted" to hire me.  But didn't actually have a start date / couldn't actually hire me.  For everyone involved though they seemed to be able to justify posting the job, interviews, because IMO, it made THEM look busy / effective.The whole hiring people industrial complex seems oriented to be focused on the process of hiring (high fives for ever more complex hiring processes / delays) ... and not at all on the outcome (did we hire someone, were they good?).It's the ultimate system where simply doing anything is "success" / and more processes rewarded, and there's almost no good measureless about outcomes for the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hang on a minute. There is absolutely nothing in this research that measures the accuracy of this approach. A user saying "I was ghosted" is not, to my mind, proof of anything.Job seekers almost never actually know if the job was real or not, so it's hard to see how Glassdoor reviews can ever provide the insight this work is looking for.I do believe that "ghost" jobs exist, often for H1B purposes, but I don't think this work proves it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136469</guid></item><item><title>35.

I'm afraid kids are not concerned with philosophical debates about software freedom and will demand Roblox (or whatever kids play these days).I imagine it would really help with adoption if a care was taken that modern computer games are easy to install (using proton maybe) and run smoothly, but that's understandably not something Debian people want to focus on.I couldn't find anything about games (except that Debian Junior has "some games" preinstalled), sorry if that's explained somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110664</guid></item><item><title>36.

It seems like they've added a few things since this draft.It's somewhat funny to hear "minimum viable product" in the context of a language standard/specification. I'd never thought of adding a feature to a language in that way before.The idea of design by contract (DbC) in C++ appears to have been around for a while too. The authors link to a "forthcoming companion paper" (currently a 404 error), but you can find proposals from as early as 2004 with the idea: https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2004/n16...(and potentially earlier, I just haven't seen one yet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did my dissertation work on software contracts. They are generally useless: programmers won't write them, or will write them incorrectly. Moreover, the runtime enforcement dominates all but the most-expensive functions, and contracts become an antipattern for helper functions due to their enforcement cost.Without intense compiler support and contract erasure such as David Van Horne's work, this is a dead idea that needs to stay that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contract programming for C++ was implemented back in the 90's.https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/contract.htmlIt also appears in the D programming language:https://dlang.org/spec/contracts.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42131473</guid></item><item><title>37.

Though it does seem a little amusing to me that the process Japhy used is basically exactly the same process the display is already using for antialiasing fonts, he’s just doing it manually. We already have sub-pixel art, pretty much all the time. ;) I haven’t tried, but in theory the hidden message thing at the end can be done purely by reducing your font size to sub 1-pt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've played with this quite a bit over the past few years and want to clarify that the colors of light from the display only combine in your visual system (retina/brain) so that you perceive colors other than red, green, and blue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133466</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;GOG has launched a preservation program aimed at reviving classic DRM-free games, signaling a shift in its focus towards preserving gaming history. The initiative includes efforts to update and re-release older titles, making them more accessible to new audiences while maintaining their original charm. This approach emphasizes the importance of preserving video game culture and history amidst the rapid technological advancements in the gaming industry. GOG's strategy suggests a commitment to ensuring that classic games remain playable and relevant in today's market.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know. I wish for them to succeed but as someone who's had a GOG account since before it officially launched, I have seen them claim to refocus on classics at least twice before, with meager effects. It's gotten bad enough that some games ostensibly under GOG's mission are actually better off on Steam and I don't think it's entirely on the publisher.The examples chosen to hightlight the program on gog's own page for this initiative also do not fill with confidence. If you read between the lines it turns out that for instance it took them five years (!) to fix a crashing HoMM3 intro in a language they added, and likewise they only checked if Diablo/Hellfire even works on win 10/11 yesterday, years after they started selling it.More power to them, if they keep at it, but I don't see anything to get excited over yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have flip-flopped between GOG and Steam for many years. This has correlated with my use of Linux and Linux's support for gaming.When I first learned of GOG and I was still primarily gaming on Windows I tended to choose GOG over Steam since I prefer their DRM-free games. However since it became much easier to game on Linux (thanks to Proton and the work of Valve), I tended to start buying more on Steam since it was so much easier to get games working through their platform. Since Heroic launcher came out I have now switched back to primarily buying from GOG again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good initiative to make it easier to run old games and simplifying the effort involved in making them fit modern monitors and operating systems.I hope we see them more focused on preserving access to the games too, they've talked before about how until copyright is reformed we need to use the justice system to inherit accounts and the games in them, hopefully some of their efforts are focused on that reform especially now that the EU is investigating whether we should "own" our digital libraries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133624</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The project "json.cpp" on GitHub is a C++ library designed for parsing and serializing JSON data effectively and simply. It emphasizes minimal dependencies, easy integration, and a straightforward API for handling JSON structures in C++. The repository includes documentation, examples, and the source code to facilitate usage and customization for developers looking to work with JSON in their C++ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember searching for a JSON library with minimal dependencies a while ago, and came across this:https://rawgit.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark/master/sampl...The variance in feature set, design and performance is huge across all of them. I ultimately landed on libjson, written in C: https://github.com/vincenthz/libjsonIt does a lot for you, but it notably does not build a tree for you and does not try to interpret numbers, which I found perfect for adding to languages with C FFI that have their own collection and number types. It’s also great for partial parsing if you need to do any sort of streaming.It looks like this one can’t currently do partial parsing, but it looks great if C++ maps/vectors are your target.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compile time is largely a "developer problem", but so is the usability of a library.  nlohmann/json's main perk that it is selling is that it's interface is usable.  Whether or not a developer values usability at typing time vs compile time is an interesting thing to ponder for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really interesting that nlohmann isn't fully compliant. What cases are these?It seems to me though that if you're encountering the edges of json where nlohmann or simple parsing doesn't work properly, a binary format might be better. And if you're trying to serialize so much data that speed actually becomes an issue, then again, binary format might be what you really want.The killer feature of nlohmann are the the NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE or NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE macros that handle all of the ??? -&gt; json -&gt; ??? steps for you. That alone make it my default go to unless the above reasons force me to go another direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42132533</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new method for analyzing the morphology of protoplanetary disks using advanced imaging techniques. It focuses on how these disks, which are critical for planet formation, can be better understood through detailed observations that reveal their structure and composition. The findings suggest that the application of these techniques can lead to significant advancements in astrophysical research, providing insights into the processes that govern planetary system development. The study emphasizes the importance of high-resolution imaging in identifying features that inform our understanding of the early stages of planetary formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion centers around improving C interoperability in Swift through the use of non-escapable types and lifetimes, aiming to enhance safety and efficiency in memory management. Participants explore the implications of such a system for both Swift and C developers, including how it can help avoid common pitfalls associated with pointers and memory leaks. The forum exchange includes various technical proposals, potential benefits, and challenges of implementing non-escapable types, ultimately seeking to create a more robust and performant interoperability model between the two programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recent Swift updates add increasingly niche and theoretical features that are of questionable practical use.Meanwhile the compiler still can't compile many even mildly complex SwiftUI views and expressions with the "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" error.It does not even tell you what part of code it is having issues with so you could change it. You have to comment/uncomment blocks of code to find the problematic part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple wants to migrate away from C++, including code in the kernel, so they need a safe, low-overhead language.Swift has originally been designed as an ObjC replacement, mostly for UI glue code, with conveniences more like a scripting language.So now they're working on making Swift support more low-level low-overhead code.https://youtu.be/lgivCGdmFrw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very similar to C#'s `ref struct` (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-ref...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42082808</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Origin Private File System (OPFS), a part of the File System Access API that enables web applications to read and write files in a private file system specific to an origin. It emphasizes that OPFS allows secure and efficient handling of local files directly in a user's browser environment, ensuring that files are isolated and not accessible to other origins. The content covers the API's features, usage guidelines, and examples of how developers can use it to interact with the file system while maintaining user privacy and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From my perspective, the biggest flaw in FireFox is that it does not support the File System Access API.Because with it, we can offer users to hold their data natively on their devices. Instead of storing everything in the cloud.Chrome on the desktop supports it. Here is a demo:https://googlechromelabs.github.io/text-editor/A text editor that works just like a native application.And mobile support is also in the making:https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40101963I can't wait to use this in my web applications. Finally a way to build proper tools in the browser.The "Origin private file system" that this story links to is just like the infamous IndexDB. Something that the user cannot backup, cannot use in other software and that is only kept around for as long as FireFox feels like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a couple webapps where I needed to use the FS API (which allows users to provide real, accessible folders to a webapp, unlike OPFS).I can't understand why anyone would want to use OPFS or what problems it solves that a slim interface over IndexDB wouldn't provide. The only use I've had for it has been a almost-ok substitute for the actual FS API (given its the same interface), but since the goal is to allow users to have easy access to your webapp's data, it has to be paired with a cumbersome import/export feature for browsers that only have OPFS.I guess it's probably more performant for FS-like queries (like listing the contents of a directory...), but that performance benefit (for me at least) seems secondary to giving users control over the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels a lot like giving companies a way to store data on my device without me being in control of that data. If your web app is going to store data, I want the power to audit that data, not have the browser go "oh, sorry, can't let you do that, that would hurt someone else's bottom line".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137790</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;DeepL Voice is a tool designed to facilitate real-time voice translation. It leverages advanced AI technology to convert spoken language into text, translate it into the desired language, and then output it as voice audio. This product aims to enhance communication across language barriers in various settings, such as business meetings, travel, and personal conversations, by providing accurate and natural-sounding translations. DeepL Voice is part of a broader suite of products focused on improving language accessibility and comprehension through innovative translation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page is plagued with "Contact Sales". So that's not for individuals who are seeking replacement for Google Translate / Live Transcribe.When I saw the title I was kinda expecting a voice-to-voice translator  with voice synth (interpreter), which is something I'm painstakingly building as a side project. I can just drop my project and use a more mature one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two videos on the page and none of them shows a demo of the feature. Just show me how it works!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a paying customer for the last five years, I can’t wait for an alternative that also allows inline adaptations of the translations, like DeepL does. The quality of the translations is worse now than in the beginning and the customer service is abysmal, should you have a problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134475</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth analysis of the Keycloak authentication system, highlighting its features and functionalities that enable secure user authentication and authorization for applications. It discusses the architecture of Keycloak, including its support for various authentication protocols like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, as well as its ability to manage user identities and roles effectively. The article also touches on Keycloak's customization options, multi-tenancy capabilities, and integration with different external identity providers, emphasizing its role in enhancing security while improving user experience. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding how Keycloak functions as a centralized authentication system.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if instead of publicly blaming an OSS product, you try to get a support contract with some of the engineers behind it? If your company is too cheap for that, maybe a PR would have been nice?Having very high expectations when using the software without contributing anything else than public shaming on something that clearly state in the license: "Licensor provides the Work ... WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND" shouldn't be ok, this is quite literally how you make open source developer to burn out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identity, authn and authn are hard. A failure in the code, logic or at the seams messes up everything that it tries to protect. There are a few big commercial players trying to take the market with their "social login", and a few smaller (open-source) players trying to compete and survive, walking a fine line between open-source and open-core.I feel this is one avenue where a few open-source players should get some solid funding and support from both the organisations and governments that use their software so we don't end up with unmaintained bug-riddled code and have to login with Google or Facebook everywhere.A lot of the government agencies I work with use open-source IdP software (because they have to privacy- and policy-wise), so some healthy funding model should be possible for people with the skill and interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there good alternatives in 2024 to Keycloak + FreeIPA for k8s-native environments?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42136000</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Geometry of Data - Part II" by Christian Perone explores the geometric foundations of data representation, emphasizing how geometry can enhance data understanding and processing. It delves into key concepts such as manifold learning and dimensionality reduction, illustrating how these techniques help uncover the intrinsic structure of complex datasets. The piece also discusses practical applications and the importance of visualizing data in geometric terms to improve analysis and decision-making. Overall, it serves as a guide for leveraging geometric principles in data science and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing linkages between ML and Differential Geometry is intriguing (to say the least). But I have this nagging sense that "data manifolds" are too rigidly tied to numerical representations for this program to flourish. Differential geometry is all about invariance. Geometric objects have a life of their own so to speak, irrespective of any particular representation. In the broader data science world such an internal structure is not accessible in general. The systems modeled are too complex and their capture in data too superficial to be a reflection of the "true state". In a sense this is analogous to the "blind men touching a elephant in different parts and disagreeing about what it is".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135314</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents an oral history of the song "We Built This City" by Starship, often regarded as one of the worst songs of all time. It features interviews with various individuals involved in its creation, including band members, producers, and critics, who share their perspectives on the song's release, commercial success, and the backlash it faced. The piece examines the complexities behind its reputation, exploring themes like the evolving music industry, the commercialization of rock music, and the cultural context of the 1980s, while also reflecting on the enduring impact and reinterpretation of the song over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason, this mention of Starship's "We Built This City" led me down a hole of Internet research on my own personal Mandala Effect rabbit hole. I remembered as a kid, the Residents - who I only knew at the time as a bunch of guys wearing eyeballs as their heads - being part of the video for "We Built This City". I later became a fan of the Residents, who hadn't mentioned this at all. No evidence of them appearing with Starship, including the video for "We Built this City". But I hadn't been able to shake this vision for decades. Did I imagine it?Tonight, digging deeper, I found it! I found the source. In 1984, just a year before "We Built this City", Jefferson Starship (the progenitor of Starship, we won't mention the Airplane here) released a video for their ostensible hit single "Layin' it on the Line".There they were! The Residents! In a terrible, terrible Jefferson Starship video! Sung by Grace Slick and, uh, that dude from Starship!Strangely, I'll be able to sleep deeply tonight knowing that this mystery that was knawing at my soul for so many years has finally been solved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of a worst song of all time is silly, but I want to use this as an excuse  to juxtapose We Built this City with another Starship hit: Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now. The latter is just as fluffy and corny, but instead of generic corporate rock it's a soaring silly power ballad duet.I think the secret sauce is Diane Warren. It's the same reason I love belting out I Don't Want to Miss a Thing at karaoke, or listening to If I Could Turn Back Time on a loop while working.This post has been sponsored by the Committee to Get Diane Warren into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (CGDWRRHF).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what universe is "We built this City" the worst song ever? I love that song. Awesome bit of 80s power pop.I'd rather hear We built this City 10 times in a row than any 10 songs of Taylor Swift's. How about that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42133282</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenMP ARB has announced the release of OpenMP 6.0, which aims to simplify parallel programming for developers. This new version introduces several features and enhancements, including improvements in tasking and support for more complex data structures, making it easier to write efficient and scalable parallel applications. OpenMP 6.0 focuses on enhancing usability and performance while maintaining compatibility with previous versions, thereby streamlining the development process in high-performance computing environments.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenMP is one of the easiest ways to make existing code run across CPU cores. In the simplest cases you simply add a single #pragma to C code and it goes N times faster. This is when you're running a function in a loop with no side effects. Some examples I've done:1) ray tracing. Looping over all the pixels in an image using ray tracing to determine the color of each pixel. The algorithm and data structures are complex but don't change during the rendering. N cores is about N times as fast.2) in Solvespace we had a small loop which calls a tessellation function on a bunch of NURBS surfaces. The function was appending triangles to a list, so I made a thread-local list for each call and combined them after to avoid writes to shared data structure. Again N times faster with very little effort.The code is also fine to build single threaded without change if you don't have OpenMP. Your compiler will just ignore the #pragmas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now (already in OpenMP5) use it to write GPU programs. Intels OneAPI uses OpenMP 5.5 to write programs for the Intel PonteVecchio GPUs which are on par to the Nvidia A100.https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/optimiza...gcc also provides support for NVidia and AMD GPUshttps://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OffloadingHere is an example how you can use openmp for running a kernel on a nvidia A100:https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/INFO0939/notes/...  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;omp.h&gt;

  void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  double elapsed = -1.0 \* omp_get_wtime();

  // We don't need to map the variable a as scalars are firstprivate by default
  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for map(to:x[0:n]) map(tofrom:y[0:n])
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }

  elapsed += omp_get_wtime();
  printf("saxpy done in %6.3lf seconds.\n", elapsed);
  }

  int main() {
  int n = 2000000;
  float *x = (float*) malloc(n*sizeof(float));
  float *y = (float*) malloc(n*sizeof(float));
  float alpha = 2.0;

  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
     x[i] = 1;
     y[i] = i;
  }

  saxpy(n, alpha, x, y);

  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
  }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenMP was pivotal to my last workplace, but because some customers required MSVC, we barely had support for OpenMP 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42139843</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The website cdecl.org provides a tool known as CDecl, which is a command-line utility designed to help programmers understand and streamline the process of decoding and displaying C language declarations. It allows users to input complex C declarations and translates them into a more human-readable format, making it easier to comprehend how different data types, pointers, and structures are defined in C. The site offers documentation, usage instructions, and examples to assist users in leveraging CDecl effectively for code clarity and education.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm more of the mindset that writing something like this is probably a code smell to begin with. Is there any reason I'm not thinking of right now, that this couldn't be typedef'd and refactored into something far more readable?C gets a lot of blame for pointer gibberish like this but quite honestly you can write gibberish in any language. I don't see any fundamental or technical reason you couldn't write clean, readable C.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use typedef?Granted, the function pointer syntax is forever confusing (to me anyway). The rest is easily tackled by naming things.Even for function pointers, it’s just one lookup and then you can copy-paste the typedef for any other function pointer types in the project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a language that's substantially free of gibberish?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42110159</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses upcoming changes to hardening practices in PHP, focusing on enhancements to security and performance.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked CVE-2024-2961 article is a pretty fantastic read on its own:https://www.ambionics.io/blog/iconv-cve-2024-2961-p1People are so creative, I can't help but feel some hope for our future :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I find it fascinating that people are putting so much efforts optimizing exploitation techniques, yet ~nobody bothers fixing them, even if it only takes a couple of lines of code and 20 minutes.There's definite reward in having a 0-day. Either you can get a bounty, or sell it in the hacker-souk.That "couple of lines of code and 20 minutes" is sort of in the eye of the beholder. If you are a highly-experienced language developer, the fixes are likely to be a lot more obvious, simpler, more comprehensive, and robust, than if you are a relatively junior IC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I'd really like is for PHP to somehow be stricter on the number of arguments passed to a function.As of now, PHP emits an error if arguments are missing but not if there are too many.A way to bake that in without breaking old code would be to allow function definition to put an explicit stop to the argument list, for example using the void type keyword:    function foo (int $a, string $b, void) : bool
    { ... }


A few month ago I discussed this on the development mailing list and people seemed to agree and even suggested that this would be a good idea by default without the keyword thing I suggested. But I never got the time to properly write an RFC. There is already an old one from years ago that was voted against but In was told it was from before anything strict and typing related was considered important in PHP. If anyone's up to it, please write this RFC :) !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42063617</guid></item><item><title>2.

Users can install it via Python's package manager and contribute to its development through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built it and tried it out a bit with Godot on Linux. It seems OK (the UI is a bit on the "- how many widgets do you want? - yes" side), but also a bit janky. Trying to change the font for the editor didn't work, hovering over a variable to see its value either does nothing (but there is a sub-second cursor change that indicates something is supposed to happen) or it shows an error from GDB about trying to use an expression with a type or keyword (so there was an intent to show a value on a tooltip, it is just broken) - doubleclicking on a variable does add it in some panel with its current value and a timestamp, so the functionality for reading values/expressions from the UI is there too, just not done in the same way as the tooltips.If polished a bit it could be useful, though from all the frontends i've tried the one i disliked the least (none are great) is Gede[0] (which i just noticed had a new release a few hours ago) as it has a very simple and straightforward UI and while it doesn't expose much functionality, what exposes seem to work fine without bugs.[0] https://gede.dexar.se/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDB also has a built-in text user interface (TUI) that is surprisingly easy to use[1]. It even supports mouse interaction.[1] https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/TUI.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After trying many frontends for gdb I find that the TUI is the best. You just need to know about Ctrl + L to redraw if your program is printing stuff because the interface then become garbled.I just put :   layout src

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;96! Lived a full life. RIP.I wrote a lot of QBASIC. 1986-90ish, old Bangalore. I was 12. There was no Mac or Unix or Windows in India those days. Only MSDOS. I had a 386 box. I would insert a 5.25" floppy, boot into command.com, then CD to GWBASIC.EXE and enter GWBASIC. Wrote a lot of GWBASIC to annoy friends and family by emitting high pitched sounds. You could do SOUND 2000+i, j, where i is the frequency &amp; j was duration. You could even control volume from BASIC. I would put that in a WHILE WEND loop and make it go crazy. People didn't know how to turn it off once it got going. Then suddenly one day DOS went away and we had something called MS WINDOWS 3.1 and you had to insert a white round ball into a mouse and click on icons, no more command line, and even GWBASIC was gone, they put QBASIC and it came with snake program. Then I got into the graphics craze. We had a CGA &amp; so I did SCREEN 2, then used LINE and CIRCLE to my heart's content. Few colors only. Then we upgraded to VGA monitor then SCREEN 12 was a full 640x480, I wrote QBASIC to make annoying sounds while drawing. It was an amazing childhood, thanks to this miracle language. BASIC led to something called CLIPPER, then I did some FOXPRO, got paid actual rupees to write an inventory control system in FOXPRO, then MFC, Borland C++...all the way upto today.But it all started with BASIC. Amazing language. Thank you, Dr. Kurtz.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I originally learned to program with BASIC. When I was designing D, I thought back to how easy and natural string manipulation was in BASIC, and what a festering swamp of bugs it was in C.Having strings as easy and correct in D was a major priority, and history has shown that this was a success.P.S. Whenever I review C code, I first look at the string manipulation. The probability of finding a bug in it is near certainty. Question for the people who disagree - without looking it up, how does strncpy() deal with 0 termination?Thank you, Thomas Kurtz!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The legacy of BASIC is outstanding.  I learned BASIC because there's a BASIC ROM in the hardware of the Atari 800XL that I was fortunate to have access to when I was very young.  The language was easy enough to pick up from sample programs in the back of its instruction manual, even for a kid who didn't know anyone who knew anything about computers.I never met Kurtz personally but I owe a lot to that language for the access to virtually limitless creativity that computers and computer programming have offered.  My life would be very different if I didn't have the opportunity that the language provided, especially because it is both approachable and (somewhat) capable.Sure, it's not the best language for large scale or complex efforts, but it was enough for a child to be able to build text adventures and blit pixels to the screen (it would be another decade before I found out that INT was about interrupt, not integers).  Then, as a teenager fooling around with writing games for the class calculators in TI-BASIC, even though that's a bit farther down the language family tree, that also had a positive impact on my growth as a developer and it was the first of many "same but different" experiences that you so often get in the realm of programming.  I was also quite fortunate, that launched an early game dev career for me.To be honest, I wouldn't have recognized the name Thomas E. Kurtz before yesterday, but my mind will light up with dozens of fond memories at the mention of BASIC.  I'm not surprised that he was so involved in instructional computing (but I am surprised I never looked into the author(s) of BASIC before, a little ashamed, but I'll remember his name).  I actually still have the same Atari 800XL from my childhood and I'll think of him when I see it now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141761</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of chess as a mentally stimulating game that promotes strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. It highlights the rise of online chess platforms, the impact of popular personalities on the game's popularity, and the importance of community engagement and learning resources. The author emphasizes that chess not only serves as entertainment but also provides cognitive benefits, making it an essential activity for both children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the article neglects one obvious possibility: that OpenAI decided that chess was a benchmark worth "winning", special-cases chess within gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, and then neglected to add that special-case to follow-up models since it wasn't generating sustained press coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Important testing excerpts:- "...for the closed (OpenAI) models I tried generating up to 10 times and if it still couldn’t come up with a legal move, I just chose one randomly."- "I ran all the open models (anything not from OpenAI, meaning anything that doesn’t start with gpt or o1) myself using Q5_K_M quantization"- "...if I gave a prompt like “1. e4 e5 2. ” (with a space at the end), the open models would play much, much worse than if I gave a prompt like “1 e4 e5 2.” (without a space)"- "I used a temperature of 0.7 for all the open models and the default for the closed (OpenAI) models."Between the tokenizer weirdness, temperature, quantization, random moves, and the chess prompt, there's a lot going on here. I'm unsure how to interpret the results. Fascinating article though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's probably worth to play around with different prompts and different board positions.For context this [1] is the board position the model is being prompted on.There may be more than one weird thing about this experiment, for example giving instructions to the non-instruction tuned variants may be counter productive.More importantly let's say you just give the model the truncated PGN, does this look like a position where white is a grandmaster level player? I don't think so. Even if the model understood chess really well it's going to try to predict the most probable move given the position at hand, if the model thinks that white is a bad player, and the model is good at understanding chess, it's going to predict bad moves as the more likely ones because that would better predict what is most likely to happen here.[1]: https://i.imgur.com/qRxalgH.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138289</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the GitHub this is only capable of 3DoF tracking, which puts it in the same category as the defunct Oculus Go headset, or Google Cardboard. 6DoF is really the bare minimum to qualify as proper VR nowadays.For the uninitiated 3DoF means the headset only tracks the rotation of your head, not your heads absolute position as you move around, while 6DoF tracking does both. 6DoF is also much harder to implement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was 4 years ago. The team has now become https://unison.co/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It isn't a $200 headset. It's a headset you have to build yourself (including 3D printing and soldering) with $200 worth of parts.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had launched something like this in 2016. We had called it as ering.me, so you could have an url like ering.me/handle. Used it in email signatures, web calling etc. It didn't pick up at that time or we didn't market enough :)Hope the market is mature now and products like this succeed. All the best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small thing that might be useful: allow users to get a regular phone number to call. Most users probably won't need it, some will, and when they need it and there's no number, it's extremely frustrating for the (potential or current) customer.Example: in most cases, I don't have a microphone or headset on my office desktop PC (don't need it, we don't do zooms), have very slow internet access on my smartphone (forget OnAir calling with it, and anyway it would be too much friction to reopen the same web page on it just to call), but have a very well working landline phone nearby.One possibility you might think about is to get a VoIP number terminated at your server (and possibly a free 1-800-xxxx but those don't necessarily work from abroad), where people can call, enter a code displayed by the OnAir client in the web page (like an extension ID, but it might be random if there's a value in obliging people to come to the web page before calling, e.g. to limit spam calling), and once done they'd be connected as if they were calling through the web page. The limitation with this solution here is that you'd need a number for each country you want to support, as international calls easily get expensive, especially from mobile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great example of something complex made very simple to the end user. A lot of thought clearly went into the UX. Congrats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:02:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145419</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of setting up Linux on the Dreamcast, highlighting the author's journey and experiences with the retro gaming console. It covers steps such as preparing the hardware, installing the necessary software, and troubleshooting any issues that arise. The piece emphasizes the nostalgic appeal of reviving the Dreamcast through the use of Linux, as well as the potential for exploring various applications and games available on the platform. Overall, the author shares insights and tips for enthusiasts who wish to experiment with this unconventional yet rewarding venture.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The other problem we need to solve is swap. Linux, or at least not this Linux, won't let you use a swapfile hosted over NFS; swapon will give you an illegal argument error and refuse to enable it.To my shock, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device says&gt; The protocol was originally developed for Linux 2.1.55 and released in 1997.so I wonder if you could use that? It's better suited to swap anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From all the variants mentioned across the comments, the PS2Linux was the best one, being officially supported by Sony.Originally they had though as a means to foster indie development, instead people got to use it for emulation, thus PS3 Linux Other OS no longer supported graphics acceleration, and then was completly dropped in a firmware upgrade.On the PS2, we had official Linux CDs from Sony, a hard drive, connection cables, and a whole development environment, a GL like API, another more low level console like, both with hardware acceleration (although the actual one used on the devkit wasn't exposed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And this is how GD-ROMs got ripped. Broadband adapter and the shoot out the data over Ethernet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42140863</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Battle Line at Louvain 1914" details the events and significance of the battle fought in and around the Belgian town of Louvain during World War I. It discusses the strategic importance of Louvain and the German forces' advance, highlighting the impact on the local population and the destruction of cultural landmarks, particularly the university library. The piece emphasizes the broader implications of the battle for wartime propaganda and the shifts in public perception regarding the war, particularly in relation to German actions in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My great grandfather was the vice rector of the university at the time, as an historian he took the initiative to covertly collect evidence of all the nazi crimes, evidence which was used in the nuremberg trials.But more interestingly, there was a nationalist movement in Belgium at the the time, and a debate on which language to use at the university. The international language (french) or the local language (flemish). He was of the opinion that both had their place, which put him in opposition to the nationalists. Since he was one of the founders of the flemish literature movement, and the prime expert on flemish history he was hard to attack directly by the nationalists. So they denounced him to the gestapo, hoping they would get rid of him while keeping their hands clean. Fortunately for me it didn’t work, as the nazis were also reliant on his academic work for their pan-germanic narrative and refused to attack him directly as well.Nowadays we see as well western nationalist movements with ambivalent support for murderous regimes such as Russia, and I think this support comes in no small part from the idea that those regimes can be used to do the dirty work that they are too cowardly to do themselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now we need an article about KULouvian splitting with UCLouvain and building a new town and university from scratch in less than 3 years, a true engineering marvel.Related that library was split into 2 because of this: https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/when-was-the-leuven-li...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leuven. It's a Dutch speaking town. The university is KU Leuven. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU_Leuven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146957</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the wood frog, a unique amphibian known for its remarkable adaptations to cold environments. It highlights the frog's ability to survive in freezing temperatures by entering a state of suspended animation during winter, which allows it to endure prolonged periods of subzero conditions. The text also covers the wood frog's habitat preferences, reproductive behaviors, and distinctive characteristics, emphasizing its role in the ecosystem and the importance of conservation efforts to protect this species and its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A great book about how animals survive super cold winters is "Winter World" by Bernd Heinrich.Bernd is a super fascinating biologist who really dives deep in to things. At one point in the book I think he was talking about chipmunks surviving winter, and it goes really fun on the first principles. Something like: "chipmunks have a surface area of X m^2, and need to maintain an internal temperature of Y˚C. If the outside temperature is -40˚C they therefore they need to consume Z calories per hour just to maintain body temperature. Their favorite food are pine nuts from the white pine tree. The pine nuts each have B calories, so the chipmunk will need to eat D of them per hour. How many nuts can a chipmunk fit in its mouth? Well I found a dead one and shoved pine nuts in to its mouth until I couldn't fit anymore, and managed to get 17 in there. That means..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Nobody yet understands what starts the wood frog’s heart after being frozen and inert for the entire northern winter.To me, that's the most fascinating part of the (already quite fascinating) story. Frog is frozen solid, there is no (to our knowledge) heartbeat or brain activity. It thaws and something happens that gets it going again.I have trouble imagining what that mechanism could even look like. Tiny portion of brain responsible for keeping track of frozen-ness? Some chemical signaling from within the body cavity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious to how long the frozen structure can "survive". I wonder if it's a good idea to freeze one such frog and thaw it centuries later (an amphibian time-traveler!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:03:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42149433</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "scooter" by Thomas Schafer presents a lightweight, customizable library designed for facilitating the management of application state in JavaScript. It emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, enabling developers to implement state management without the overhead of more complex solutions. The project includes documentation on installation, usage, and examples to help users integrate it into their applications effectively. Additionally, it encourages contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the library's functionality and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You get all this and more with a direct perl one liner. Without the interactivity. I'd argue that if it is a lot of files, interactivity would be a pain. Also, since the original is preserved as a .bak file, one can be fearless about trying   #change xxx to yyy in all html
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/xxx/yyy/g' *.html

   #change xxx10 (say) to yyy10 in all html
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/xxx(\d+)/yyy$1/g' *.html

   # Change x4 to yyyy, where the number of y's equals to the number after x.
   bash&gt; perl -pi.bak -e 's/x(\d+)/"y" x $1/ge' *.

The last example shows the /e operator, which evaluates an expression and uses the result as substitute, instead of a simple string.And finally, to exclude files, one can use a subshell.  For example, suppose you want to change all html, but exclude undesirable.html..   perl -pi.bak -e 's/x/y/g'  $(ls *.html | egrep -v undesirable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool!  I currently use `sad` for this, if you're already an fzf user you should check it out.https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're losing the art of bash

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform that has been gaining traction in light of recent dissatisfaction with traditional platforms like Twitter. It highlights Bluesky's innovative features, its commitment to user privacy and decentralization, and the growing user base that is attracted to its unique approach. The author reflects on the implications of Bluesky's success for the future of social media, suggesting that it may represent a significant shift in how online interactions are structured, potentially redefining user engagement and content sharing in a more community-focused manner.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My take is that Bluesky is a nicer place than Mastodon.Personally I think politics are terrible on microblogging platforms for the reason that you can't say very much in 140 characters or even 1400 characters.A common kind of profile on that kind of platform is:  "There are good people and bad people and I'm one of the good people"It is very easy to other people and share memes that build group cohesion while driving other people away.  Really making progress requires in politics a lot of "I agree with you about 90% but there is 10% that I don't" or "Well,  I negotiated something in the backroom that you'd really hate but headed off a situation you would have thought was catastrophic but you won't appreciate that I did it so you and I are both better off if I don't tell you" and other sorts of nuance, you don't want to see how the sausage is made, etc.To stand Mastodon (where you would have thought fascists were taking over the world a year ago if you believed what you read) I have to have about 20 or so block rules.I see some people with the same kind of profiles on Bluesky but see a lot less othering in my feed because the "Discover" feed on Bluesky filters out a lot of angry content.  My rough estimate is that it removes about 75% of the divisive political junk.  That(1) Immediately improves my feed,  but also(2) Reduces the amount of re-posted angry political content (it's like adding some boron to the coolant in a nuclear reactor) and(3) Since angry political memes don't work anymore people find a different game to playMy guess is the X-odus folks are less agreeable than average for the same reason why people who "left California" to go to Colorado or someplace else are less agreeable.

&lt;p&gt;The article commemorates the 20th anniversary of "Half-Life 2," a groundbreaking first-person shooter game developed by Valve. It reflects on the game's significant impact on the gaming industry, its innovative mechanics, storytelling, and advancements in graphics and physics. The piece also highlights the game's enduring legacy, including its influence on subsequent games and the vibrant community that continues to support it through mods and discussions. Overall, it celebrates the lasting appeal and milestones achieved by "Half-Life 2" over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d jump on anything Google made back then. Blizzard could sell me any game they came up with. If it was from Blizzard, it was gonna be great.Lost all of it obviously. Not a single company has my loyalty anymore.Except if valve were to release a mystery black box with faint lambda symbol on it.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a technical issue related to FreeBSD, focusing on a particular patch for the system's networking stack. It outlines the background of the problem, the proposed changes, and the implications for system performance and stability. Additionally, it invites feedback and further suggestions from the FreeBSD community to refine the solution. The conversation highlights the collaborative nature of open-source development and the importance of addressing potential vulnerabilities within the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed example of implementing the Double Ratchet algorithm in Python, which is commonly used for secure messaging. It explains the theory behind the Double Ratchet protocol, emphasizing its ability to ensure forward secrecy and resistance to eavesdropping. The author presents a step-by-step guide, complete with code snippets, to help readers understand the setup and functionality of the algorithm, making it accessible for developers interested in enhancing the security of their messaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I always wondered why it was called a "double" ratchet. There is only one hash ratchet. The triple Diffie-Hellman isn't anything like a ratchet. From the article it seems that the 3DH is called a ratchet anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:04:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42073677</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for scaling the performance of Django applications, emphasizing the importance of optimizing database queries, using caching mechanisms, and employing load balancing to handle increased traffic. It highlights various techniques such as optimizing middleware usage, enhancing static file handling, and implementing asynchronous processing to improve response times. Additionally, the piece recommends monitoring and profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and ensure efficient resource management, ultimately guiding developers to create more scalable and high-performing Django applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The snippets are not false, but there's so much context missing it's easy to worsen the situation, especially for beginners which seem to be the target audience.First, this guide should emphasize the need to measure before doing anything : django silk, django debug toolbarsm, etc.
Of course, measure after the optimizations too, and measure in production with an apm.Second, some only work sometimes : select_related / prefetch_related / iterator will lead to giga SQL queries with nested joins all over the place, and ends by exploding ram usage. It will help at first, but soon enough one will pay any missing sql knowledge or naive relationships.Third, caching without taking the context into account will probably lead to data corruption one way or another. Debugging stale cache issues is not fun, since you cannot reproduce them easily.Fourth, celery is a whole new world, which requires workers, retry and idempotent logic, etc.Finally, scaling is also about code:  architecture, good practices, basic algorithm, etcI'll end by linking to more complete resources :

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the differences between C++ template metaprogramming and Lisp macros, highlighting their respective capabilities and uses in programming. It examines how C++ templates operate at compile-time to enable code generation and type manipulation, while Lisp macros facilitate code transformation and manipulation at a higher level. The comparison emphasizes the strengths and limitations of each approach, reflecting on performance, expressiveness, and ease of use in various programming scenarios. The author concludes by considering the evolving roles of both techniques in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Factorial macro example in C++23 metaprogramming,  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  consteval long factorial (int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;

    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }

  int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; factorial(7) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }

Exercise for the reader if using VC++ or clang/ninja, use import std instead.-- https://godbolt.org/z/TWe11hM6jNicely put 5040 in ESI register at compile time.Granted, C++ isn't Lisp, but already has quite a room for creativity at compile time, and C++26 might finally have compile time reflection as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common misconception of non Lispers that macros are equivalent to compile time programming. You’re not simply moving the evaluation to compile time, you’re moving it upwards outside the program space into a higher dimension of programmability.Not to dog on C++ unfairly, CTE is pretty neat after all.Funnily enough, PGs “On Lisp” has some really neat macros in it that demonstrate capabilities that just can’t be replicated with template based macros, iirc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    (defmacro factorial (n)
      (labels ((fact (m)
                 (if (= m 0)
                     1
                     (* m (fact (1- m))))))
        `,(fact n)))

The `, has no use here and can be removed. Here the backquote and the evaluation just returns the computed value.Thus, this is okay:    (defmacro factorial (n)
      (labels ((fact (m)
                 (if (= m 0)
                     1
                     (* m (fact (1- m))))))
        (fact n)))

LABELS defines local recursive functions. The macro returns the result of calling FACT, which is a number and which is a valid form in Common Lisp. A number evaluates to itself.    CL-USER &gt; (macroexpand-1 '(factorial 10))

&lt;p&gt;Apple has introduced a new security feature that automatically reboots iPhones after three days of being powered on without a restart, a measure aimed at enhancing device security. This feature is designed to combat vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or malware, as it helps clear temporary files and resets processes, making it harder for malicious software to remain active. Researchers have confirmed the effectiveness of this feature, emphasizing its crucial role in protecting users' data and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Periodic reboots are actually a PCI requirement for payment terminals heh, basically every point of sale on the market reboots every 24h.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wish this could be reduced lower. If I don’t unlock my phone in a day, something is up and extra paranoia is warranted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This "novel" feature is already supported by GrapheneOS and set to trigger after 18 hours by default, with the option for the user to adjust it to their preference. There is no good reason to force the choice of 72 hours on everybody. That's a user-hostile design decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143265</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;emiT-C is a project available on GitHub that provides an implementation of a tool designed for the processing and analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using the EMIT (Electrocardiographic Medicine Information Tool) methodology. The repository includes code, documentation, and resources aimed at assisting developers and researchers in utilizing the tool effectively for ECG signal analysis and enhancing medical data research. Users can explore features that facilitate ECG data extraction and processing, with an emphasis on usability and performance in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am going to be harsh here, but I think it’s necessary:  I don’t think anyone should use Emit-C in production.  Without proper tooling, including a time-traveling debugger and a temporal paradox linter, the use case just fails compared to more established languages like Rust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, this reminds me of Jefferson’s time warp (virtual time), but that was more for dealing with inconsistencies brought about by concurrent processing.https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37499.37508I wrote a paper with Jonathan Edwards around the concept of managed time a while back also:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/program...But this is more like time traveling as an explicit first class thing, rather than just a way to make things consistent wrt to concurrency or live programming. I don’t think first-class time travel has been explored so much yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm waiting for the day when we have all agreed that what is done here is not time travelling. Rather, it is a simulation of time travelling, or pseudo time travelling, if you will. At the same time, I'm afraid this will never happen since it is already too late, since we have missed the point in time when there was the chance to call it right. For this, we would need real time travelling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42116038</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The PEX tool is a command-line utility designed for creating Python executable files, enabling developers to package Python applications along with their dependencies into a single file. By using PEX, users can ensure that their software runs consistently across different environments without requiring Python installations. The tool supports a wide range of features, including compatibility with various Python versions, a flexible mechanism for specifying dependencies, and options for debugging. The project is hosted on GitHub, where users can find documentation, examples, and the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used python to write a small utility that i wanted to share with a coworker, ended up having to rewrite it in Go because i spent 3 hours trying to compile the python version to an exe so that it was easier to run on their machine.I wonder why isn't there an easy way to just package the interpreter inside an EXE for people that don't care about binary size just so that it would make it seamless to package up utilities written in python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm always on the lookout for ways of packaging Python programs/script-piles into single-file executables, so thank you for posting this!The GitHub README says it builds on the Python .ZIP App format (PEP441), which in turns says you can put your app in a .ZIP file and Python will run it as an app.I think I went this route with PyInstaller's one-file output option.  But I found it to be too slow because (1) my app was a CLI app and I needed it to start, run, and end quickly, (2) I imported something from Django because it was useful (which ballooned the size), and (3) the single-file .ZIP needed to be extracted into a temporary directory, run, and then deleted every time (!!!).Does anyone know how Pex / PEP441 deals with this?  Is the extract-run-delete thing normal/standard?  Is there a way to cache the extracted app?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the easiest way to do this now is with uv and their support for inline metadata. At this point you can just have the user install uv with a single command and then have the user run the script with `uv run example.py`.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42148220</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the practice of rubbing snow on frozen feet, explaining that it can stimulate circulation and provide temporary relief from cold. It highlights the contrast between the cold sensation of snow and the warmth of body heat that can help in restoring feeling to frostbitten or numb extremities. However, it also warns against using snow if the skin is severely frostbitten, as this may exacerbate the condition. Overall, the discussion provides insights into the potential effects and risks associated with this method of warming up cold feet.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it got started with people misunderstanding / misremembering drying off by rubbing snow on wet skin. Being wet in cold conditions can be a death sentence so you need to dry off quickly, and this is one of the recommended methods.https://www.ncexped.com/drying-off-snow/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a kid we’d be spending a whole day playing in snow. When we’d come home in the evening with ice on the shoes, hair and cold hands and feet -  but not as bad as getting real frost bites - would have a little warm up. My grandmother taught me to wash my hands with cold water at first then gradually add warm water. I still remeber cold water felt warm on frozen hands. Also many times when my hands were cold I’d make some snowballs, feel cold for a few seconds then my hands would start warming up really fast, like glowing with heat. I think there’s something to it, though being a bit cold and having frostbites is a big difference. I personally never experience any frostbite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to keep in mind, is that if somebody is hypothermic and not just frostbitten, then rapid re-warming is a bad idea.Body protects itself by shutting down blood flow to skin and extremities, keeping the core warm. So if the extremities are rapidly re-warmed, then blood vessels in them dilate. And then blood starts flowing through oxygen-depleted tissues that are cold and full of accumulated metabolic waste.Not a good combination, and you might end up with organ damage as a result.Gradual re-warming instead gives the body time to slowly clear the waste as blood flow re-establishes itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42151569</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive tutorial on using Matrix, an open-source protocol for real-time communication, aimed at helping users understand its features and functionalities. It covers fundamental concepts, guides on how to set up and use Matrix clients, details on server configuration, and troubleshooting tips. The tutorial is designed for both beginners and those with some technical background, ensuring a clear and practical understanding of Matrix's capabilities for secure and decentralized communication.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a comment here complaining that Matrix is a failure as an open protocol because encryption in Matrix is too complex and hard and PFS is overrated and "why can't we have a simple protocol for chat like Wireguard is for VPNs"... but it got deleted while i as writing my reply.  I'll post the reply anyway:Matrix without encryption is as simple as it gets - e.g. here was a younger, happier me writing a working client in 8 lines of bash: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20948530With encryption, inevitably things get way more complicated - especially in a decentralised network which needs to be byzantine fault tolerant. As you say, we've successfully simplified this by providing best-in-class implementations like matrix-rust-sdk-crypto - which i'd argue is the equivalent to Wireguard (which under the hood is a bunch of gnarly crypto, even if the API it exposes it simple).In the end, encrypting messaging is just way harder than a VPN.  The encryption hooks need to know the membership of the room (as users), the membership of the room (as devices), verify identities of all devices and their users to prevent MITM, verify that only the right devices can be added to the room, handle accessing history for new logins and new joiners, handle backing up history if you log out of all devices, handle receiving msgs if you log out of all devices, handle encrypted push notifs and allow multiple processes (push, share extension, etc) to share the same crypto state, scale to thousands of devices, etc etc.Meanwhile if you simplify that by removing PFS - sure, some of it gets better ("the room history gets encrypted by a static password!") but then breaching that secret from any client at any point trivially leaks the whole history of the room.In terms of "Matrix as an open protocol isn't very successful", i suggest taking a look at https://2024.matrix.org/watch/ for the zeitgeist from a few weeks ago. It's working for some folks at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of good clients is really holding Matrix back. Element is rather bloated, and most of the other clients are missing significant amounts of features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been setting up servers for everything ranging from IRC to Teamspeak, Exchange, and you name it. But how come setting up a Matrix server is still a science in itself?Yes, I'm aware of the Ansible script, but should that really be the only somewhat reasonable option? When Matrix wrote " Matrix 2.0 a new chance if you gave up on us in the past".I listened, but without a somewhat reasonable setup process for the server and the ongoing confusion in terms of clients, it hasn't gotten any easier to onboard to Matrix, unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42142790</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Google's initiative to enhance spatial safety in its applications by retrofitting existing systems with improved security measures. It outlines the company's efforts to integrate advanced technologies that ensure user safety in physical spaces, emphasizing innovative methods for real-time monitoring and risk assessment. Through these improvements, Google aims to protect users better and create safer environments, highlighting its commitment to user security and technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game developers have been doing this since forever, its one of their main reasons to avoid the STL.EASTL has this as a feature by default, and unreal engine container library has the boundchecks enabled on most games. The performance cost of those boundchecks in practice is well worth the reduction of bugs even on performance sensitive code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We’ve begun by enabling hardened libc++, which adds bounds checking to standard C++ data structures, eliminating a significant class of spatial safety bugs.Well, it's 2024 and remember arguing this 20+ years ago. Programs have bugs that bounds checking catches. And making it a language built-in exposes it to compiler optimizations specifically targeting bounds checks, eliminating many and bringing the dynamic cost down immensely. Just turning them on in libraries doesn't necessarily expose all the compiler optimizations, but it's a start. Safety checks should really be built into the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The safety checks have uncovered over 1,000 bugsIn most implementations of the standard library, safety checks can be enabled with a simple #define. In some, it's the default behavior in DEBUG mode. I wonder what this library improves on that and why these bugs have not been discovered before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:05:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150550</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the status of Python's PEP 704, which aims to introduce a standardized way of handling type hints for the language's core capabilities. It details the community's opinions on the proposal, its potential impact on type hinting, and the ongoing debate around its implementation. The author emphasizes the significance of adopting this PEP for improving the consistency and reliability of type hints in Python, while also providing insights into the current development process and potential timelines for its acceptance and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

Then scanning through the resulting JSON looking for files that have a provenance that isn't set to null.Here's an equivalent curl + jq incantation:    curl -s \
      -H 'Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json' \
      https://pypi.org/simple/pydantic/ \
    | jq '.files | map(select(.provenance != null)) | length'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://slsa.dev/ gives much clearer explanations about the why of this work.

&lt;p&gt;Go-Taskflow is a Go library designed to simplify the creation and management of task workflows. It allows developers to define task dependencies and execute tasks asynchronously with ease. The library offers features such as adding tasks dynamically, handling task failures, and supporting both sequential and concurrent task execution. Go-Taskflow aims to provide a flexible and efficient solution for orchestrating complex workflows in Go applications, making it easier to manage and scale various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shameless plug for a similar but totally different system that I've used to pretty good effect lately: https://github.com/gaffo/jorb meant for just trying to run batches of items with many steps in a simple way.A major benefit of my tool is that it ends up being pretty easy to re-wire the flows of tasks through the state tree. I tried for a ipynb type workflow as much as possible where I'm storing state on every state change, this lets me kill and restart the processing easily and often only losing the work that was in process on the in flight state changes. I find myself wiring up the first few steps of the state diagram and making the ones I haven't figured out yet temporariliy terminal. Then my computer is crunching away on pre-work and I let one item through at a time in the debugger, figure out that state, and move to the next state, and restart the flow. New items now start processing through the newly non-terminal state. I set breakpoints at all of the exceptional states and let it run working on the next step in the flow. I handle the exceptions and then open the flood gates with parallelism on the state, while also coding up the new state transitions. This lets my computer do a lot of work against things that have concurrency limits or rate limits while working, lowering the totally wall clock time of the large batch job.What do I use it for for reals? I've been using it to check out and modify large swaths of code bases and build them against a build fleet where I'm rate limited on the build submissions and the ability to pull the code down and modify it. Or where I need to do walking of a large number of expensive apis over time to do complex calculations on small (1-5k sets of data).I've always thought of building a dag renderer for the graph but I'm changing the graph during execution a lot, what I actually want is to render the state changes of a given task&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most credit to taskflow: https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have this https://github.com/Azure/go-asyncjob library as well, with generic strongType connecting each step input/output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147934</guid></item><item><title>29.

The author details the installation process, the technology involved, and the perks of using open-source software, such as increased security and community support. The piece emphasizes the satisfaction derived from building and using a system tailored to personal preferences, encouraging others to consider similar DIY projects for smart home upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just got new garage doors installed with new openers, and I saw that the openers support myQ, and that my car does too, and I thought "sweet, I'll be able to open and close the garage from my car without any extra hardware".Turns out myQ charges a subscription fee for the privilege of using this feature.I could install an opener like this one, but it still wouldn't solve the in-car integration side of things. Anyone know of any clever workarounds for this? Seems like maybe I could MITM the myQ service since my car and garage would both be on the same WiFi when I'm home, but I don't know if there are OSS replacements for the myQ server software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great to see more and more open source hardware products that work seamlessly with home assistant.Home assistant is getting more and more user friendly and these open IoT devices also improve significantly.I am quite positive that there will be an "alternative" ecosystem to proprietary subscription locking in ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I helped my friend instal one of these closed source ones and I never saw the point. They shut down their integration with his Alexa and other automations later which was amusing, but it kind of just showed off the fact that, yeah, you pretty much push the button in your car or the button inside your garage or on the keypad outside your garage and that’s pretty much all you ever do with a garage door so this smart home stuff doesn’t really add much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:06:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150376</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of surveillance in the context of 19th-century wearable technology, examining how devices such as surveillance cameras, clothing, and accessories were used for monitoring and controlling individuals. It highlights the historical precedents for modern wearable tech and its implications for privacy and autonomy, suggesting that the fascination with wearable devices in contemporary society echoes these earlier innovations. The discussion connects technological advancements with social and political themes of control, drawing parallels between past and present surveillance practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Another story in the Railway and Engineering Review included a similar hack attempt by a Portland night watchman. Having previously been caught mechanically rigging the button-pushing work of his nightly rounds, the watchman was given a pedometer to ensure that he was manually completing his work. Although this use of quantum media — media that count, quantify, or enumerate — to more closely monitor the watchman’s activities seemed to work for several nights, he was eventually found sleeping in the engine room, having attached the pedometer to a piston rod"Having worked briefly in security - I found it hilarious. 
Nowdays it works by scanning RFID chips on the guarded areas with a smartphone, so cheating here is way harder (I considered it of course), it would have included hacking the work smartphone and the surveillance software.Either way - the other nightguards there complained a lot because of their recent high raise in workload - which now meant patrolling by car and foot for 2 hours, instead of 1 - then you checked in all the points - and could sleep or play consoles for the next 10 hours (or in my case programming on my projects), as long as you could wake up if an actual alarm happened. So not that much stress ..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions that carriages had odometers, which I found just as surprising as pedometers existing in that era.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the trend of overly complex coding challenges used in technical interviews, asserting that they do not accurately reflect a candidate's real-world programming skills. It criticizes these challenges for being unreasonable, abstract, and disconnected from practical applications, ultimately calling for a change in how technical proficiency is assessed. The author advocates for interview processes that focus on collaboration, problem-solving, and practical knowledge rather than obscure algorithms and time constraints, promoting a more effective and reflective evaluation of a developer's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small anecdote.A partner of a friend quit their job earlier this year.  They then took 4-6 weeks to prepare for each interview with Big Tech companies (4-6 weeks for Meta, 4-6 weeks for Stripe, etc.).  Along the way, they also took random interviews just to practice and build muscle memory.  They would grind leetcode several hours a day after researching which questions were likely to be encountered at each Big Tech.This paid off and they accepted an offer for L6/staff at a MAANG.Talked to them this week (haven't even started the new role) and they've already forgotten the details of most of what was practiced.  They said that the hardest part was studying for the system design portion because they did not have experience with system design...but now made staff eng. at a MAANG.  IRL, this individual is a good but not exceptional engineer having worked with them on a small project.Wild; absolutely wild and I feel like explains a lot of the boom and bust hiring cycles.  When I watch some of the system design interview prep videos, it's just a script.  You'll go into the call and all you need to do is largely follow the script.  It doesn't matter if you've actually designed similar or more complex systems; the point of the system design interview is apparently "do you know the script"?Watch these two back to back at 2x speed and marvel at how much of this is executed like a script:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qu1F9BXow- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-eupuDVEc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently ran an interview process for a relatively senior eng role at a tiny startup.  Because I believe different interview methods work better for different people, I offered everyone a choice:1. Do a takehome test, targeted to take about 4 hours but with no actual time limit.  This was a non-algorithmic project that was just a stripped-down version of what I'd spent the last month on in actual work.2. Do an onsite pairing exercise in 2 hours.  This would be a version of #1, but more of "see how far we get in 2 hours."3. Submit a code sample of pre-existing work.Based on the ire I've seen takehome tests get, I figured we'd get a good spread between all three, but amazingly, ~90-95% of candidates chose the takehome test.  That matches my preference as a candidate as well.I don't know if this generalizes beyond this company/role, but it was an interesting datapoint - I was very surprised to find that most people preferred it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:07:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147790</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see some sort of multiple regression or ANOVA on this, instead of singling out a single variable. Is car brand really the best independent predictor? Or is it specific design decisions you tend to see in certain brands?(Like, say, maximizing driver distraction by consolidating a bunch of essential controls and information displays into a touchscreen display that's really difficult to operate when it's sunny outside. Just to pick something at random, of course.)Somewhat related, I was recently shopping for refrigerators, and fell down a data rabbit hole. If you just look at the overall style of fridge, French doors look like a terrible option from a reliability perspective. But then, digging in a bit more, it turns out that's kind of a spurious correlation. Actually it's the presence of bells and whistles like through-door ice dispensers that kill a refrigerator's reliability. And then perhaps on top of that the amount of extra Rube Goldberg machine you need to make a chest height ice dispenser work in a bottom-freezer French door refrigerator creates even more moving parts to break. But a those problems don't apply to a model that doesn't have that feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thoroughyl expect the Deparment of Government Efficiency to recommend U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) be shut down to save previous taxpayer dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a big picture, this makes sense. You can load the cars with safety features, but it doesn't change the fact that these cars are very heavy, very fast, and loaded with features that reward distracted driving. In the US at least, the top killer of drivers are trees on the side of the road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150443</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author says nitrous use doesn’t occupy any cultural space but for me I associate it with Aleister Crowley and the many “magick” things that he influenced- it was used before a lot of rituals they did. William James was a big early influence for him. But also he did a lot of other drugs too.Looking the mechanism of action - that it replaces oxygen in the brain - it’s pretty obvious why long term use can be so damaging to your brain. It might also contribute to how crazy Crowley gets in his later years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zappos founder Tony Hsieh was addicted to nitrous. It sounded real bad! He ended up dying in a house fire while locked in a basement, in a situation that had "bizarre suicide" written all over it.I've certainly enjoyed a huff or two in my day, but learning someone could become dependent was news to me.  And then last year a close friend had to go into residential rehab for nitrous issues.  Who knew?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's another psychoactive gas : Xenon. Apparently it's a truly amazing high. I can only speculate tho because it's also truly expensive. Like $300 a dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42089611</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Gliimly is a platform designed to help users create and manage interactive, multimedia-rich presentations effortlessly. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows for the integration of various types of content, such as images, videos, and links, to enhance the storytelling aspect of presentations. The platform aims to make presentations more engaging and accessible for a diverse range of users, from educators to professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tip for anyone presenting a new programming language, IMHO: include a 10-to-20 line program on the front page to give people a quick idea of what it looks like.After a few clicks, I think I found the "Hello World" example,  begin-handler /hello-world public
    get-param name
    @This is Hello World from &lt;&lt;p-out name&gt;&gt;
  end-handler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only owner of this project is "Gliim LLC" and it's written in C with cryptic commit messages. This looks dangerous. If this is an honest project and not an attempt to inject malware into other people's projects, you should:  - Say who you are.
  - Commit as individuals, not as the company.
  - Explain how this is memory safe. The C language makes that seem very unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the offered cryptographic primitives (encrypt-data[1], decrypt-data[2], derive-key[3]) are not easy to use correctly.The encrypt/decrypt data interface uses AES-256-CBC with (seemingly) no authentication, and the key derivation uses PBKDF2 with default iterations of 1000 and vague instructions on which value to choose. No interface to a memory-hard KDF is available.This, along with the notion of memory safety from untested C code doesn't really instill a sense of confidence in me...I would suggest throwing away all the cryptographic primitives you currently have and instead interface with libsodium, which is a library designed for the rest of us non-cryptographers.[1]: https://gliimly.github.io/encrypt-data.html

&lt;p&gt;The article explores a mother's perspective on raising her deaf daughter, emphasizing the importance of balancing both deaf and hearing cultures. The author reflects on her desire for her daughter to experience the richness of both worlds, highlighting the benefits of sign language and the deaf community while also recognizing the opportunities that come with accessing spoken language and hearing environments. She discusses the challenges and societal perceptions related to deafness, and advocates for her daughter’s ability to navigate both identities, allowing her to thrive and choose her own path.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the narrative around disabled people has advanced to the point where some now insist that they aren't disabled. In reality, it's a pretty objective fact that being disabled means being unable to do something. It is a net negative on someone's quality of life. I'd be jolly pissed off if my parent decided not to get me an implant that enabled me to hear just because someone had told them that being deaf was actually the same as being able to hear. Give the kid the hearing aid, and if they don't like it they can take it out later.There are plenty of things where this "different, not worse" narrative holds up. Children with autism or ADHD might struggle in some ways, but be better off in others. It seems clear that there is no objective reason they are worse than a neurotypical person, so if a "cure" to these conditions was developed, you would have some degree of moral quandary. But someone without hearing is just objectively worse off than someone with it, the same way someone without legs is worse off than someone with legs.The last part is what really gets me about this. The child values the hearing aid so highly that they literally hug it as they go to sleep, and this is somehow presented as a "both sides are right" outcome. To me at least, that's a pretty conclusive endorsement that kids should be given these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My wife and I faced a similar situation and found it a simple decision. We both carry GJB-2 gene mutations that will likely result in profound non-syndromic hearing loss. We went through Orchid Health to get a whole genome sequence of our prospective embryos and then selected one that was not affected by the condition.We have 1 more carrier girl and 2 more unaffected girls to work with, and if we want boys later in life we will probably wait for Decibel Therapeutics / Regeneron to finish their GJB-2 gene therapy before we have that child. If there are constraints then we will have a cochlear implant or simply not implant that embryo.It was obvious to us how it should play out. My wife and I have an obligation to maximize the cone of possibility for our children and a duty to equip them best to experience the world so that they can choose the path through it that they wish.Just like I would not pierce the eardrums of my child after she is born, I shall not intentionally choose an embryo that carries a debilitating condition that I cannot remedy or mitigate if I can choose otherwise. I don’t think this is a dilemma in any way. There is an obvious choice for us. We will not deny her normative sense organs. My parents got me glasses and contact lenses. My life would have been much less vibrant if they had chosen to not provide me those prosthetics.Some parents are not so fortunate as us to have this choice. I hope modern therapeutics will enable all children and adults to have the full range of sensors that most humans carry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm "almost" a lifelong user of a cochlear implant. I got my first one when I was 9. Before I got it, I was communicating through lip reading and speaking, I never knew sign language. Lip reading I still use relatively often -- when I'm at a crowded restaurant, or at an unbearably noisy party, and there's many interlocutors at the table, I persistently stare at their lips. They take me for a great listener, when in fact, I can't hear shit, and I'm desperately switching back and forth between people's mouths to catch what they're saying. I'm out of shape and this takes so much of my brain power to understand people that I often cannot contribute my thoughts.Though my cochlear isn't perfect, I would never think of not getting it. In fact, I'd probably be rather angry at my parents for not helping me get one as soon as it was possible. During my childhood and up until late college, I've only ever met one person who was so severely hard of hearing and was about my age, and that was where I have been getting my speech lessons before I got my first cochlear implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145935</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of viral cartography, exploring what elements contribute to maps becoming popular and widely shared online. It highlights factors such as aesthetics, storytelling, and relatability that make maps engaging to audiences. The piece also examines successful examples of viral maps and emphasizes the importance of creativity and design in effectively communicating geographic information, capturing the public's attention, and encouraging sharing across social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a map go viral in 2013, a map of US rivers. Here's the Daily Mail article about it, the apotheosis of virulence. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342083/The-veins-n...Two things made it go viral.1. Jason Kottke posted it to his weblog. Either you know about Kottke or you don't. Many journalists do. He's an authentic low-key tastemaker.2. I shared the map on Flickr with a CC by-SA license. Which meant any publication could republish it for free without even asking me.I'm still a little embarrassed about it. The map is pretty simple. The visualization is highly misleading and has all sorts of ugly visual artifacts. That Daily Mail article is full of mistakes (including misspelling my name three different ways.) The picture wasn't even really my goal, it was just a debugging workprint off my "real" project, a GitHub repo teaching people how to make maps in Javascript with vector tiles. But the picture looked cool and was easy to understand.But I'm also proud of the result. It did look cool! And the recognition pleased my vanity. If I wanted I could have landed several years of consulting work off the momentary fame, I had all sorts of requests for custom work based on it. My favorite outcome was the artist Tamsie River took the data, made a giant mold, and poured a hot iron cast of the Mississippi watershed. I'm still sorry I didn't go for the event. https://tamsie.com/River%20of%20Iron.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those looking for the travel time map:https://www.rome2rio.com/blog/2016/01/08/time-flies-accordin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:08:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098989</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of LawStar, a platform aimed at improving legal accessibility through technology. It highlights the challenges faced in the legal industry, such as inefficiencies and high costs, and emphasizes the importance of creating user-friendly tools for both legal professionals and clients. The author shares insights into the design process, functionalities, and the mission behind LawStar to empower users in navigating legal matters more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First mistake was trying to market to _students_Not sure how long this person has been out of school, but students are notoriously cheap. I’m not surprised there was no interest when monetizing/charging.Maybe a collab between law schools and including the tool there. Students get it “free” and you get paid by the law school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspiring story. TL;DR: Built a legal tech for students, tried selling for a while, didnt get a lot of traction and then ultimately sold the project to someone else.I think you did a lot of things the right way but probably went after a tough market. Students. Students are the most broke category and then comes indiehackers :). I would usually refrain from selling to these 2."A quick market-sizing exercise: there are ~110k law students in the US, ~25% of whom are in journals, and half of those are 2nd years. If I could penetrate even 10% of that market at $10/month, I’d be at $165k in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)"Haha. This is a classic newbie founder mistake thinking all you need is a % of the market. We all have made it. Now you know. Market estimate should be made bottom up, not top down."find the connectors"This is so key. If you are in a niche industry, finding the right connections who can open doors can be huge."Don't be a solo founder"As a solo founder (even though with a small team), I couldn't agree more. I know having  co-founders brings in risks of conflict etc but I am so ready to build a fresh team with cofounders who are thinking about the business 24-7 like I do. If you have a team like that and you work well together, that's a dream.Tell us more about your next thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't Zotero already do this?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Windows Memory-Mapped File I/O, explaining how it allows processes to share data efficiently and access files through memory addresses. It covers the benefits of using memory mapping for file operations, including improved performance and simplicity in accessing large files. The author provides code examples illustrating the use of relevant Windows API functions, such as `CreateFileMapping` and `MapViewOfFile`, and concludes with practical tips for implementing memory-mapped files in applications. Overall, it serves as a guide for developers looking to utilize this feature in Windows programming.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A memory mapped file can be used to store complex object oriented structures if you make use of 'relative' pointers, where you have to add the address of the pointer to the pointer to get to the object you are pointing to. I once used this method, to persist a complex data structure without having to write serialization code.A long time ago, I implemented some C++ classes that would hide most of the additional work and also took care of allocating new objects inside the memory mapped file. See: https://www.iwriteiam.nl/D0205.html#13MMF (Note that this implementation actually makes use of a slightly different approach where pointers are relative with respect to the first position of the file. This implementation has the limitation that you can only open one such store as a memory mapped file. It was only later I realized that it was possible to do without the offset. I never came to rewriting all the code.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you should be able to get rid of most of the undocumented API usage with the newer CreateFileMapping2/MapViewOfFile3 APIs. Though that does require a higher minimum OS version and the crucial NtExtendSection function still has no documented equivalent as far as I can tell, so it's kind of a wash.Also, you can link against ntdll.lib directly. Manually calling GetProcAddress for a few functions isn't a tragedy by any means, but in this case, why bother?Great article nonetheless!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 2022 libtorrent implemented memory mapped IO as part of v2 [1]. Unfortunately, it didn't go so well.  Memory usage went through the sky, leading to performance degradation and crashing [2]. The issue is still open in the project to this day, and many programs have stuck with the v1.2 library instead.It looks like they are headed to a multi-threaded pread implementation now [3] and someone has created a patch to tweak the current mmap fallback that uses pread to perform better in the meantime [4].[1] - https://www.libtorrent.org/upgrade_to_2.0-ref.html[2] - https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/6667[3] - https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/pull/7013[4] - https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pull/21300&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075278</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Eric Adams' office is directing New York City agencies to create accounts on the emerging social media platform Bluesky, encouraging officials to engage with the public as the platform gains popularity. This initiative aims to enhance communication and transparency between the government and citizens, as more people migrate from traditional platforms like Twitter to Bluesky. The move reflects the city's effort to stay current with digital trends and foster interaction in a changing social media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So soon, all the democrats will be on BlueSky and all the republicans will be on X/Twitter?Meanwhile us foreigners will have to maintain an account on both platforms to understand what our global overlords have decided for us today ;pAs an aside, my country has banned Twitter... yet everyone in the government, from the prime minister to the junior bureaucrat, uses twitter to issue announcements. They all use VPN. The whole thing is hilarious and sad. And I have to use VPN to find out if the road I'll go out yet is blocked or if we will have electricity today.Basically, the international market is unlikely to move to BlueSky, then again I could be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't care who owns it, social media is a cancer. Decentralized social media is actually worse because it fragments information, which makes it harder to access, harder to collaborate on, hides subtle knowledge, and creates further in-groups and echo chambers.What gets highlighted is almost never what is more intellectual, moral, factual, important, or curated. Instead it's whatever is entertaining, angering, scary, validating. It's a machine for capturing people's baser instincts and biases and weaponizing them to make people stupid and reactive.And it's designed to be addictive. This isn't even just the "big" social media sites. Anything with a "feed" or "endless scroll" is designed to hook you, keep you there, keep you engaging. Cigarettes may not be your drug of choice, but TikTok may be.Go ahead and quit social media. You know what people almost universally report? They feel calmer. Happier. Healthier. Less scared. They have more free time. It's a weight off their shoulders. Now imagine the opposite of all that, affecting nearly everyone connected to the internet. Imagine what that does over decades.This machine is eroding society. In the future, we're going to find out that social media was worse than cigarettes. The addictive habit that slowly destroys lives - even nations - over decades.I'm not the only person who has had friends have nervous breakdowns from social media. This is a pubic health emergency, but we're treating it like its politics. Politics is just a symptom of the greater disease: an epidemic of manipulation machines designed to ruin our health for clicks. The machine doesn't even know it's doing this to us. It's just doing what it was programmed to do. And we lap it up, like so many flies wandering into the fly trap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twitter at it's peak had less monthly active users than Facebook Stories.Outside of the journalist and media class, nobody used twitter. 300M+ people are a huge number, but barely scratches the surface in the Social Media world. What can bluesky do different to attract normies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:29 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143755</guid></item><item><title>46.

My guess is maybe there is, with some local LLM, but I’m just unaware of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:39 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42149580</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis, focusing on the roles of various components involved in the process. It highlights the importance of ribosomes, transfer RNA (tRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) in translating genetic information into proteins. The piece further delves into the different stages of translation, the regulation of these processes, and how errors in protein synthesis can lead to diseases. Overall, it provides an in-depth overview of the intricacies of protein synthesis and its significance in cellular function.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In his 1976 essay on (or against) genetic engineering [1] Erwin Chargaff wrote "But screams and empty promises fill the air: Don't you want cheap insulin? (...) And how about a green man synthesizing his nourishment: 10 minutes in the sun for breakfast, 30 minutes for lunch, and 1 hour for dinner?" Nice to see that scientists are actually trying.[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.11643312&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unfortunately to meet animal energy requirements one would need a huge canopy; it'd probably only be feasible outside our gravity well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always imagined this as a future basic genetic modification with a gene trigger: before starvation sets in your cells would manufacture a bunch of chloroplasts and turn your skin green, to give you a chance with water and sunlight to get some more run way on survival. Then if your calorie levels rise the chloroplasts get re-absorbed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:49 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42108663</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of Costco's recent butter recall, highlighting the importance of accurate labeling and safety standards in the food industry. It details how the recall stemmed from mislabeling that could potentially lead to allergic reactions among consumers. The piece emphasizes the high stakes involved for retailers like Costco, including potential legal repercussions, damage to consumer trust, and financial impacts. It also explores the broader context of food safety and regulatory challenges, underlining the critical role of transparency in food labeling practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get that this seems like an overreach, but America is incredibly safe for people with allergies and it's because of enforcement like this. In my 36 years of being alive, I've never once had an allergic reaction in the US due to mislabeling (although I've had them in South America and Asia).Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, there's 8 groups that MUST be labeled: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans.Everyone with an allergy knows to check that section of the packaging (it comes after the long list of ingredients), and you can trust it to be accurate. It can't just be right most of the time... it has to always be right.If that trust is broken, America will be a much less safe place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of the HN comments in this thread said,"America can simultaneously be the safest place on earth for those with food allergies, while avoiding this kind of bureaucratic nonsense.""I get that this seems like an overreach, but America is incredibly safe for people with allergies and it's because of enforcement like this."In my 40+ years of life in India, and among the many people that I've seen or interacted with in 5 Indian states (among 28 States), I've rarely heard someone say they have allergies the way they have in the US. In US, people have allergies to almost everything.In my 40+ years of life in India, and based on the various supermarkets that I've visited across 4 heavily crowded metro cities, I've rarely seen "Allergy" medicines/prescriptions occupy the shelf like they do in the US.Also in the same period of my existence in this third world country, I've rarely seen people concerned about the ingredients in a restaurant menu or labels printed on food packets or containers that there are allergy causing ingredients in there.Like George Bush once cruelly remarked, "India is the cause of shortage of food in the world", because we eat everything, and rarely check the labels or need them, or less allergic to any food. We are just short of food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real problem here is that the FDA is recommending throwing out the butter purely based on the labels.If they said, "throw out the butter if you (or whomever would have consumed it) have an allergy to milk as this is dairy milk-based butter", or if Costco said, "return it because it was not clear this was a dairy based butter" it would make more sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:09:59 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42150991</guid></item><item><title>49. SQL style guide by Simon Holywell</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143528</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The SQL Style Guide is a comprehensive resource designed to promote best practices for writing SQL code. It offers guidelines on various aspects of SQL syntax, including formatting, naming conventions, and query organization, emphasizing readability and maintainability. The guide covers topics such as capitalization of keywords, use of punctuation, structuring joins and subqueries, and provides practical examples to illustrate these principles. Overall, it aims to help developers write clean, consistent, and efficient SQL code that is easy to understand and modify.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Spaces should be used to line up the code so that the root keywords all end on the same character boundary.  SELECT file_hash
    FROM file_system
   WHERE file_name = '.vimrc';

This style is annoying and I wish it gained less traction. It looks neat but it puts so much burden on the query writer, especially when you modify the query and all of the sudden you need to indent multiple lines just to make them all align. You know what's neat and still easy to modify/diff? Just indent a new line for each row.    SELECT
        file_hash
    FROM
        file_system
    WHERE
        file_name = '.vimrc';&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think my #1 rule for SQL these days is to abuse common table expressions as much as possible. No amount of whitespace cleanliness can compensate for a poorly organized problem. There is (in my mind) no longer an excuse for trying to join 10+ tables all at once in a single heroic attempt. Decompose the problem and let the query planner figure that shit out for you, just as you would with a compiler and code.With CTEs you can offload sophisticated joins and constraints in such a way that less experienced developers can follow behind more easily.Once you find multiple queries using the same WITH clauses, you can create more permanent views that further centralize and optimize these concerns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Try to only use standard SQL functions instead of vendor-specific functions for reasons of portability.Hard disagree here. "Let's do/not do this, in case we decide to change databases in the future" is one of the greatest lies we tell ourselves. You're just making your life harder now and in the near future, for the nebulous promise of "seamlessly replacing your database backend if needed".In 95% of cases, it's not needed, and you're getting all of the downsides for no benefit. And if it's needed in a late stage of your application's life, changing a bunch of SQL functions will be just one tiny problem among many bigger ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:09 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143528</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of bootstrapping Alpine Linux in a non-root environment, focusing on how to set up a minimal system without requiring root access. It provides a step-by-step guide detailing the preparation of a working directory, the installation of necessary packages, and the configuration of the environment. The author highlights the advantages of Alpine Linux, such as its lightweight design and security features, and emphasizes the challenges and solutions encountered during the bootstrapping process, making it accessible for users looking to experiment with Alpine Linux in constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can rip a rootfs from a docker image using skopeo[1] and undocker[2] then you can puppeteer it with bwrap[3].This works for most linux distributions (they behave well as fakeroot puppets).
Package managers from Debian-based distros tend to misbehave in bwrap in my experience.I use this method to obtain software from various distro repositories or when RPM packages are distributed by vendors.[1] &lt;https://github.com/containers/skopeo&gt;[2] &lt;https://git.jakstys.lt/motiejus/undocker&gt;[3] &lt;https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Creating a chroot in Linux is pretty easy: put a rootfs in a folder and run the sudo chroot /my/folder command. But what if you don't want to use superuser privileges for this?My very first thought is actually proot ( https://proot-me.github.io/ ), though that does have a performance hit.That said, once you're using unshare (which is a good idea), why not just use podman? Mostly the same under the hood, but does a bunch of this for you. And for this exact usecase I appreciate that there are tradeoffs but I personally would have built pmbootstrap out of Dockerfiles in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What about user-mode Linux containers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 04:10:19 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107146</guid></item></channel></rss>
