            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037386'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a decent amount of cynicism in the comments, which I understand. I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.Historically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).The last couple of decades we've seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).This mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.The method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.The whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of this stuff is promising, and I hope the diagnostic side catches up as well.Just went to a funeral this weekend for a 40 year old who died of breast cancer 4 weeks after diagnosis at her first annual mammogram.A lot of skeptical people under 30 here haven't lived through regularly various cancer diagnoses in their friends &amp; family group that your late 30s/early 40s starts to bring.I don't have the data on it, but anecdotally I notice that women's cancers seem to strike 5-10 years earlier than mens even if they can be caught early &amp; treated well.. Though apparently men have overall worse cancer survival rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Same as mountainriver's comment. I really find strange how I've been reading news lines over the past years about great advancements in many incurable and chronic diseases (like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancers) yet after all that time people's treatment is not going any better. I'm not sure whether scientific journalism somehow delivered some unintended messages to me, or we're just supposed to experience these great advancements after couple of decades from the announcement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037386</guid></item><item><title>2.

The sticking points in recent days were over whether they could get a “just cause” provision in their contract, which means workers can be terminated only for misconduct or another such reason; pay increases and pay equity; and return-to-office policies.This seems like a LOT of issues that still need to be hammered out. It would be one thing if they were disagreeing about a number, but it sounds like the terms keep changing and nobody agrees on the nature of the work itself. It's not even clear that there's a preliminary contract ready for the NYTimes to sign.Striking during election week is kind of a crappy move to pull. But if this is just attention seeking without a serious contract, it seems egregiously risky on behalf of the union members too: there's not a clear button the Times can push on behalf of the union to end the strike immediately. The Times would either have to sign a blank check to the union now, or the union would have to agree to an IOU in exchange for a bunch of temporary concessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gift link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/business/media/new-york-t...https://archive.ph/f9gP0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42040795</guid></item><item><title>3.

If they can't do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.Agreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart's law. [0]In the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.Consequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won't use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They'll only use those dashboards.Which then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.Helping a colleague doesn't show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn't on the sprint board? Fuck that.Which is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.And then, because this is the work reality you've created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you're left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked on an internal platform for a large engineering org and was responsible for choosing what features we put in.We had the technical means to track everything from commits to reviews, jiras, deploys, etc. Some of our most celebrated and impactful features were reporting on Accelerate metrics and related. E.g. deploy frequency, size of changes, duration of stages in the dev cycle and such.I set a very inflexible red line: we don’t expose data more granular than at team level. Ever. No excuse.Quite a few line managers would come to me asking for “personal metrics”, and even engineers in the team were super interested in building that (“with all this data we could…”).My argument was that these metrics are toxic and invite misuse. A second factor was that this misuse would generate mistrust from engs against the platform and damage adoption.Instrumenting an organization thought of as a system is fine. You want to see where are bottlenecks, you want to have measurable targets for how technical work is done and how it correlates to business goals/KPIs.You want to offer teams metrics of their delivery my process so they can take the info and implement improvements whenever they see fit, and have a data driven conversation with the business (e.g. about the right setting for the carefulness knob)But teams are the minimum unit of ownership, we stop the instrumentation there. Sure, a team’s performance ultimately links to individuals, but that is the manager’s job to figure out.Interestingly:* only line managers asked for this info, nobody in a director/vp/cxo role
* the most annoyed by me saying no were engineers in the team who wanted to do these features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there's a scene from the tv show "suits" that has always stuck with me:the show is set in a law firm, and in this particular episode they needed to lay off some of their associates. a young, newly-promoted lawyer was tasked with drawing up a list of the associates and marking the ones who she felt should get the axe, based on their performance. so she comes up with some metrics, goes through the associates' work, and ranks them based on the resultant numbers, saying that the bottom few could be let go.there is one employee, brian, who ends up near the bottom of the list. a more senior person takes her aside and asks why she recommended brian be laid off, so she brings out the metrics and rankings and points to him near the bottom. the senior person asks "okay, so who are the top associates in your list? can you point them out on the seating chart?". turns out, the top five associates were all brian's neighbours, and the reason was that he was really good at helping people when they were stuck with something. but of course that affected his own individual contributor numbers, and there were no metrics for "helped someone else out but didn't get credit for it".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:55 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42038653</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing hertz-dev, the first open-source base model for conversational audio generation. A convolutional audio autoencoder that takes mono, 16kHz speech and transforms it into a 8 Hz latent representation at about 1kbps bitrate. The model has a context of 8192 sampled latent representations (17 minutes) and predicts the next encoded audio frame. We're excited to announce that we're open-sourcing current checkpoints of our full-duplex, audio-only transformer base model.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036995'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool. FWIW, existing open-source TTS engines are really bad in comparison to what you have here: I know this is voice-to-voice, but I think there'd be a lot of appetite to get this to also be multimodal and accept text (essentially making it a really good TTS model, in addition to a great voice-to-voice model).I suppose someone could hack their way around the problem by finetuning it to essentially replay Piper (or whatever) output, only with more natural prosody and intonation. And then have the text LLM pipe to Piper, and Piper pipe to Hertz-dev. But it would be pretty useful to have it accept text natively!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They say Hertz is first of its kind but Moshi is another duplex audio model from earlier this year that seems to perform similarly (and it runs on a MacBook):
https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla’s approach to pure vision-based autonomous driving—temporarily setting aside lidar and other sensors—seems designed to make this technology more accessible and scalable. By focusing on a vision-only model, they can accelerate adoption and gather large datasets for quicker iterations. Once the vision-based system reaches a mature stage, I imagine Tesla might reintegrate additional sensor data, like lidar or radar, to refine their autonomous driving suite, making it even more robust and closer to perfection.Additionally, I’ve been exploring an idea about voice interaction systems. Currently, most voice interactions are processed by converting voice input into text, generating a text-based response, and then turning this text back into audio. But what if we could train the system to respond directly in voice, without involving text at all? If developed to maturity, this model could produce responses that feel more natural and spontaneous, possibly diverging from traditional text-to-speech outputs. Natural speech has unique syntax and rhythm, not to mention dialect and tone variations, which could make a purely voice-trained system fascinating and more human-like.Could you let me know if your current voice interaction model follows the standard speech-to-text-to-speech process, or if there is exploration in voice-to-voice processing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036995</guid></item><item><title>5.

Lisp usually prefers expressive names over terse Greek letters, but lambda is an exception. A better name would be make-function. Lambda derives from the notation in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, which used a caret over bound variables: x̂(x + x). Church wanted a one-dimensional string, so he moved the caret in front: ^x(x + x). The caret looked funny with nothing below it, so Church switched to the closest thing, an uppercase lambda, Λx(x + x) . The Λ was easily confused with other symbols, so eventually the lowercase lambda was substituted: λx(x + x). John McCarthy was a student of Church's at Princeton, so when McCarthy invented Lisp in 1958, he adopted the lambda notation. There were no Greek letters on the keypunches of that era, so McCarthy used (lambda (x) (+ x x)), and it has survived to this day.So, yes, on the topic of this post - Church pops up in loads of Lisp retrospectives. Maybe he's "forgotten" by people with very little engagement in the history of computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Church’s lambda calculus and the Turing machine are equally powerful but differ in the fact that Turing machines use mutable state. To this day, there is a rift between functional and imperative programming languages, because of the separation of Church and state."[I have known the above quote forever, but I can't find an original source]edit: might be from Guy Steele: "And some people prefer not to commingle the functional, lambda-calculus part of a
language with the parts that do side effects. It seems they believe in the separation of Church and state"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to read something incredible about Church, read Rota's reminiscence.

A bit of British political trivia: Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of the Vote Leave organisation in the 2016 Brexit referendum, nicked the NeXT logo and made a few tweaks for Vote Leave:&gt; The logo was stolen from Steve Jobs. We couldn’t afford to hire a top agency and they wouldn’t have worked with us anyway. So I thought about Jobs’ advice on simplicity and ‘the best artists steal’ (see above!) and did some google searches. Surely there’s something he did with manic determination I could steal? After he left Apple in the 1980s, for his new company he got one of the top designers in the world to do a logo. I looked at it and thought, ‘good enough for Steve good enough for us, we can put a hole in the top so it looks like a ballot box’. Total cost: almost nothing. I made a lot of decisions like this because the savings in time and money were far greater than the marginal improvements of spending more time and money on them (if this would even bring an improvement).https://dominiccummings.substack.com/i/117842715/where-did-t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always go back to the Saul Bass presentation to AT&amp;T over their 1970 logo redesign. He takes 30 minutes to explain the thought process and sell this design hard. By the end you're convinced it's the natural thing to do. I'm sure every executive in the room felt the same way.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKu2de0yCJI(Bass would return a mere 13 years later to do the AT&amp;T "Death Star" logo after the breakup)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Set in all capitals, the word NEXT is sometimes confused with EXIT possibly because the EXT grouping is so dominant. A combination of capitals and lower case letters alleviates this problem.Huh. Never knew why the 'e' was lowercased until now. I thought it was just "style".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42042382</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037982'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In short: their finding is that quantizing a model undoes various “unlearning” methods. An unlearning method is a specific update to model weights that make it forget specific facts. These are often meant to satisfy copyright claims, although I don’t know if these are ever used in practice.I feel that this needs a good threat model analysis. Like, you possess an fp32 model, which someone has fine-tuned to forget some facts, which you can then quantize to recover those facts. When would this lead to a dangerous situation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think quantization is a red herring. If there's any way to undo the unlearning, this means that the knowledge is still in the weights -- that's basic information theory. I'm sure there are a million other ways to recover the lost knowledge that don't involve quantization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's like asking baby to unlearn something "bad" it learned. Pretty much guaranteed the knowledge will be reinforced rather than forgotten.Whenever I hear about AI craze, I remind myself of the 3D printers craze from 10-15 years ago. "Death blow to factories", "We will print our own cars", "We will print our own food". I imagine LLM AI will follow the same fate - yes, but not really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037982</guid></item><item><title>8.

This and competing apps let you set requirements (kcal, intolerances, etc), also includes breakfast, etc. These apps are aimed at people that want to eat healthy and are looking for some inspiration.You seem to go with user generated content, so the inspiration part is out, the health part is out, but you focus very much on the problem of forming a choice just for diner.I do think this way your audience is huge, but the added value is a bit limited.So you can decide to slowly move towards those other apps. Or, perhaps move away from it somehow. Maybe it's a generic tool to help you grow and maitain your relationship with your partner by providing tools that deal with each other preferences and choices within that relationship. Both practical and more emotional. But I guess I'm now more brainstorming :).You can also just keep it small and have fun tinkering in a way that works for you. I read a comment:&gt; There are servers needed for the app to work, right? So I guess subscription makes sense?Perhaps you don't really need servers. Keep the data just local on the app. Let people use regular chat for getting to a compromise. That way you could ask a one time fee of $5. It could be a (very) small passive income that doesn't require you much work, no moderation, no security risks.Either way, good luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea and face the same challenge. I’ve just installed it and, from my first impressions, it seemed a bit basic. Here’s what I expected:Hundreds of recipes that I could swipe left and right through, allowing me to build up a typical selection of what I would usually eat. Instead, I was presented with only three choices, none of which I would generally consider.A simple way to send the code to my wife — via imessage, Telegram, etc. Instead, I had to tell her in person! :)This presents the perfect opportunity to delve into shopping lists where the wife wants something healthy, and the I crave a burger. I can think of quite a few features you could add if the app develops further.Also, like the comment below about having a stranger over for dinner (not for dating purposes), it could involve a couple or someone visiting a new country who would appreciate a local showing them around and perhaps covering the dinner cost. Once the app learns your food preferences and interests, that could be quite exciting! There might already be an app that does this; I’m not sure.  Swiping left and right on both food likes / dislikes and also general interests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why not both? See what others around you want to eat, swipe together, meet up with a stranger in a restaurant and eat together. Maybe get to know them, maybe not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036041</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security in Go code can be achieved by following a few specific practices. These practices will lead to writing robust, secure and performant code. The best way to stay informed about Go security announcements is to subscribe to the [email protected] list. The go vet command without arguments runs the tool with all options allowed by default. The tool scans the source code and reports potential issues. It also enforces Go language styling and suggests corrections with running staticcheck in the CI pipeline, we can install the code locally as a standalone binary.&lt;/p&gt;

I find that so awesome. (And I know, someone is going to point out that hipster language foo does this too and better — it’s not the norm).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget about capslock: https://github.com/google/capslockAssess your 3P modules for dangerous capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great tips in here - I was not aware of `go vet` nor `go test -race`.FWIW, while go is not memory safe, I do find that it's much easier to be safe in go than it is in other languages. Its verboseness lends to a very clear understanding of what's happening in any given function. I absolutely hated this at the start, but now ~3 years into maintaining a go codebase, I find it quite nice both for debugging as well as editing old code. I know exactly what each function does, and what the structure of data is in any given context.Another interesting side effect is that AI tools seem to work amazingly well with golang, given how context is often local to the function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:55 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043939</guid></item><item><title>10.

I am a very big fan of the albums he produced, such as “The Dude” and “Back on the Block.”What is less well known is Quincy Jones’ involvement with computing.  At one point he was on the advisory committee for the ACM Computers in Entertainment Magazine (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/973801.973803), and if I remember correctly, he was on the board of former Xerox PARC researcher Alan Kay’s Viewpoints Research Institute.  I’ve been wanting to know more about Quincy Jones’ involvement with computing since I first learned about this a few years ago.Rest in peace.  Quincy Jones is a legendary figure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was four, I got a record player for Christmas. This one:https://djcj.website/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/denim_turnta...My mom had a copy of Ray Charles' greatest hits. My favorite song was One Mint Julep. Quincy Jones did the arrangement. You can see by the wear on this record how much I listened to that song, as well as "Unchain My Heart" and "Hit the Road Jack."https://djcj.website/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/one-mint-jul...So much great music. And when you watch interviews with other musicians with whom he crossed paths, they all talk about what an uplifting and positive influence he had on their lives.Here's a interview with his longtime collaborator Tom Bähler. He has some really beautiful stories about his experiences with Quincy.https://youtu.be/yIkP_XuIDeY?t=5197And when he got together with Rod Temperton, the magic was next-level.https://www.facebook.com/QuincyJones/posts/ill-never-forget-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;*From a strictly musical perspective, what have you done that you’re most proud of?*That anything I can feel, I can notate musically. Not many people can do that. I can make a band play like a singer sings. That’s what arranging is, and it’s a great gift. I wouldn’t trade it for shit.https://www.vulture.com/article/quincy-jones-in-conversation...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039569</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams lets you draw the cloud system architecture in Python code. It was born for prototyping a new system architecture without any design tools. Diagram as Code allows you to track the architecture diagram changes in any version control system. It currently supports main major providers including: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud etc... It also supports On-Premise nodes, SaaS and major Programming frameworks and languages.NOTE: It does not control any actual cloud resources nor does it generate cloud formation or terraform code.&lt;/p&gt;

It'll play nice in VCS. Maybe I can interrogate orchestration layers and so on to produce dynamic views.In practice diagrams are produced by folks who might not want to use or learn python [or golang, their other implementation]. Instead a lean purpose-build DSL, maybe even an extension of graphviz dot, is easier and more portable for some audiences to pick up.
Secondly, we can't JUST graft a DSL front-end onto these tools because the styled components are baked into the project.My personal experience with layout engines is that they work OK for very small architecture diagrams, but become ugly or inelegant at useful scales.I (and the teams I've worked with) settle on draw.io, either the desktop app, or committed as part of confluence, as the best way to describe intent/design - and rendering graphviz with a style up top for anything dynamic.Would welcome seeing a true extension to the dot language that can unlock reasoning engines (like to do threat modeling) and render-time styling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally have been using mermaid for sequence diagrams and flow charts: https://mermaid.js.org/DaC seems nicer for infra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044771</guid></item><item><title>12.

The HP50g that came much later is better in every respect, except possibly for the smaller "ENTER" key (and people used to 48G will have to change some habits and possibly redefine some keys…).Incidentally, many young people (yes, I know how that sounds) do not know how useful a good engineering calculator can be and do not want to learn how to use one. They are missing out. Yes, there is a steep learning curve, but the rewards are significant if you do any amount of calculation in your hobby or work. No, this is not replaced by typing "python" (or "bc", or anything else, really) at your command prompt.Also incidentally, the development of good engineering calculators pretty much died. HP Prime is largely a school-pleasing toy, HP would down their calculator division a long time ago, and nobody else produces anything good. It's kind of like with gyms: what you get is what the market wants, and since the market doesn't know much, you get gyms full of useless exercise machines, because that's what people think a good gym should have. Similarly with calculators: you get stupid "modern" graphing calculators which are useless for actual work (it takes forever to use them to calculate useful things, and graphing is much better done on a computer), but they look great and sell well.I admire the project, although I would probably have taken a different path (emulation) to get the biggest effect with the smallest possible effort :-)I wish there was a good HP50G emulator for iOS — there used to be one, but it was abandoned (contact me if you want to develop it and would like to get the source code, it was under the GPL and I got it from the author).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a fan of the HP Primehttps://hpcalcs.com/product/hp-prime-graphing-calculator/But I use it in algebraic instead of RPN mode.  I’ve got a 49g and a 50-something too.People say it is pricey but I managed to get one discounted that was intended for the Latin American market.  So is the thing that software is supposed to run on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still have a HP48GX in perfect condition and love it. One of my first programs was to calculate how much „slower“ my time is running when I drive a car or fly in a plane compared to someone standing still on the sidewalk.I still find it much more comfortable having a real calculator… call me old fashioned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043747</guid></item><item><title>13.

That is, a sequence XYZ that you can perform repeatedly and have that bring you through every cube state.  If not, maybe there is some other very simple algorithm that traverses all the states, instead of a zip file that uncompresses to 200MB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bit of a meta note: grown adult here who never got into cubing earlier in life. Recently picked one up as some non-screen entertainment for some long haul flights and train travel.

For such an important document or source, nothing is known about it. Its existence is not mentioned or hinted at in external sources. No trace of it has been found.In addition, the synoptic puzzle can be laid in a self-consistent and "path-of-least-resistance way" by looking at e.g. author motives: Matthew writing for the Jewish community in Jerusalem; Mark describing Peter's preaching in Rome; Luke writing as a Greek doctor for a gentile audience (and John writing much later, clarifying and responding to the first heresies that had popped up).So the Q hypothesis, aside from being a purely theoretical construction based on internal evidence, is not necessary either.See e.g. "Case Against Q: Studies in Markan Priority and the Synoptic Problem" by Goodacre.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of odd to see this turning up here:  this theory isn't new and in fact is one of the couple most accepted theories about the origin of the gospels.  It was proposed more than a century ago, and this article doesn't say anything particularly new or interesting about it.  Honestly, the Wikipedia page is probably better:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The Farrer hypothesis proposes that Matthew used Mark as a source, but Luke used both Mark and Matthew as a source. This approach is simple and negates the need for a Q source altogether.&gt; A weakness of the Q source hypothesis is the absence of any textual evidence despite extensive scholarly efforts to find it. The entire hypothesis is based on statistical and literary analysis and inference. It adds complexity to the synoptic problem by introducing an additional layer of tradition, transmission, and composition, which may not be warranted given the available evidence (or rather lack thereof).Wouldn't Occam's Razor suggest that the Farrer hypothesis is most likely true?Edit: Or, maybe I should just continue reading to the end first:&gt; On the other hand, it would also make for a more complex explanation than other scholars have proposed, violating the principle of Occam’s Razor. Alternatively, Mark could have been the source for Matthew, and Matthew for Luke, which is a much simpler explanation than the Q hypothesis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42040706</guid></item><item><title>15.

It doesn't change the fact that it won't be happening though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California is in the middle of a huge fire insurance crisis. It started with the intentional housing supply restrictions that drove up property prices and rents. In suburban areas, rebuilding costs were mostly increased indirectly through higher wages (as tradespeople and laborers have to make rent.) This sent insurance rates through the roof and caused a wave of policy cancellations. Many insurance companies exited the market altogether [1].Climate change is also to blame. The firestorms of 2017, 2018 and 2020 broke all records, and were insanely expensive to rebuild after. The typical trigger is a katabatic wind event [2] after a long dry spell. This massively reduces relative humidity (often to 5-10%,) making ignition much easier. Once a fire starts, the wind spreads it extremely quickly. Sustained wind speeds of 50-60mph are not uncommon near mountain peaks.In 2017/2018/2020, the precipitating events were so intense that the initial responses focused exclusively on helping the residents out. By the time the actual firefighting began, the fires were already enormous.It's surprising to me that we haven't seriously looked into large-scale sprinkler systems, such as this one deployed in Spain [3]. These could take a major bite out of the initial uncontrolled stage. They could either be deployed in the wild along naturally defensible lines, or at the perimeters of inhabited areas.They're expensive upfront, but not as expensive as the alternative. They might also reduce the need for prescribed burns.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/10/home...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind[3] https://www.wired.com/story/spanish-wildfire-defenses/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slight tangent, USFS has been using outdated models for their prescribed burns, and burned as late as July in my area, right at the beginning of fire season and months away from any expected precipitation. This turned into a big wildfire in my area and they spent ~$100m putting it out. You may have been able to get away with burning during the summer in the 90's here, but not anymore.I'm not opposed to prescribed burns, either, I think they are totally necessary. But do them in the fall, when you've got nothing but rain and cool temperatures for the next 6 months, instead of weeks before the hottest and driest stretch of the year.As to why they burn in early summer, they said at a community meeting it's because it requires fewer people to manage the fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42046596</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year saw a lot of research consolidation, with continued progress along well-established lines. New techniques have opened up avenues of understanding kinship from ancient populations and the links between people and artifacts. Balancing selection can be a result of overdominance, where the relative fitness of an allele declines when the allele becomes very common, or balancing selection can happen when an allele has varied fitnesses in different times and places. Many fascinating questions about ancient people involve their social dynamics and their interaction with other ancient groups.&lt;/p&gt;

Neandertals, on the other hand, had a much lower response for the missense variants which were found in these genes.I struggle to interpret this (not least because of the mis- prefix: does this mean incorrectly sensing? Does spicy in scent mean something that would map to food spices?) But does it mean that Denisovans would have disliked things we think of as smelling bad, far more than Neanderthals would? Would a Denisovan have bathed more for personal hygiene, or have avoided spicy food, or...? Would a Denisovan today have a strong aversion to some perfumes or colognes (the ones with woody, tobacco, musk scents)?There is this vague sense of wonder that there were human populations with preferences that were _different_ to our own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s impressive how ancient DNA maps our origins though it feels like piecing together a story with missing chapters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42033913</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes seems like the obvious choice for building out remote, standardized and automated development environments. But Gitpod has found that Kubernetes is not the right choice. This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud. The many gigabytes of source code, build caches, Docker container and test data are subject to a high change rate and costly to migrate. Unlike many production services, there’s a 1-to-1 interaction between the developer and their environment. We found that many teams underestimate the complexity of operating a CDE.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42041917'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally - just let the developer own the machine they use for development.If you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.I have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.Yes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).Yes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).Yes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.---The only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.If you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is not a story of whether or not to use Kubernetes for production workloads that’s a whole separate conversation. As is the topic of how to build a comprehensive soup-to-nuts developer experience for shipping applications on Kubernetes.&gt; This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud.I'd like to request that the comment thread not turn into a bunch of generic k8s complaints. This is a legitimately interesting article about complicated engineering trade-offs faced by an organization with a very unique workload. Let's talk about that instead of talking about the title!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  &gt;Kubernetes seems like the obvious choice for building out remote, standardized and automated development environments

- Is it really Obvious Choice™ though Fred?- Hmm, let's consult the graphs.  &gt;Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for automating software deployment.

- It's about automating deployment Carl, not development environments!  &gt;Kubernetes is not the right choice for building development environments, as we’ve found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42041917</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039053'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned this in my very first corporate job at Factset and it made me sick of them; it's the main reason why I've worked at a bunch of startups.If the manager likes you, they will see the things you do in a positive light.If the manager doesn't like you, they will see the things you do in a negative light.So obviously, the solution is to optimize for always keeping the manager happy... except that that is a little dehumanizing.It's basically like any relationship coupled with confirmation bias. Basically, if you get onto the shit-list of your partner or friend or manager, it is difficult to get off it. People seem to automatically polarize their opinions about other people (probably due to confirmation bias) and then just apply post-hoc justification.If nothing else, I have gotten very good at noticing the change of tone when the point-of-no-return is reached (perhaps because I feel like I am terrible at avoiding it). You'll feel some queasiness/nausea after a conversation that went from friendly to critical based on something you perhaps flubbed... you'll start blaming yourself (even though you probably didn't actually have a ton of control over the outcome). Something will feel "off." Things won't feel as harmonious anymore. Details will be off- you didn't get invited to an important meeting that you are pretty sure you would have been invited to months prior. A new hire will get approved, but without anyone checking in with you first. You will feel like you are on the defensive and are working "defensively"- you're struggling to complete work or put presentations together or whatever- you're not sleeping well- those are all the feel of the ring ropes against your back, because you're actually on them, and you're in denial. It's hard not to take personally; has anyone actually ever been put on a PIP that made it back to "stellar performer", or are PIPs purely just lip-service to a CYA for the inevitable layoff?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; If you take nothing else away from this post, take this: a sufficiently skilled manager can take the same body of work and make it work for you OR against you.This is pretty much the only thing that matters (unless you are really at one of the far extremes of the ability bell curve).&gt;&gt;About a year ago, I finally came to the conclusion that I would not put anything on a performance review writeup for a coworker that could ever be used against them.When I was a contractor, I was occasionally asked for feedback from permanent employee managers. As if I would say anything bad, even if I hated them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perf reviews are a terrible abstraction. The ranking and self-scoring and meetings and goal setting and stomach aching could be boiled down to a 5 item list:1. We want this person to leave. They probably should have been let go already.2. We wouldn't mind if this person left, but we aren't going to go out of our way until there are layoffs.3. This person provides adequate value, loyalty, and flexibility for their salary.4. This person is a key contributor and should be advanced if possible.5. We don't know why this person is still here, and we are terrified they might leave us when they realize how undercompensated they are.That's it. That's all perf reviews are for. No one needs to be stack ranked or anything silly like that. HR is an abomination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039053</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents the methodology for creating a cost-efficient radio astronomy telescope that can be used to detect 21 cm emissions. By measuring the Doppler shifts of the 21 cm emission, the velocities of hydrogen clouds relative to Earth can be determined. This enables the identification of these clouds' movements, their positions within the galaxy's spiral arms, and their roles in the overall rotational dynamics of the Milky Way. The setup is designed to be accessible to amateurs, enabling others to conduct similar projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Looked like #1. The dish splits into segments, and I recall driving down the M1 from Birmingham in my battered old Ford Escort, with the (razor-sharp) mesh segments squeezed in and wobbling right next to my jugular... Those dishes were getting vanishingly hard to find in the UK, so it was worth the trip, and I kept my neck intact with only minimal damage...I had it all packed up when moving out to the US (because my imagination told me that houses in the US were far larger than in the UK). The house I ended up buying (despite having a much larger back garden) didn't have the space to set it up again and remain married, so two decades later, it's still in that wooden case... I do, however, have an optical telescope set up (#2)Back then, we didn't have easy access to SDR's, so there's a feed horn, a down-converter, and I had an external (standalone) WinRadio receiver to  actually listen to the feed. That went into an audio card on a linux box, and the waterfall display was beautiful :)#1: https://imgur.com/a/CDrEeII#2: https://imgur.com/a/askar-130phq-scope-sb-myt-mount-26mp-cam...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some pics of the OG detector from the 50s https://www.radio-astronomy.org/node/368The Purcell mentioned is the same one of NMR Nobel and E&amp;M textbook fame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page three of the paper shows an enviable rooftop antenna farm. Drool.I have an ignorant question ... can home/amateur radio astronomy ever produce layperson-appreciated "imagery"? Something easily understood like optical astronomy can produce? e.g. stitching together a sky scan for a particular emission or something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044494</guid></item><item><title>21.

I suspect we get the same variability just by going from one kernel version to another. The impact from all the Intel mitigations that are now enabled by default is much worse.However I do care about nice  profiles and stack traces without having to jump through hoops.Asking people to recompile an _entire_ distribution just to get sane defaults is wrong. Those who care about the last drop should build their custom systems as they see fit, and they probably already do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added support to Sysprof this weekend for unwinding using libdwfl and DWARF/CFI/eh_frame/etc techniques that Serhei did in eu-stacktrace.The overhead is about 10% of samples. But at least you can unwind on systems without frame-pointers. Personally I'll take the statistical anomalies of frame-pointers which still allow you to know what PID/TID are your cost center even if you don't get perfect unwinds. Everyone seems motivated towards SFrame going forward, which is good.https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2024/11/03/profiling-w-o-fr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I broadly agree with the thesis of the post, which if I understand correctly is that frame pointers are a temporary compromise until the whole ecosystem gets its act together and manages to agree on some form of out-of-band tracking of frame pointers, and it seems that we'll eventually get there.Some of the statements in the post seem odd to me though.- 5% of system-wide cycles spent in function prologues/epilogues? That is wild, it can't be right.- Is using the whole 8 bytes right for the estimate? Pushing the stack pointer is the first instruction in the prologue and it's literally 1 byte. Epilogue is symmetrical.- Even if we're in the prologue, we know that we're in a leaf call, we can still resolve the instruction pointer to the function, and we can read the return address to find the parent, so what information is lost?When it comes to future alternatives, while frame pointers have their own problems, I think that there are still a few open questions:- Shadow stacks are cool but aren't they limited to a fixed number of entries? What if you have a deeper stack?- Is the memory overhead of lookup tables for very large programs acceptable?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:55 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42040549</guid></item><item><title>22.

So the country bands were aware of the new style of jazz but most people had never actually heard any and had to play what they imagined jazz to be, mostly based off verbal descriptions. I remember this record as a crazy sound, but brilliantly entertaining.Unfortunately I can't point you to the song or the interview, but if anyone else can please reply :-0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crumb has been living in a small village in the south of France since the 90's.In the "Crumb" doc he says something along "They're all wearing baseball hats. I'm getting out of here.", speaking about the US.He also laments having taken too much LSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intro about him not liking the music reminded me of the Letter of Note entry when Crumb is sent an experimental jazz album and replies to the musician:https://lettersofnote.com/2015/12/17/torturing-the-saxophone...&gt; I gotta tell you, on the cover of the CD of your sax playing, which is black and has no text on it, I wrote in large block letters, in silver ink, “Torturing The saxophone—Mats Gustafsson.” I just totally fail to find anything enjoyable about this, or to see what this has to do with music as I understand it, or what in God´s name is going on in your head that you want to make such noises on a musical instrument. Quite frankly, I was kind of shocked at what a negative, unpleasant experience it was, listening to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039935</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039401'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I submitted the proposal for `tcgetwinsize` to POSIX a few years ago.  I originally wrote it because I was sick of having to turn off _POSIX_C_SOURCE for just a single file to get glibc to expose TIOCGWINSZ.SIGWINCH and the TIOCGWINSZ ioctl() were originally omitted from POSIX as they were considered relevant for windowing systems only and GUI-stuff was considered out of scope for POSIX.  Furthermore, POSIX only specifies ioctl() for STREAMS; other interfaces that traditionally use ioctl() calls are specified in POSIX using wrapper functions (which is what the new interface is; it is specified such that you can implement it just by wrapping the traditional TIOCGWINSZ/TIOCSWINSZ ioctl calls).My original proposal had functions tcgetsize() and tcsetsize(), but it turns out that QNX already uses these identifiers with an incompatible signature, so a last minute change was made to name these tcgetwinsize() and tcsetwinsize().Furthermore, the winsize structure traditionally also has ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel members indicating the resolution of the terminal.  This existed primarily becaus on some historical virtual terminals, a client could change the video mode by calling the TIOCSWINSZ ioctl, providing resolution and row/column count for the desired video mode.  While no current virtual terminal known to me supports this, the POSIX spec mandates that if a slave PTY calls tcsetwinsize(), the window size update is propagated to the master, allowing terminal emulators to implement this feature if desired.  Another objection raised was that the traditional unsigned short type may be insufficient for future high-definition screens and a resolution may not be well defined for some types of terminals like hardcopy or braille terminals.I maintain that submitting a feature to POSIX and waiting for a new version of the standard to be released is probably the easiest way to get glibc to implement a feature you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anybody wondering "why couldn't they just...", there is a lot of complexity in TTYs and PTYs. The kernel is even involved in line discipline and job control. Those Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+C keys you press? The kernel gets involved.It may seem strange that there's a process signal for window-size changes, but that's what was needed back in 1985. There's a similar dance with the Amiga's console.device, but both Unix and Amiga TTYs are better than Windows' terminals where there was no such thing as a PTY until Windows 10, you had to make direct API calls, and even now it's still pretty slow: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-l...This page is a great overview pf the Unix TTY/PTY subsystem: https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terminals, ttys, etc. have some of the most arcane and outdated APIs I am aware of. It's like a window back into the 1970s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039401</guid></item><item><title>24.

Even just with some basic tests I can see that it produces designs with a much higher degree of polish than regular LLM models, and with much more of a design bent.  I'll definitely use this for some prototyping this week!I wonder what changes you've made from standard LLMS to get here?  I could imagine trying to put things on guard rails, giving it some components to build off, or just fine tuning based on a really nice corpus of good websites (maybe generated with this tool).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a very useful browser extension. Really love the fact that you are even able to convert the styles to TailwindCSS. Very clever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am going to be that person, but how is the copyright for the output of tools like this? Since not all websites include license on their site, yet their looks are replicated, this might be even less clear than with LLMs in general.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043552</guid></item><item><title>25.

Excited to see DataChain on the front page :)Maintainer and author here. Happy to answer any questions.We built DataChain because our DVC couldn't fully handle data transformations and versioning directly in S3/GCS/Azure without data copying.Analogy with "DBT for unstractured data" applies very well to DataChain since it transforms data (using Python, not SQL) inside in storages (S3, not DB). Happy to talk more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool!  Does this assume the unstructured data already has a corresponding metadata file?My most common use cases involve getting PDFs or HTML files and I have to parse the metadata to store along with the embedding.Would I have to run a process to extract file metadata into JSONs for every embedding/chunk? Would keys created based off document be title+chunk_no?Very interested in this because documents from clients are subject to random changes and I don’t have very robust systems in place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took me a minute to grok what this was for, but I think I like itIt doesn't really replace any of the tooling we use to wrangle data at scale (like prefect or dagster or temporal) but as a local library it seems to be excellent, I think what confused me most was the comparison to dbt.I like the from_* utils and the magic of the Column class operator overloading and how chains can be used as datasets. Love how easy checkpointing is too. Will give it a go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043948</guid></item><item><title>26.

Python does that beautifully here, and that's the intent. It's not Python that's confusing, it's your previous experience with other languages that's confusing you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know the point of the piece is the python syntax here, but I got stuck on: "judge things like code quality / speed / conciseness etc."Do people generally write concise code on right off the bat when confronted with a new problem? I've always taken the same approach I would with writing: get something that works; refactor for concision. Maybe everyone else is playing 3D chess and I'm still on Chutes and Ladders?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused about this blog post. Python is mostly C inspired but actually more pseudocode inspired (which helps its popularity) which is why chained expressions exist.Also, why would you conduct an interview in a language where even if you don't know the syntax (and this is obscure) you could have looked it up or disallowed the interview to be done in Python? I think the due diligence with this issue is more to the interviewer than Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42020103</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short post I have some fun with Amazon Q Developer and get it to write code that runs on my virtual Commodore 64. Here is the code it produced. It runs.....well almost. I see a square sprite move smoothly across the screen and when it gets to the end it crashes with the following error:Illegal quantity error in 200I turn to Amazon Q to help me fix this issue, asking it to resolve this error. It quickly provides me with updated code and an explanation of why I got the error. This correction ensures that the high bit of the sprite's X coordinate is set correctly when the sprite moves beyond the 255th pixel, allowing it to move across the entire width of the screen. After looking at some Redit groups, it is clear that the way to use the 6502 assembler tool is the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Online tutorials? That would explain whether it would be possible to adapt this workflow to supporting other relatively obscure platforms, with a limited documentation set that's certainly not available online on the internet in easily parsable HTML: e.g. PDP-11 assembly, Turbo Pascal, classic Macintosh/Macintosh Toolbox, etc.Who knows, it might be a shot in the arm for retrocomputing enthusiasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  // Zero page variables

AI extended zero page, I see… (zp_dx and zp_dy are in 6502 hardcoded stack range, not in zero page at all).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author of the post here.

&lt;p&gt;Vogue is an RIAA-certified triple-platinum hit, selling over six million copies since its 1991 release on the "I'm Breathless" album by pop mega-star Madonna. Vogue topped charts in Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has been sampled by Kylie Minogue, Beyoncé, and Ariana Grande. The track starts with a startling, sweeping vocal line, "What are you looking at?" that pans around our heads like Michael Bay's camera.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a DSP class in my EE degree where we implemented a very minor transform that would shift position of audio and it was wild.It's impossible to get 3D audio to be absolutely as flawless as the real world because human ears all vary slightly and your 3D spacial perception of sound is literally tuned on your own ears, but QSound's transfer functions come as close as you can get.The algorithm also falls apart a bit outside of the sweet spot, and is really only useful in headphones and specific cases where a human is known to be placed in a certain location relative to speakers.The original model was developed using a simulated human head and lots of hand-tuning. I am curious if we've advanced far enough with tech that a more modern set of transfer function parameters could be developed.Nothing beats N speakers for positional audio, but this is a pretty decent replacement if the conditions are ideal.OpenAL was designed as an open-source library to bring 3D audio to the masses in the same way that OpenGL did (basically exposing QSound/equivalent hardware on sound cards to an API), but I'm not sure what happened to it [1].[1] https://www.openal.org/documentation/openal-1.1-specificatio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you like this kind of stereophonic sound, I recommend Art of Noise.

Implementation quality of HBSD features is often poor or very poor.  https://www.fabiankeil.de/gehacktes/hardenedbsd/ is just one example.  Specifically some of the changes made to "harden" the system are pretty dubious and introduce new bugs, possibly security relevant, that did not previously exist.  No one runs or pen tests HBSD.  It's even more niche than OpenBSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Executable file integrity enforcementI assume but don't know for sure that this refers to Veriexec in NetBSD, and I'm not sure what in HardenedBSD. Anyone know?https://man.netbsd.org/veriexec.8My understanding is that Veriexec isn't enabled by default - the manpage says only that "[s]ome kernels already enable Veriexec by default." If you have this enabled, how do you upgrade binaries? The manpage says that in strict mode 1, write access to monitored binaries is allowed but then access is denied. So I assume that after file modification, root then runs veriexecgen and veriexecctl load as mentioned in the manual to update the signatures list. So it seems that strict level 1 isn't functionally different from a read-only /usr or even just root-owned binaries. In either case, you just need root to update targeted binaries. Surely I'm missing something and would appreciate some insight.At a glance as an outsider, stricter modes appear somewhat functionally similar to "chflags schg" on BSD systems, where more work is needed to get around restrictions. In the case of schg, you have to reboot into single user mode, remove the schg flag, then modify the binary, and continue booting into multi-user mode. You could do this as a remote attacker (as in not having console access) depending on what boot files are or aren't protected with schg, but modifying all the necessary files can be a source of new problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:26:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036652</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website discusses a security vulnerability in EA's user authentication system that allows hackers to take over user accounts. The vulnerability was reported to EA in January 2021 but had not been fully patched by April 2021. The post also outlines steps that users can take to protect their accounts, such as enabling two-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords. Additionally, the author highlights the need for companies like EA to prioritize security and address vulnerabilities promptly to protect user data.&lt;/p&gt;

When poking around at Madden I found they have a common backend called blaze that has generic web and tcp endpoints. We built out a tool to call these endpoints (having to upload xml) and only later found out that every time we made the call it was crashing their servers but since we were grabbing a new server each request we were crashing all of their madden servers one by one. They ended up building an API to discourage people poking around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    So, like any sane person would, I overnighted an Xbox, installed Battlefield 2042, and waited for the moment of truth...
     
    I was in!

I love hackers &lt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so spoofing, or using a real console, bypasses 2FA!
I think the most interesting observation was this... "never seen a 2FA prompt on a console".
There must be other opportunities for such... investigating :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42052143</guid></item><item><title>2.

Nobody's doing 4nm fabrication in their garage, I reasoned, but surely we could get to ~10um.As I read more about the dark art of IC fabrication, though, I realized that even this was a faint dream. I had imagined a world of lasers carving troughs, and print heads carefully placing down the lines and doping the silicon, an elegant symphony of modern technology.But the real world is much messier -- every stage involves dangerous and toxic chemicals, processes that are spoiled by a spec of dust in the wrong place, either causing a cascade of reagent failures or a physical impediment to correctness; distressingly analog and oh so messy and built by trial and error and refined by domain experts in ways that are intensely hard to replicate because all the same lessons need to be learned again each time.I'm glad to see the work being done here for hobbyist fabrication, but barring huge leaps and bounds, the gap between the neat lines in Magic and the shiny silicon discs is a vast chasm owned by the material scientists, not the electrical engineers or the software engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody seems to have mentioned electron beam lithography. Hobbyists have done that.[1]E-beam lithography has been used since the 1970s. It's slow; it might take a day to make a CPU. That's why it's not used as a production process. But as a prototype process, it works fine. There are a few hobbyists doing this.[1]E-beam systems are basically scanning electron microscopes with more power. There's a vacuum chamber, means for focusing and steering an electron beam similar to what's inside a CRT, and control equipment. It's all computer-controlled, of course.This has many advantages. Software can correct for nonlinearities in the scanning. The machine can inspect what it's written by scanning at low power.You still have to coat and etch; it's not a dry process. The beam just exposes photoresist.The equipment is the size of a desk. Here's a machine at CMU.[2] Many universities have such machines.[1] https://hackaday.com/2024/08/06/creating-1%c2%b5m-features-t...[2] https://nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/facilities-equipment/fei-sirion....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I'm sympathetic to democratizing access to simple fabrication technology, I have serious misgivings about hobbyists getting involved.There's the obvious stuff: you can't avoid HF, and it's nasty stuff. You can die. But that's not what I'm the most worried about; people can make smart decisions to reduce risk, and ultimately people can make their own decisions about their risk tolerance.What I'm worried about is the SF6 for the RIE. Kg for kg, that stuff has a global warming potential of more than 24,000 TIMES the warming potential of CO2. If it's all broken down in the plasma chamber, or there's exhaust scrubbers involved like you'd have at an industrial fab, then it's no issue.But hobbyists are going to be spilling and purging a bunch of unmodified SF6. It's kind of an ecological catastrophe. Some things are better not done at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051968</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine titled "Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats." The report aims to provide scientifically-based recommendations for essential nutrients for dogs and cats to maintain good health and prevent nutrient deficiencies. It outlines the key nutrients needed by companion animals, including proteins, amino acids, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, and discusses factors influencing nutrient requirements such as growth, lactation, and environmental conditions. The report highlights the importance of balanced nutrition for the overall well-being and health of dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

Nobody can wait 20 years to find out if a certain material is good enough or not.However, the real failure seems to be the lack of urgency when they signs started to show up:Upon reflection, the unusually large and progressive cable pullouts of key structural cables that could be seen during visual inspection several months and years before the M4N failure should have raised the highest alarm level, requiring urgent action. The lack of documented concern from the contracted engineers about the inconsequentiality of the cable pullouts or the safety factors between Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the failure is alarming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if I am not a radio astronomer, this instrument was unique in nature and still in use for very specific observations and until the very end of its operation was able to deliver data. It is disheartening to learn that it was indeed due to gross maintenance negligence (as assumed originally by many) that the final fatal failure occurred, when potentially the structure could have been salvaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practical Engineering on YouTube has an episode covering the collapse of this structure[1]. It's very good and worth a watch.[1] https://youtu.be/3oBCtTv6yOw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:21:55 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051368</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website discusses AMD's achievement of outselling Intel in the data center space for the first time. This marks a significant milestone in the rivalry between the two semiconductor giants. AMD's success is attributed to their EPYC processors, which have gained popularity for their performance and efficiency. The article also highlights the impact this shift may have on the market and the competitive landscape within the data center industry.&lt;/p&gt;

We now had a justification to switch from arcnet to token ring.  Our servers could push things way faster!Then, in the middle 1991, the AMD 80386-40 CPU came out.  Mind completely blown!  We ordered some (I think) Twinhead motherboards. They were so fast we could only use Hercules mono cards in them; all other video cards were fried.  16Mb token ring was out, so some of my clients moved to it with the fantastic CPU.I have seen some closet-servers running Novell NetWare 3.14 (?) with that AMD CPU in the late '90s.  There was a QUIC tape &amp; tape drive in the machine that was never changed for maybe a decade?  The machine never went down (or properly backed up).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damn, first Intel missed out on Mobile, then it fumbled AI, and now it's being seriously challenged on its home turf. Pat has his work cut out for him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising it took so long given how dominant the EPYC CPUs were for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054449</guid></item><item><title>6.

What if some, but not all, servers crash and reboot? How do you ensure the correct order in that case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that might be useful is to allow a given server in the chain to fail. For example, if you had a Proxmox (or other hypervisor) cluster, in the event that a single node fails to come up, you'd probably want everything else to still boot. Or maybe it would be easier if there was a separate category for VM vs. hypervisor?Either way, neat project, and thank you for sharing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42050862</guid></item><item><title>7.

Could I just run a string across the Atlantic Ocean?If we do lay cables on top of other cables how high do they get stacked? Are there challenges to bring the lower cables back up? Does that happen? Or do we just keep them down there forever basically and upgrade the hardware at the terminal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42041581</guid></item><item><title>8.

This process has been incredibly valuable to me, and even in the LLM era of 2024, I still enjoy blogging. Often, the primary user of my blog is myself; I go back to my past entries to help guide further research and exploration.I once heard a senior developer say, 'I’m not shy to admit that after I finish a blog post, I’m at ease to forget about it—because I know I can always look it up again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author suggests everyone should watch the Larry McEnerney lecture but he seems to have missed a pretty important point from that lecture.A really big point Larry tries to make during his lecture is that there are 2 types of writing. One you do for yourself (to help clear your ideas) and the other and the other one is designed to valuable to the reader.And he is pretty obsessed with the idea of writing valuable text. He even says that if your text isn't valuable there is no point in making it persuasive, organized or clear.For me this was a pretty interesting revelation. For most of my life I had this idea that the quality of the content and the quality of the writing were tightly related. And this idea made me believe that if you have good content, good writing should follow naturally.After watching this lecture I realized that content and writing are separated axis, and you can definitely have one without the other. LLMs are pretty good at writing without content, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My biggest challenge with writing blogs/newsletters is the fear of publishing, not getting it "perfect", or being horribly wrong about whatever I'm writing about.To get over this I just made simple personal blog/site using GH pages/jekyll/markup that doesn't have 1. A marketing version of a "publish" function and 2. the posts are perpetually in DRAFT.Basically there is no 'done' which leaves me more comfortable in putting my thoughts on the internet instead of leaving them in my head. I can keep going back to the ideas and refining them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:22:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045477</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website is a GitHub repository for the "Whirlwind" tool developed by the Fortress project, offering a high-performance, lightweight Lua coroutine lifecycle manager for LuaJIT based applications. The tool optimizes coroutine scheduling, provides transparent hooking for coroutine yielding, supports low-level manipulation of coroutine contexts, and allows for scripted control over Lua coroutines. It emphasizes efficient usage of coroutine memory and aims to speed up LuaJIT applications by reducing unnecessary memory allocations and context switching.&lt;/p&gt;

The benchmarks look good, but by immediately waking the waker[0], you've effectively created a spin-lock. They may work in some very specific circumstances, but they will most likely in practice be more costly to your scheduler (which likely uses locks btw) than just using locks[0]: https://github.com/fortress-build/whirlwind/blob/0e4ae5a2aba...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing which wasn’t obvious to me from the benchmark: What’s the key distribution? A sharded map will probably have great performance on uniform keys, but in my experience it’s far more common to have power law distribution in real life scenarios.It would be good to see a benchmark where it only touches a _single_ key. If Whirlwind is still fast than the others I would be far more convinced to use it unconditionally.EDIT: I also see that you're benchmarking on a M3 Max. Note that this has 6 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. This means that if you're running at &lt;6 cores it will most likely start out running it at the efficiency core. From my experience it's quite important to do warmup phases in order to get stable results at low thread count. And even then I find it hard to reason about the results since you're running in mixed set of cores…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Benches look promising! My main concern is validating correctness; implementing good concurrency primitives is always challenging. Have you looked into testing against a purpose-built concurrency model checker like tokio-rs/loom [1] or awslabs/shuttle [2]? IMO that would go a long way towards building trust in this impl.[1] https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website discusses how to create a horizontal scrolling layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox in order to optimize the design for larger screens. By combining the two layout techniques, the author demonstrates how to create a responsive and visually appealing horizontal layout that adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes. The article provides detailed instructions on implementing the code and includes examples to help web developers create dynamic and modern layouts for their websites.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only for epubs, for everybody who actually wants to print to real paper, too, ideally with a working cross browser solution.Mistake is largely not in the specs, but in the lack of support for them. Page breaking controls, weirdly breaking tables, lack of access to area outside the page box to influence headers/footers without weird hacks etc. etc. For printing, the 1990ies never ended.This leads to the bizarre situation where basically everyone who has semi complex printing needs in web applications will create PDF and then print that - and for creating those PDFs, often HTML to PDF conversion is used, just with actually implemented CSS for paged media. Which again proves that the spec is at least 99% there, if somebody would just kindly implement it in a browser, too.Won't be more complex than having the latest WebGL whatever thing in your browser engine ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another frustrating thing with ebooks is that you can't get them in PDF format any more. So much time is spent making a nicely fomatted hardcopy edition, then the ebook is only available as a terribly auto-converted epub that throws away all the layout and style. Particularly cookbooks, as well as anything technical, I just can't stand how lazy, ugly, and difficult to read the epubs are. All the tooling already exists to produce PDFs identical to the print version, but no, we can't have those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to mention the ugly/unusable rendering of mathematical formulate in ebooks on my Kindle, which is gatherig dust.Layouting is an art and a craft, and the fact that it's automated by people who
lack the specialized knowledge, or for whom it is not a priority (quarter century old bug reports, really?) suggests that in 2025, you should still avoid ebooks if you care about quality and aesthetics.This is a shame because e-ink is just becoming usable. Anyhow, long live the paper book!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42047677</guid></item><item><title>13.

When we are anxious and awake the amygdala is active and norepinephrine (the “fight or flight” neurotransmitter) is high.During REM sleep, surprisingly the amygdala is inactive and norepinephrine is 85% lower than base waking levels (not high anxious levels). So the brain is in a super relaxed state!I wrote a paper on the implications for dream content and interpretation (I’m a psychotherapist in training).If you’re interested you can find the paper here:https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/k6trzAnd it was discussed on HN here:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19143590&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there are two types of fear mostly, the innate survival animalistic fear and the self-perpetuating fear caused due to misunderstanding. The animalistic fear is present in all and it's not possible to get rid of. When you see a snake or a tiger in front of you, that fear is natural. The response is to jump or run and is so spontaneous, you can't really control it. It's necessary for survival. But I think we are interested in the other fear, the one that is bound to attachment. You see a tiger, you panic, turns out to be a cat, you laugh it off, go away, that fear is not an issue. But if you go about your day thinking, what if that was a tiger? What if I get jumped by tiger this time? Then, you are creating the fear. The fear has no basis, except for it was implanted to you awhile ago. And now you are attaching yourself to it. You are extending it which is the actual problem. Most of us have fears that go back to childhood. If you think back far enough(like the tiger example), question yourself why you are afraid, you know the answers.One more example, I used to be afraid of getting heart-attacks in the past. Even gas passing would make me panic. Have I ever had a heart-attack before? No. How am I so damn sure that I have a heart-attack if I don't even know what it's supposed to feel like? Heart-attack is a bad thing and it shouldn't be happening to me. How is every acid reflux a heart-attack to me now. I have created my own bubble of fear. When though? I sure as hell didn't know what heartattack is when I was born. So it happened when I was able to comprehend what a heart-attack is right? For me, it's due to people around me passing, it's due to reading on Internet about young celebrities dying to strokes, watching movies, etc. It got implanted in me. I don't know a heartattack I just have an idea of it which is not the same thing. Not even remotely related.Fear arises due to misunderstanding. If you trace it far back enough, fear was implanted mostly in the childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://gwern.net/backstop#hui-nengs-flag -- Evolution as Backstop for Reinforcement Learning -- Hui Neng’s Flag -- the mathematics of positive and negative reinforcementhttps://gwern.net/fiction/batman -- The Gift of the Amygdali -- Sci-Fi, anxiety, pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42042417</guid></item><item><title>15.

It was suggested that the radioactive part of an Orion-style space craft be put far away from the crew compartment.We can probably can thank Fred Ordway (Marshall Spaceflight Center engineer) who Kubrick brought on board as technical consultant back then. (And of course for the look of the ships that are still so iconic over 50 years later I shouldn't leave off Harry Lange.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pictures of Orion concepts have been widely distributed for decades, but not this one. Going into space with an air-breathing nuclear bomb powered jet engine. That is truly weird. How fast was it supposed to be going in atmosphere, I wonder. Did it carry reaction mass for vacuum so it could keep going out of the atmosphere?The trouble with nuclear rockets is that although you have plenty of energy, you still need to carry reaction mass - air, or water, or something - and a lot of it. That becomes the limit on delta-V.(The great frustration of rockets: not only do rockets need something to push against, they have to carry it with them.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some visuals https://interestingengineering.com/science/project-orion-the...PDF in this article is a 404&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:23:55 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42047243</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog on codspeed.io discusses the state of Python 3.13 performance with a focus on free threading. It analyzes the impact of Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on Python's performance and scalability issues related to multi-threading. The article explores the improvements in performance and concurrency in Python 3.13, especially in scenarios where parallel processing is crucial. It emphasizes the importance of understanding Python's threading limitations and the potential enhancements in future versions to address these issues for better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

E.g. disabling the GIL will break tonnes of code, lots of compilation projects involve changes to the ABI, etc.I guess getting loops in Python to run 5-10x faster will still save some people time, but it's also never going to be a replacement for the zoo of specialized python-like compilers because it'll never get to actual high performance territory, and it's not clear that it's worth all the ecosystem churn it might cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm glad the Python community is focusing more on CPython's performance. Getting speed ups on existing code for free feels great. As much as I hate how slow Python is, I do think its popularity indicates it made the correct tradeoffs in regards to developer ease vs being fast enough.Learning it has only continued to be a huge benefit to my career, as it's used everywhere which underlies how important popularity of a language can be for developers when evaluating languages for career choices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance for python3.14t alpha 1 is more like 3.11 in what I've tested. Not good enough if Python doesn't meet your needs, but this comes after 3.12 and 3.13 have both performed worse for me.3.13t doesn't seem to have been meant for any serious use. Bugs in gc and so on are reported, and not all fixes will be backported apparently. And 3.14t still has unavoidable crashes. Just too early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051197</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The website explores a new approach to manipulating queries using Lisp programming language. The author discusses the limitations of current query languages and presents a novel notation that allows for more flexible and efficient query manipulation. By introducing this Lisp-based query notation, the author aims to improve the way queries are structured and processed, potentially opening up new possibilities for data manipulation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s how I understand the article.Then they also store everything which the partners upload to check if it’s created by them.If other AI players also would store everything they create and make it available in a similar way there could be indeed some working watermark.If one would use a private run AI to change the public run AI generated content to alter it there still would be a percentage similarity recognisable to hint that it might come from one of the public AIs.Timestamps would become quite relevant since much content would start to repeat itself at some point and the answers generated might be similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These watermarks are not robust to paraphrasing attacks: AUC ROC falls from 0.95 to 0.55 (barely better than guessing) for a 100 token passage.The existing impossibility results imply that these attacks are essentially unavoidable (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378) and not very costly, so this line of inquiry into LLM watermarking seems like a dead end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article goes into it a little bit, but an interview with Scott Aaronson goes into some detail about how watermarking works[0].He's a theoretical computer scientist but he was recruited by OpenAI to work on AI safety. He has a very practical view on the matter and is focusing his efforts on leveraging the probabilistic nature of LLMs to provide a digital undetectable watermark. So it nudges certain words to be paired together slightly more than random and you can mathematically derive with some level of certainty whether an output or even a section of an output was generated by the LLM. It's really clever and apparently he has a working prototype in development.Some work arounds he hasn't figured out yet is asking for an output in language X and then translating it into language Y. But those may still be eventually figured out.I think watermarking would be a big step forward to practical AI safety and ideally this method would be adopted by all major LLMs.That part starts around 1 hour 25 min in.&gt; Scott Aaronson: Exactly. In fact, we have a pseudorandom function that maps the N-gram to, let’s say, a real number from zero to one. Let’s say we call that real number ri for each possible choice i of the next token. And then let’s say that GPT has told us that the ith token should be chosen with probability pi.https://axrp.net/episode/2023/04/11/episode-20-reform-ai-ali...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051098</guid></item><item><title>19.

While the US may decide to actively support Taiwan, at the very least a war over that will disrupt production.Should Taiwan fall, and China choose to ban exports from there to the US, then the fun and games would really start.As long as back-channels exist to supply the chips to China, then there's less incentive for China to control Taiwan. The ban exists as good politics (we don't ship to our adversaries) while the back-channels ensure they aren't forced into a position no-one wants them to be in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42048033&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will see what happens - but given nvidias growth and how heavy they are now weighted I’m skeptical there will be any enforcement until well after the elections.Neither party wants to look “bad for the economy”, even if the people harmed isn’t of significant size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:24:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42048065</guid></item><item><title>21.

It is still a contested area of research and you have some cool stuff like CLIPDraw[2] where they use gradient decent to approximate a vector to the embeddings of CLIP.[1] https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/optimizing_images.html

The lake is full of landlocked kokanee salmon that never see an ocean in their lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL Pando is not just an especially large quaking aspen, but rather a triploid mutant that can reproduce only asexually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that Pando is a single organism is so confusing to me. I’m guessing there are more forests like Pando that are also a single organism? Is this something unique to this particular species?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42046953</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the history of Usenet, a distributed discussion system that predated the World Wide Web. It explores the origins, growth, and eventual commercialization of Usenet, analyzing the impact of various factors such as technology, users, and organizations on its evolution. The document also sheds light on the social dynamics within Usenet communities and how they influenced the system's development. Additionally, it delves into the challenges faced by Usenet, such as spam and the issue of commercialization, eventually leading to its decline in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

It had a section I particularly remember about focusing discussions on the topic of a newsgroup rather than on the newsgroup. Anyone recognize this?(Today is Tuesday the 11389th of September 1993.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the section "conclusion" is a good summary of the article, of major usenet design decisions and also of it's shortcomings.It seems it has ~~degenerated~~ evolved to a niche file sharing platform for obscure contents?I remember the days when comp.os.linux.announce was a good place to keep a pulse on what's cooking in terms of fun FOSS software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Personally owned computers—microcomputers, in the terminology of the day—were rare and were the domain of a few
hobbyists. Most were very small and generally lacked hard drives;
bulk storage was via audio cassette tape or (for the lucky few) on
floppy disks with a capacity of about 1.5 megabytes."1.5 megabytes?  Um, no.  3.5" floppies weren't out yet in 1979, and they were 1.44MB.  5.25" double-sided high-density floppies were 1.2MB, and I'm not sure they were were out yet either.  I was using 8" floppies in 1979, and IIRC they were about 250KB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42048021</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the launch of the world's first wooden satellite, WISA Woodsat, as part of a mission to test its durability and performance in space conditions in preparation for future Mars exploration. The satellite, made from birch plywood, aims to study how wood behaves in space and potentially offer a sustainable alternative to traditional satellite materials. It is a collaboration between Finnish company Arctic Astronautics and researchers from the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

But closer images show that these are apparently some sort of rivet?I found a (Japanese-language-only) news piece that shows some of the crafting and assembly of the satellite, and the box body certainly holds together by itself, via some beautifully intricate joinery:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_F-NzzC7RA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by this statement in the article:&lt;&lt; LignoSat is made of honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native to Japan, and has been made using a traditional Japanese technique without screws or glue. &gt;&gt;From photos I've seen while searching for more information, it does appear that there's a wooden core structure that is joined without fasteners. But it's then given a metal exoskeleton and what certainly appears to be metal fasteners.I'd like to understand whether the goal is to create satellites without metal, as the article seemed to imply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outer Wilds was accurate!Wooden spaceships, helmets, and other contraptions, augmented with metals and… other “spoiler” materials.To anyone interested in space with a day or two to spare, I highly recommend playing Outer Wilds. It’s very good and unlike any other game (and I can’t explain why without spoiling the magic).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051687</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website delves into the history and significance of the IBM mainframe computer throughout the decades, highlighting its enduring value and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape. It discusses how mainframes have continuously evolved to meet changing demands, providing reliability, security, and performance for businesses. The article emphasizes the mainframe's relevance in modern computing environments and its promising future with advancements in cloud technologies and artificial intelligence. Overall, it praises the IBM mainframe as a foundational component of computing history and a resilient platform that continues to excel in contemporary IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055556'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least in my experience, when I've heard that the "mainframe is going to die", it's specifically referencing the IBM ecosystem - COBOL and friends.To me it looks like the author is grasping for straws when saying "well, a server rack is just like a mainframe, so the mainframe is not dying!".To me it's the opposite: yes, a server rack is just like a mainframe. That's why the mainframe is dying - a bunch of servers can do the same work much more cheaply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article reflecting on who controls computational resources - the user or the company.I want to respond to one point mentioned:&gt; Those who continue to do significant work offline will become the exception; meaning they will be an electoral minority. With so much effort being put into web apps, they may even be seen as eccentrics; meaning there may not be much sympathy for their needs in the halls of power.What I find scary is that developers see web apps (and hence the open web platform) as no longer fashionable, and instead focus on developing mobile apps (iOS and Android).There are various services that are only available to mobile users, not PC / web browser users. One I can recall off the top of my head is Snapchat a decade ago. Other examples today include various bike sharing apps, and possibly some banking apps too. Often, the web app and mobile app don't reach feature parity. Often, the company pushes people to download the mobile app and discourages visiting the website (e.g. Reddit).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think "looks like" is very ephemeral to what being a mainframe IS. it's true that MP systems can look like a single entity, but they are highly asynchronous. The prism architecture meant a single clock state propagating cleanly across the CPU(s) provided a consistent, time managed framework to be all things to all people. (thats how I understand it)A Sun E10000 is to my mind, as close as a mainframe gets in the post-sparc era. The Tandem non-stops had some of it, the final Dec cluster model was getting there but in a distributed async clocked manner.In the end the point of the mainframe was the TPC. The sustained rate it could process edge device request-response sequences inside the bounds of your choices in the CAP theorem. Distributed systems solve the same problem, but with other consequences. It still freaks me out that IBM had so many irons in the fire they had room to do this, AND to make unix work inside this, and manage legacy, and scale out to whole-of-government or SAGE or SABRE or you-name-it.I hated using AIX as a sysadmin from Dec world view btw. I'm not an IBM fanboi. I lived in the competition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:35 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055556</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website explores the trend of "cloud repatriation," where companies are bringing workloads and data back from the cloud to on-premises infrastructure due to various reasons such as cost considerations, performance issues, and security concerns. The article discusses the factors driving this shift, the challenges of migrating workloads back on-premises, and highlights the importance of a hybrid cloud approach for organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054813'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know that 37Signals counts as a "major enterprise". Their Cloud exodus can't have been more than a few dozen servers, right?Meanwhile AWS is growing at 20%/year, Azure at 33% and GCP at 35%. That doesn't seem compatible with any kind of major cloud repatriation trend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GEICO is moving away from the cloud because their IT is a joke. They had a horrible on-prem infrastructure, so they moved to the cloud not knowing how, and they made the same mistakes in the cloud as on-prem, plus the usual mistakes every cloud migration runs into. They are moving away from the cloud because their new VP's entire career is focused on running her own hardware. What we know about their new setup is absolutely bonkers (like, K8s-on-OpenStack-on-K8s bonkers). Look to them for what not to do.37signals is like the poster child for NIH syndrome. They keep touting cost savings as the reason for the move, but from what I have gathered, they basically did nothing to save cost in the cloud. It is trivial to save 75% off AWS's list price. They will even walk you through it, they literally want you to save money. That, plus using specific tech in specific ways, allows you to reap major benefits of modern designs while reducing cost more. 37signals didn't seem to want to go that route. But they do love to build their own things, so servers would be a natural thing for them to DIY.Almost every argument against the cloud - cost inefficiency, fear of vendor lock-in, etc - has easy solutions that make the whole thing extremely cost competitive, if not a way better value, than trying to become your own cloud hosting provider. It's very hard to estimate the real world costs, both known and unknown, of DIY hosting (specifically the expertise, or lack of it, and the impacts from doing it wrong, which is very likely to happen if cloud hosting isn't your core business). But it's a 100% guarantee that you will never do it better than AWS.AI is the only place I could reasonably imagine somebody having an on-prem advantage. At the moment, we still live in a world where that hardware isn't a commodity in the way every other server is. So you might just be faster to deploy, or cheaper to buy, with AI gear. Storage is similar but not nearly as tight a market. But that will change eventually once either the hype bubble bursts, or there's more gear for cheaper for the cloud providers to sell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a short simple post that comes down to this:&gt; Weekly explains that “just running legacy applications in the cloud is prohibitively expensive,” highlighting how lift-and-shift approaches often fail to deliver expected benefits.Yes, if you have a mature business without active development at a scale where compute/storage costs is a substantial accounting line item, then it makes sense to run on hardware that doesn't have the flexibility and cost of the cloud.There is an in-between that makes much more sense for most though. Running on provisioned bare metal. Lots of providers offer this as a better performance/price option where you don't have to deal with provisioning hardware but do everything else from the OS+maintenance and up.At one company we used large bare-metal machine instances provisioned for stable parts of the application architecture (e.g. database and webapp instances) and the cloud for new development where it made sense to leverage capabilities, e.g. DynamoDB with cross-region replication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:25:45 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054813</guid></item><item><title>27.

To add one more: Karl Schroeder’s Virga series is placed within the Vega system (not a spoiler, so far as I know.) I’m still reading through the series, but I came across them through a recommendation from Cory Doctorow — which is high praise.

Even if we accept model weights as source code, which is highly dubious, this clearly violates clauses 5 and 6 of the Open Source Definition. It discriminates between users (clause 5) by refusing to grant any rights to users in the European Union, and it discriminates between uses (clause 6) by requiring agreement to an Acceptable Use Policy.EDIT: The HN title was changed, which previously made the claim. But as HN user swyx pointed out, Tencent is also claiming this is open source, e.g.: "The currently unveiled Hunyuan-Large (Hunyuan-MoE-A52B) model is the largest open-source Transformer-based MoE model in the industry".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The model meets/beats Llama despite having an order-of-magnitude fewer active parameters (52B vs 405B). Absolutely bonkers. AI is moving so fast with these breakthroughs -- synthetic data, distillation, alt. architectures (e.g. MoE/SSM), LoRA, RAG, curriculum learning, etc.We've come so astonishingly far in like two years. I have no idea what AI will do in another year, and it's thrilling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Territory” shall mean the worldwide territory, excluding the territory of the European Union.Anyone have some background on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:26:05 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054186</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The website reports on the recent layoffs at the Mozilla Foundation, highlighting the impact on advocacy and global programs. The company, known for its web browser Firefox, faced financial challenges leading to the reduction of staff working on projects that focus on internet health and open-source initiatives. The layoffs are seen as a setback to Mozilla's mission to promote an open and accessible internet for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect the corporation employs more people than the foundation? So stuff like development is not included in that count.I do wonder if the cuts are because of anticipation of lower search revenue from Google with tech restricting legislation on the horizon and google's focus pivoting to AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A job for advocacy division is to, uhm, advocate for the product and mission.We all know how that has worked out in the last decade or so (down to &lt;3% market share from 14% in 2014 and 31% in 2009, though I wonder about absolute numbers as number of Internet users has gone up).It's fine for Mozilla to recognize this as a failed approach (or team), without dropping their mission altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dupe: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054867&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:26:15 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055979</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post explores the concept of questioning conventional wisdom and the possibility that established beliefs might be inaccurate. The author reflects on how societal norms and cultural assumptions shape our beliefs and argues for the importance of critical thinking and independent judgment. The post encourages readers to challenge prevailing opinions and be open to alternative perspectives, ultimately emphasizing the value of skepticism and intellectual curiosity in navigating the complexities of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051231'&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone not in the field of mathematics, I actually didn't realize there was such an emphasis on attempting to prove famous conjectures correct. I thought the famous conjectures were famous precisely because knowing the veracity of the conjecture (or independence with respect to some formal system) would be a monumental event in any case.I also assumed many mathematicians utilized the strategy of attempting to disprove something as a way to reveal the proof. Sort of like how the best chess players tend to spend most of their thinking time mentally challenging their planned move as opposed to novice chess players who tend to look for reasons confirming why their move will be a good one. Is this not the case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any theorem was a conjecture before its formal proof was accepted by the community. Thus the importance of conjectures is a proxy to the importance of theorems: they are proto-theorems.The fact that the human mind is capable of searching for new mathematical theorems specifically here instead of there, is quite interesting. It's as if a skilled mathematician has knowledge that is bigger than math itself.Penrose used this as argument for the special nature of consciousness, wrongly - it probably makes more sense to remember how the way the human mind is not exact and produces errors all the time plays a huge role in a creative process. And luckily we can amend the human mind by social processes that help eliminating errors again.This way, a conjecture can be thought of as a claim to truth in a competitive environment and that would explain why proving the truth is regarded so much higher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this sentiment is coming from the same place as that of people who oppose more "pure" scientific pursuits in general. You can ask "what good does it do me that some guy was able to go to the moon?" or "who cares about theorizing about black holes, they're really far away", but ultimately pursuing these goals is what got us such crucial everyday stuff like GPS. Sure, you may not care about the goal (even though I think they're worthy goals), but you sure as heck benefit from the journey that got us there. Similarly, chasing mathematical conjectures, even the ones that turn out false, sets us off on journeys on which we discover/invent ever more sophisticated and powerful mathematical tools. And these tools have an amazing tendency to give us insight into broader problems, and help us prove other theorems, even if the conjecture we were originally chasing turns out to be false. It is in this way that chasing conjectures gets us closer to the truth, regardless of their own truthiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]]]</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:26:25 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42051231</guid></item></channel></rss>
