Is salt really that bad? How long would they live if they followed WHO's recommendations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But does it work?This is the third report I’ve seen in recent days and none of them mention if the spoon delivers on its promise. Reporters may be reluctant to share a spoon with dozens of other attendees, but might they practice some journalism by surveying folks who did try it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This idea has been around for a long time:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Wikipedia search patterns can reflect different styles of curiosity among users. It highlights a study that analyzed search data to categorize individuals' interests as either broad or niche. The findings suggest that users with broad curiosity tend to explore a wide range of topics, while those with a niche focus delve deeply into specific subjects. This divergence in search behavior offers insights into how people seek knowledge and engage with information, revealing varying motivations and approaches to learning.&lt;/p&gt;

In countries with lower scores on these variables, people browsed like hunters. Bassett hypothesizes that “in countries that have more structures of oppression or patriarchal forces, there may be a constraining of knowledge production that pushes people more toward this hyperfocus.”This is an odd hypothesis and you know, I’ve read a little bit of enough about postmodernism/critical theory and its influence on hypertext to feel like this take is down right saditty.The need to try to sow conflict between “patriarchy” and “xetriarchy” by depicting one style of curiosity as more virtuous than the other dampens what looks like an otherwise interesting study.And it doesn’t help that the authors don’t appear to list or accessibly depict which countries were more inclined toward one style as opposed to the other.https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn3268If anyone can decipher the sophistry in the actual study, please let me know what’s going on here, especially in figure 8.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related: Isaiah Berlin's "The Hedgehog and the Fox".

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to choose Common Lisp as their programming language of choice. The author outlines several compelling reasons, including the flexibility and power of Lisp's macro system, its ability to support multiple programming paradigms, and its suitability for complex problem-solving tasks and artificial intelligence. They also highlight the importance of Lisp's interactive development environment, which enhances productivity. Overall, the author advocates for Common Lisp as a valuable tool for developers seeking an expressive and efficient way to write programs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SBCL is a great choice! It's a surprisingly dynamic system (so are other CL implementations).A while ago, I did some private work for someone, using SBCL, and sent her the native binary I built, then forgot about the whole thing.The client came back with some new requirements much later, when the project was concluded, and the source code was already lost by that time.I vaguely remembered how I did things, so I spawned a REPL from the old binary, went into the relevant CL package, wrote a new function that overrides the old behavior, and the client's problem was solved.I did all those without the original source code. It was a small thing to fix, but I can't imagine making the same fix so swiftly with any other tech stack, when the source code is lost. I was deeply impressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is a very interesting journey — mine was exactly opposite, after many years with Common Lisp, I moved to Clojure and wouldn't even think of going back. I find it intriguing that the author would want to move in the other direction, especially as concurrency was mentioned (one of the main reasons why I initially looked at Clojure).I wonder what it was about babashka that didn't work for the author. When I need a quick script with batteries included, I use babashka and it works great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like vim-slime is essential to how you work with CL + vim. I've only used vim for not even 2 years, and came across vim-slime 6 months ago when working in ruby and wanting to quickly 'send' code from editor (neovim) to rails console. 2 months ago I launched a startup and for hours every day had to swat/fix repercussions of bugs that weren't apparent pre-launch (as well as doing via the console things users needed but weren't able to do because the feature to do it hadn't been built yet). It was daunting. I don't know how I'd have managed without vim + vim-slime. Probably a lot of copy/pasting from vscode. Vim + vim-slime was at least a 2x productivity improvement, and &gt;2x increase in developer happiness.Another huge benefit of vim and vim-slime is it is immediately valuable when you use/learn any new language. So long as the language has a REPL/console/interpreter that can be opened from the terminal or terminal emulator in any form (e.g. CL, ruby, python, bash etc etc etc) then vim + vim-slime will be a brilliant ~IDE. (Possibly the only thing I haven't been able to do but wanted to is 'send' code from neovim to the javascript console in chrome, which would be pretty awesome!)A side note: I found doom-emacs very similar to vim, only needed ~10 or so new keyboard shortcuts to be productive in emacs. (I still much prefer vim, but I'm not so down on emacs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671105</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a new exoplanet named "LTT 9779 b," which orbits a star located about 260 light-years from Earth. This exoplanet is notable for its unusual characteristics, including a very short orbital period of just 19 hours and a highly inflated size, suggesting it may have a gaseous atmosphere. The research, conducted using the European Southern Observatory's instruments, provides insights into the nature of such extreme exoplanets and contributes to the understanding of planet formation and evolution in different stellar environments. The findings are expected to prompt further studies and observations of similar exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm noticing that the reporting on this, including the ESO press release, is vague on exactly what this "industrial megaproject" happens to be.  Ordinarily, there is no hesitation to disclose this, unless it's a military matter.  Or a sacred cow.A sacred cow, indeed.  It's a green energy operation powered by both wind and solar to generate hydrogen, electricity and ammonia.  Here[1] is the AES Andes press release about this project, if you care to read the opposing spin on this matter:"AES Chile submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Chilean permitting authorities for a proposed industrial-scale green hydrogen project called Inna. The project, which is in early-stage development, could include a variety of solutions, including green hydrogen for export or domestic consumption, aligned with Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy."[1] https://www.aesandes.com/en/press-release/aes-andes-submits-...Land use.  It's not just a fossil fuel shill talking point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I lived in the Welsh countryside, there were occasional nights where I could not see my hand in front of my face. The requirements were that it was new moon, and that there was slight fog. We also lived deep in a valley, which helped. I had great fun navigating my way to the local pub in complete darkness.The odd thing is that when I recount that experience, some people refuse to believe me. Of course they are all city dwellers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be unthinkable to just NOT have bright lights pointed at the sky all night? Could they still do this project with severe restrictions on light emissions? If there’s some reason it absolutely must include hundreds of outdoor sodium vapor lights then build it somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42668953</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Cobol and its evolution into Cobvious, a modern programming language that retains the readability and business-oriented features of Cobol while incorporating modern programming concepts and practices. It highlights the potential of Cobvious to facilitate the use of legacy systems while enabling developers to write code that is easier to maintain and integrate with contemporary technologies. The purpose of the article is to explore the significance of reviving and adapting older programming languages to meet current software development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Header files are one of the things I miss the most about languages that aren't C. Having a very clear distinction between public and private, and interface and implementation is one of my favourite things about C code (at least the way I write it).Being able to just read through a library's .h files to know how to use it is really nice. Typically, my .h files don't really look like my .c files because all the documentation for how to use the thing lives in the .h file (and isn't duplicated in the .c file). It would be entirely possible to put this documentation into the .c file, but it makes reading the interface much less pleasant for someone using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the author has WAY more knowledge/experience than me on this and so I wonder how he would solve the following issues:Evaluating Constant Expressions- This seems really complicated...if you're working within a translation unit, thats much simplified, but then you're much more limited in what you can do without repeating a lot of code. I wonder how the author solves this.Compile Time Unit Tests- This is already somewhat possible if you can express your test as a macro, which if you add in the first point, then this becomes trivial.Forward Referencing of Declarations- I think there may be a lot of backlash to this one. The main argument against this is that it then changes the compiler from a one-pass to two pass compiler which has its own performance implications. Given the number of people who are trying to compile massive codebases and go as far as parallelizing compilation of translation units, this may be a tough pill for them to swallow. (evaluating constant expressions probably comes with a similar/worse performance hit caveat depending on how its done)Importing Declarations- This is a breaking change...one of the ways I have kind of implemented templating in C is by defining a variable and importing a c file, changing the variable, and then reimporting the same c file. Another thing I've done is define a bunch of things and then import the SQLite C Amalgamation and then add another function (I do this to expose a SQLite internal which isnt exposed via its headers). All of these use cases would break with this change.Are there any thoughts about these issues? Any ways to solve them perhaps?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write unit tests for my C code all that time. It's not difficult if you use a good build system and if you are willing to stomach some boilerplate. Here is one test from    my "test suite" for my npy library:    void
    test_load_uint8() {
        npy_arr *arr = npy_load("tests/npy/uint8.npy");
        assert(arr-&gt;n_dims == 1);
        assert(arr-&gt;dims[0] == 100);
        assert(arr-&gt;type == 'u');
        npy_free(arr);
    }
    int
    main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        PRINT_RUN(test_load_uint8);
        ...
    }

I know I could have some pre-processor generate parts of the tests, but I prefer to KISS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669637</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the holidays, we published a post[1] on using high-precision few-shot examples to get `gpt-4o-mini` to perform similar to `gpt-4o`. I just re-ran that same experiment, but swapped out `gpt-4o-mini` with `phi-4`.`phi-4` really blew me away in terms of learning from few-shots. It measured as being 97% consistent with `gpt-4o` when using high-precision few-shots! Without the few-shots, it was only 37%. That's a huge improvement!By contrast, with few-shots it performs as well as `gpt-4o-mini` (though `gpt-4o-mini`'s baseline without few-shots was 59% – quite a bit higher than `phi-4`'s).[1] https://bits.logic.inc/p/getting-gpt-4o-mini-to-perform-like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone blown away by how fast we got to running something this powerful locally? I know it's easy to get burnt out on llms but this is pretty incredible.I genuinely think we're only 2 years away from full custom local voice to voice llm assistants that grow with you like JOI in BR2049 and it's going to change how we think about being human and being social, and how we grow up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s odd that MS is releasing models they are competitors to OA. This reinforce the idea that there is no real strategic advantage in owning a model. I think the strategy is now offer cheap and performant infra to run the models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42642971</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of decentralized syndication as a potential solution to improve how content is shared across the internet. It highlights the limitations of current centralized platforms, which control content distribution and user engagement, leading to issues such as censorship and lack of control over personal data. The author advocates for a new protocol that fosters decentralized communication and collaboration, enabling users to retain ownership of their content and data while encouraging a more open and resilient internet ecosystem. The piece emphasizes the importance of developing such protocols for a fairer digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to have an RSS interface where I can republish articles to a number of my own feeds (selectively or automatically). Then I can follow some my friends' republished feeds.I feel like the "one feed" approach of most social platform is not here to benefit users but to encourage doom-scrolling with FOMO. It would be a lot harder for them to get so much of users' time and tolerance for ads if it were actually organized. But it seems to me that there might not be that much work needed to turn an RSS reader into a very productive social platform for sharing news and articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While everyone is waiting for Atproto to proto, ActivityPub is already here. This is giving me "Sumerians look on in confusion as god creates world" vibes.https://theonion.com/sumerians-look-on-in-confusion-as-god-c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its not obvious to me that what is missing here is another technical protocol rather than more effective 'social protocols'. If you havent noticed, the major issues of today is not the scaling of message passing per-se but the moderation of content and violations of the boundary between public and private. These issues are socially defined and cannot be delegated to (possibly algorithmic) protocols.In other words what is missing is rules, regulations and incentives that are adapted to the way people use the digital domain and enforce the decentralized exchange of digital information to stay within a consensus "desired" envelope.Providing capabilities in code and network design is ofcourse a great enabler, but drifting into technosolutionism of the bitcoin type is a dead end. Society is not a static user of technical protocols. If left without  matching social protocols any technical protocol will be exploited and fail.The example of abusive hyperscale social media should be a warning: they emerged as a behavior, they were not specified anywhere in the underlying web design. Facebook is just one website after all. Tim Berners-Lee probably did not anticipate that one endpoint would succesfully fake being the entire universe.The deeper question is, do we want the shape of digital networks to reflect the observed concentration or  real current social and economic networks or do we want to use the leverage of this new techology to shape things in a different (hopefully better) direction?The mess we are in today is not so much failure of technology as it is digital illiteracy, from the casual user all the way to the most influential legal and political roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42654891</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing trend of governments demanding backdoors in encryption technologies, which compromises data security for users. It highlights the potential risks and dangers of implementing such backdoors, including the vulnerability to cyberattacks and exploitation by malicious actors. The piece also examines various case studies and examples where government pressures have led to weakened security measures, stressing the importance of maintaining strong encryption to protect privacy and security in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To avoid my comment being entirely a terminology nitpick I will say this is very cool work that I would be too afraid of CFAA to ever attempt. Especially funny to see four parasites on one government domain. Do skiddies not excise other skiddies' backdoors when pwning systems so they can have them all to themselves?&gt; We then hooked that up to the AWS Route53 API, and just bought them en-masse. Honestly, it’s $20, and we’ve done worse with more.&gt; We’re incredibly grateful for the support of The Shadowserver Foundation, who have agreed yet again to save us from our own adventures and to take ownership of the domains implicated in this research and sinkhole them.I wish we could collectively stop using the terms “buy” and “own” with regard to domains. Try “leased” or “rented”. If they could be bought then they wouldn't have been available again for this exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved this write up. Light-hearted. Conscious of the impact of any disclosure. Everything substantiated, but not taking themselves too seriously. Enjoying read, and at the same time talking about a serious issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder what would happen if they exploited these webshells' backdoors to delete the webshells...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674455</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's perspective on scheduling calls, emphasizing the importance of setting boundaries around time management. The author prefers to communicate through written formats, such as email or messaging, to foster clearer, more organized interactions. They advocate for acknowledging the potential inefficiencies of phone calls and suggest alternatives that can lead to more productive exchanges. The key message is to prioritize efficiency and respect for one's own time, encouraging others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone needs to write the other side of the story as a small startup owner having to deal with big businesses. It should feature:- Beeing asked for demos when they could have tried your free tier/trial and you have decent doc (They always prefer that you waste your time then asking someone on thier side to review)- Being used a price/feature comparison with your enterprise competitor just so they can get a better deal on their renewal (no stupid they never intended to change)- Having to fill endless security questionnaire without being sure you can even sell to them (what you dont love filling 100+ questions at 11PM on a Friday???).- Having to deal 3-6 months with procurement, often with one or two third party software resellers which only cares if he can make its margin (hello there CDW, no I wont lower my price 15% so you can make money)- Receiving the money 60-90 days after the deal close while you struggle with cashflow and you had to provide the service (and receiving a call from my bank rep to see why my margin and CC is full).I am sure I can think of more things. That is why I will absolutely charge an arm and leg to big businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against all of the advice in the world, I'm trying to set things up to avoid basically everything described in the article. It's tricky because the truth is that a lot of the tactics work and that is why companies implement them. A lot of investors also consider that process to be best-in-class and look for it as a sign of maturity.The counter approach is:
- Make complete information available as transparently as possible and don't gate it.
- Be forthcoming about weaknesses. Don't force prospects and customers to find them.
- Ensure that when a prospect or customer does want to talk to someone, they immediately reach someone who can handle the problem or answer the question (no need for escalations.)
- Never have an AI agent call someone unless the customer specifically requests that and be sure that all AI agents immediately disclose that they are AI.
- Offer flexible e-mail list subscription options (monthly, quarterly, annually, only release notes, etc.)
- If the product is not a fit, try to offer something useful anyway such as a suggestion of another product that might be a better match for their needs.Value based pricing is one of the reasons why a lot of companies end up in these situations. Rather than setting a standard price, the company does a detailed investigation of the customer to try to find out how much value they will gain from using the product and then they set the price based on that determination. Although it maximizes revenue in theory, it is slow and invasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate and nicely written article.There's a worse angle I've seen on the same story: A different engineer, who was already running the good open source solution successfully with their team, heard the other engineer had an enterprise sales assault dumped on them, for some load of trash, and so tried to sound the alarm, but it was already out of the other engineer's hands, because upper subtrees of the org chart had already signed on with political capital (and in a couple cases, it's somehow become an express personal performance metric that they spend the company's money on this specific product).  So all alternatives are blocked, everyone has to wait the next couple months for the sale to finalize, and then another month for IT to set up the SSO and databases, and forced to migrate from working solutions to garbage.  Then eventually the contract doesn't get renewed, with appropriate face-saving for those who pushed it through, but half the people upon whom it was inflicted have already found jobs in better companies, a quarter got PIP'd or stalled careers for being sabotaged by the trash, and the remaining quarter will mostly be laid off next year.Just say NO to enterprise sales.The only thing worse than having to do enterprise sales to sell your own product, is being the employees forced to use the likely bad purchasing decisions of other enterprise sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669754</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "killer UV feature" in the context of software development, specifically highlighting the importance of unique functionalities that can significantly enhance user experience and engagement. It outlines the criteria for identifying such features, emphasizing the need for innovation, user feedback, and practical application. The author shares insights into how to effectively implement these features, the potential impact on product success, and the role of market research in shaping their development. It serves as a guide for developers looking to create standout attributes that resonate with users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like uv, and it's the first package manager for a while where I haven't felt like it's a minor improvement on what I'm using but ultimately something better will come out a year or two later. I'd love if we standardized on it as a community as the de facto default, especially for new folks coming in. I personally now recommend it to nearly everyone, instead of the "welllll I use poetry but pyenv works or you could use conda too"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually stay away far FAR from shiny new tools but I've been experimenting with uv and I really like it. I'm a bit bummed that it's not written in Python but other than that, it does what it says on the tin.I never liked pyenv because I really don't see the point/benefit building every new version of Python you want to use. There's a reason I don't run Gentoo or Arch anymore. I'm very happy that uv grabs pre-compiled binaries and just uses those.So far I have used it to replace poetry (which is great btw) in one of my projects. It was pretty straightforward, but the project was also fairly trivial/typical.I can't fully replace pipx with it because 'uv tool' currently assumes every Python package only has one executable. Lots of things I work with have multiple, such as Ansible and Jupyterlab. There's a bug open about it and the workarounds are not terrible, but it'd be nice if they are able to fix that soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heck, you can get even cleaner than that by using uv’s support for PEP 723’s inline script dependencies:  # /// script
  # requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "pandas",
  # ]
  # ///

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses why the Mac Mini G4 is considered the best classic Macintosh for retro gaming enthusiasts. It highlights the device's compact design, versatility, and performance capabilities that make it suitable for playing older games. The author also mentions compatibility with various software and emulators, as well as the ability to connect to modern displays. Overall, the piece emphasizes the Mac Mini G4 as a solid choice for those looking to enjoy retro gaming on a classic Macintosh system.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great comprehensive article on the "why" and there are good YouTube videos on the "how." What the article is missing that makes it even better is putting an SSD in which makes it even faster of course. You can get an untested Mac mini G4 for about $60 on eBay and the rest of the parts (SSD, PATA-mSATA adapter, RAM if less than 1 GB, power adapter, any missing screws, clock battery, etc.) will run you another $60 to make the ultimate Mac OS 9 machine. If you're comfortable taking things apart and putting them back together it's not too bad.A quick tip: be sure to reset the PRAM with command-alt-p-r holding down during restart until you hear 3 chimes. Then while the machine is booting hold down command-alt-o-f and type "reset-nvram" and then "set-defaults" and then "reset-all" (all of this is in open firmware) before installing Mac OS 9 to make sure firmware is in its original state.I came across this idea of SSD upgrading and installing Mac OS 9 in April 2024 and bought three broken ones to build one for my son. [0] When the first one worked, I ended up figuring, why not just finish the other two and sell them on eBay?That led me into a hobby business. I've now cleaned, upgraded with SSDs, and sold about 70 of them. The "business" basically breaks even, so it truly is a hobby. In fact I invested so much in inventory buying 90 of them in a lot at the end of 2024 that I am negative right now. I will probably turn a slight profit in 2025. But it's fun and if you want you can buy one from me at:
https://os9.shopSorry for the self-promotion, but very relevant!0: https://x.com/davekopec/status/1795872492386398683&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The depth of this article is wonderful. The PowerPC line did have lots of good things going for it, and the Mac mini G4 is a good example of how much you can get done with modest space, power and heat.I'm still using Mac mini G4s in several places, both for Mac OS X (legacy Final Chop) and as small, low power servers running NetBSD.There are really only two drawbacks to the Mac mini G4, in my opinion:Gigabit ethernet would've been a dollar or two more? Being stuck with 100 Mbps, or around 300 Mbps if one uses a gigabit USB adapter, isn't fun.If the DIMM slot could take 2 gig DIMMs, this'd be a perfect machine. Other PowerPC Macs could take 2 gigs - heck, even the older PowerPC 604e Power Macs 9500 and 9600 could take 1.5 gigs - so being limited to 1 gig is a bit unfortunate, especially considering that 2 gig DDR DIMMs are a thing (later Xserve G5 units could take 2 gig DDR DIMMs).Still, the Mac mini G4 is the only computer aside from SBCs that I've bought brand new, and I have always been very happy with my decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a 2002 TiBook[1]; it officially supports MacOS 9.2.2, but also every OS X release up to 10.5.8. I've been surprised to find that the retail copy of StarCraft that I bought in 2009 not only includes an OS X build, but also supports PowerPC![1]: https://www.rollc.at/posts/2024-07-02-tibook/I'm not sure if it can be made to run m68k apps "natively", but on the other hand you can emulate just about any classic MacOS in a modern browser[2].[2]: https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674385</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the state of internet protocol address allocation as of January 2025, focusing on the current trends in address distribution and management by various regional internet registries (RIRs). It highlights the challenges posed by IPv4 address exhaustion and the transition to IPv6. The piece emphasizes the importance of efficient address allocation for internet service providers (ISPs) and the ongoing efforts to facilitate the broader adoption of IPv6 to ensure sufficient address availability for future internet growth. Additionally, it provides statistics and analysis on address usage, availability, and the impacts of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this blog does not accurately describe how large the ipv6 address space even after accounting for it being reduced by 2^64 for the host portion of the address. If it did it would make the concerned comments about /28 ipv6 network sizes seem very misplaced.A single static ipv4 address is a /32 slice into the ipv4 space and is considered a reasonable to size give out to a single person or even a small business that asks for it. Of course larger companies and telecom operators need larger network allocations and they have gotten them for many years in the past.Now realize that if a /64 ipv6 network is the minimum size like a single ipv4 address then you see that the ipv6 address space has 2^32  /32 ipv6 networks. Now with ipv6 any technical person and acquire a entire ipv4 internet sized network in a continuous (globally routeable if you want) range.And if any sized business today can expect buy a single "class c" /24 range of ipv4 it makes sense that large global compaines get a ipv6 /20 network to run their entire network on it.For example cloudflare[1] uses 6 regional /32 networks and a /29 network for all their routing needs. Imaging trying to build cloudflare with less than 32 addresses in a single /24 ipv4 allocation.ipv6 is so large that you can just design your network without worrying about subnet size and route based on real policy or security boundaries alone. We will run out of MAC addresses before we run out of ipv6[1] https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeing the domain which screams Australian (potaroo, quoll, quokka, et al) I looked at the author's name which brought back a few memories :-)For general interest, this is (among other accolades) 2012 Internet Hall of Fame Inductee Geoff Huston https://www.internethalloffame.org/official-biography-geoff-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how the IPv4 price has pulled back 30% since early 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670468</guid></item><item><title>13.

I first published them in 2010!To those in the comments who mentioned you are just starting your own PhD: Good luck to you! And, I hope you, like I once did, find a problem that you can fall in love with for a few years.To those just finished: Congratulations! Don’t forget to keep pushing!To those many years out: You have to keep pushing too, but there can be tremendous value in starting all over again by pushing in a different direction. You have no idea what you may find between the tips of two fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I can attest that nowadays, in some fields, research has become a 'game', where:- people torture data until it yields unreproducible results;- people choose venues that maximise their chances of getting published (and pay for publication sometimes, I'm looking at you, APC);- little concern given to excellence, rigour, and impact;- the chase for a 'diploma' from a renowned institute without putting the effort;I could go on and on, but I'll stop now.Perhaps something changes, I am waiting for this to happen for some time now (10y and counting).It's a bad system but that's what we have (at the moment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm starting a PhD — essentially from tomorrow. It's a shame to see so much discouragement here, but at this point I'm no longer surprised. I also don't care because if left to my own devices I would do research anyway.In the kindest possible way: screw all of you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42671512</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;In her article, Rachel discusses the concept of "lag" in the context of programming languages and development processes, emphasizing how the perception of time can differ based on various factors, such as project complexity and one's level of experience. She reflects on her own experiences with lag when learning new technologies and tools, highlighting the importance of patience and continuous learning in overcoming these challenges. By sharing her insights, she aims to encourage others to embrace the learning curve and recognize that progress can take time, often leading to deeper understanding and mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

remote filesystem syncs and cryptography problems where machines are
out of sync. My GPS wall clock is handy for adjusting NTP, but the
time it takes to scan my eyes from the wall back to the monitor.. you
really do need two stacked like she did. So I now figured to use
transparrent terminals each logged into a different host and lay them
over one another running "watch -n1 date".Would have been nice to have some more network, code and command line
examples.  You need to set up a local ntpd and need to point your
local master at that temporarily. A better utility to write would be
"timediff -s1 -s2" that takes two time servers and shows the offset. I
bet there's a way to do that in one line. Anyone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a standard "smearing" period now? For a while, Google had a 24 hour adjustment period, 12 hours on each side of the leap second, while Facebook used a shorter period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650732</guid></item><item><title>15.

I went through several rounds and was basically ghosted after the 4th with no explanation or follow up. The last interview was to write an blog post for their blog which I submitted and then didn’t hear back until continuously nagging months later. It was pretty disheartening since all of the interviews were some form of a take-home and I spent a combined total of ~10 hours or more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo on the homepage for the completion of the findMaxElement function is a good example of what is to come. Or maybe where we are at now?The six lines of Python suggested for that function can also be replaced with a simple “return max(arr)”. The suggested code works but is absolute junior level.I am terrified of what is to come. Not just horrible code but also how people who blindly “autocomplete” this code are going to stall in their skill level progress.You may score some story points but did you actually get any better at your craft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never imagined our project would make it to the HN front page on Sunday!Tabby has undergone significant development since its launch two years ago [0]. It is now a comprehensive AI developer platform featuring code completion and a codebase chat, with a team [1] / enterprise focus (SSO, Access Control, User Authentication).Tabby's adopters [2][3] have discovered that Tabby is the only platform providing a fully self-service onboarding experience as an on-prem offering.

The concept for anyone as unfamiliar with it as me is that lots of people pay a few hundred dollars each to get a small part of a chip being made, and once it's made they receive the chip ready to use with their section everyone else's, too, with a way to choose which bit gets run.I know basically nothing about chip design, and I'm wondering if anyone could tell me: is this only useful for education purposes, for example learning how to make a chip that creates a donut on a screen, or are there people using Tiny Tapeout for useful projects, too?For each of their chip runs, they publish a list of the different people's projects that got included - https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ - but it's not easy to spot which ones might be more than somebody just learning how to play with chip design.Essentially, if someone were to pick this up as a hobby, what is the most interesting thing they could make using this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yay, a1k0n!Long time since AI Challenge, I see you're dabbling into hardware too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So great to see this excellent explanation.  Have been a fan of donut.c since it first came out.  Also I'm way better at golfing js than c so it kinda feels like you wrote this just for me :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675208</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical significance of a simple animal guessing game created in the 1980s, which served as a precursor to modern machine learning. It highlights how this game utilized an early form of artificial intelligence by allowing players to guess animals based on their characteristics, while the system learned from mistakes and improved over time. This innovation laid the groundwork for later advances in AI, illustrating how foundational ideas in machine learning existed before the technology gained widespread popularity. The piece reflects on the evolution of AI and its roots in playful experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In two places the article states that the original game had the ability to save the updated tree ("it had the ability to save progress and load it during the next run" and "It is an amazing example... of how, even with such a simple language, ... and the ability to save new questions").The later part says the opposite - that the original implementation had "No ability to save progress" and that this is new in the C++ implementation.I can't help but wonder (also due to other language features) if the author ran the article through an AI to 'tidy up' before posting... because I've often found ChatGPT etc. to introduce changes in meaning like this, rather than just rewriting. This is not to dismiss either the article or the power of LLM's, just a curious observation :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like "Pervading Animal" (or just "Animal") from the 1970's [1].

&lt;p&gt;The article "Life in Console" by Eugene Andrienko explores the concept of using command-line interfaces (CLI) as a powerful tool for productivity and efficiency in computing. Andrienko discusses the advantages of working with consoles, including faster navigation and control over system processes compared to graphical user interfaces (GUI). He emphasizes the learning curve associated with mastering CLI tools but argues that the investment in learning can lead to significant improvements in workflow and problem-solving. The piece serves as both an introduction and a motivational piece for those looking to enhance their skills in using command-line resources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I have been using Linux since 1996 or so, and do have quite an opinionated workflow, I never could agree with this kind of ultraconservative approach to things. History never stops. Things change. Linux changes. Not every day, not every month, but every couple of years something has to go. And that's ok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have found openbsd to be one of the best unix desktop systems. Which is strange as that is not something they advertise as being good at. A large part of this is familiarity with the system(surprise, if you use a system a lot, you get comfortable with it) but some of it is this subtle feeling that the developers actually use it as a daily driver, which is often not the case with many linux systems.Now there are some huge caveats to this statement, When I say unix desktop I mean fairly bare bones terminal heavy classic unix type operating environment, If you want something more like a mac or windows desktop, but don't want to use mac or windows, than a linux distro offering that is probably more suitable. But openbsd does.. ok... here as well.Most problems with the heavy wimp style desktop environments are system administration related, where they don't understand openbsd system administration. personally I prefer cli based administration tools, and get a bit agitated when I have to worry about conflicting with some unknown desktop manager app that also wants to admin the system. So this works out great for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thats a long time to spend in it. Likely stuck trying to quit vim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674153</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a Python implementation of the classic snake game, designed for educational purposes. It features a simple graphical interface and is built using the Pygame library, allowing users to see the mechanics of game development while enabling them to play and modify the game. The documentation includes setup instructions, gameplay controls, and guidance for further development, making it a useful resource for both beginners and those looking to enhance their programming skills in game design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We’re an inverted organization. That means that tactical decisions are made by the people who are doing the work, not managersI've worked at various places where this was supposedly the system.Guess who had budgets, hiring powers, went to leadership offsites? Yeah not the ICs. It usually just means the C level will smile and nod while "listening" to your feedback instead of ignoring you completelyHas anyone worked at a true inverted company where centuries of classical power structures are thrown out the window?I feel it can never be properly implemented unless in eg a cooperative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but not surprising, that Agility only made place 5, way behind Quality. It will soon be a quarter of a century since the Agile Manifesto has been published.  It would be sad if we hadn't progressed since then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that they have a programming philosophy that they want people at the company to adopt. A common problem I see at companies that don't have onboarding is that people join the team with assumptions from previous jobs but you never level set them with the company. So 12 months down the line the new guy wants to change the process and you have to repeat the same discussions about what agile means for the nth time.Amazon does a good job of training new hire on the 'Amazon way'. Amazon does 6 pagers, they do design docs. Amazon does SOA. Amazon does not use relational databases. Everything has an API. Because of the 'Amazon way' and the training they do new team members understand at least some of the context and expectations.Is it the best way? Probably not but no one knows what the best way is anyway. At least they have a way. Saves a lot of effort compared to every new hire relitigating the process and architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676123</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Rewilding the Self" explores the concept of rewilding as a means to reconnect individuals with their natural instincts and surroundings. It discusses how modern society often suppresses innate human behaviors and encourages disconnection from nature. The author advocates for practices that promote self-discovery and a deeper relationship with the environment, emphasizing the importance of mindfulness, community, and authentic experiences in fostering a more balanced and fulfilling life. Through rewilding, individuals can reclaim their true selves and enhance their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are nature. The separation between humanity and nature is a false one, that works against conservation efforts.I like the idea of rewilding because it forces us to see ourselves as part of a large natural system - which is what we are - and helps grow appreciation for that system.But until there is a way for recognition of that system to become more profitable than "othering" nature - polluting the environment, destroying parts of that system - or regulation prevents that othering, it can be depressingly isolating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My problem with the term “ecological balance” is that it doesn’t exist. It’s a mythical term that seems invented by Disney. Nature is brutal. Populations will get wiped out, species will disappear.That’s exactly why having a lot of species is important. But it’s hardly balanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the world's population now exceeding 8 billion, we need to be thoughtful about the best way to rewild ourselves. We can live in dense cities with concrete high-rises but animals can't. Many animals at the top of the food chain need significant ranges for themselves. So the challenge is finding a way that we can minimize our footprint while also providing more opportunities for legitimate connection with nature. Put another way, a bimodal life - with time split between a concrete high-rises and natural areas is probably more ideal for the overall system than a push for everyone to live in slightly more rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672758</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the prevalent issue of spam and misleading extensions on Google's Chrome Web Store, highlighting how these extensions can compromise user security and privacy. It details cases where some of these harmful extensions, despite violating store policies, have gained significant popularity and visibility, raising concerns about Google's review and moderation processes.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have two Chrome extensions in the store. They're not very popular and are really just features I wanted for my own use. I think I have less than 100 users total.At least once a week I get emails from people- offering money to add their "tracking" code- wanting to purchased the extension outrightWhat they clearly want is access to my modest install base to push questionable code onto. I certainly am not going for these offers, but I could certainly see someone less financially secure giving in to it, and that scares me a little.The idea of paid malware insertion in smaller packages is kind of troubling in general. How often just in life in general do we just trust opaque binaries to be clean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These rogue extensions are "surreptitiously monetizing web searches" - but doesn't Google conspicuously monetize web searches?So it seems the Google TOS bans competition in search monetization using their "open source" browser. Isn't it odd that an "open source" browser is apparently designed to provide a monopoly on search monetization by the nice people who give it to you for free?And being 80% or so of all searches:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-...It seems like Peter Thiel's claim that google is a search advertising monopoly masquerading as a (competitive, non-monopoly) technology company might be spot on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google would prefer to focus on limiting ad blockers with V3 instead of protecting users from these extensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640207</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This advice to quit social media is always a hit on HN. When I was 10 years younger I read the same thing on HN, was thoroughly convinced and quit social media. I even followed the advice of trying to stay in touch by email. Sure.Turns out that a lot of people I knew posted huge life updates that I completely missed out on. I asked them why they didn’t tell me and they were confused. They said the posted it on social media. I can’t speak for everyone, but I know a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely. I have a few close friends and that’s it.Maybe that’s an ok tradeoff to make, but it’s worth knowing that before getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When something is used by billions of people its kinda futile to argue about its utility. But then billions are addicted to tobacco, alcohol, drugs, gambling etc. and those benefitting from providing these "services" will do everything they can to keep people addicted while arguing that they are solving a real problem.The reality is always a mundane core that gets complicated by human tragicomedy. Ofcourse its wholesome to be able to connect digitally with friends and family. Its also a great economic enabler to connect digitally with professionals. Or to be able to publish to a bulleting board about your brilliant accomplishments.But to paraphrase Gates, we need these connections, we don't need the self-appointed universal connectors.Its 2025, and this is HN. I put it to you that technically the only thing preventing us today from having good "connections infrastructure" is the corrupting influence of big adtech. One possible vision of how to organize the digital space in technical and economic terms had become the only vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to be a producer more than a consumer. I produce videos (admittedly that are technical and dry) so it's not like I get hundreds of thousands of views.On my downtime I still participate in social media though usually anonymously in the form of shit posting. Or just watching YouTube. I did get sucked into that crap of posting everyday about my glamorous life. Eventually I found I didn't know what to post anymore. Had to find something to post. I'm glad I never got sucked into it completely like TikTok/Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677587</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer per process over the alternatives.When you write code you have the choice to do per process, per thread, or sequential.The problem is that doing multiple tests in a shared space doesn't necessarily match the world in which this code is run.Per process testing allows you to design a test that matches the usage of your codebase. Per thread already constrains you.For example: we might elect to write a job as a process that runs on demand, and the library we use has a memory leak, but it can't be fixed in reasonable time. Since we write it as a process that gets restarted we manage to constrain the behavior.Doing multiple tests in multiple threads might not work here as there is a shared space that is retained and isn't representative of real world usage.Concurrency is a feature of your software that you need to code for. So if you have multiple things happening, then that should be part of your test harness.The test harness forcing you to think of it isn't always a desirable trait.That said, I have worked on a codebase where we discovered bugs because the tests were run in parallel, in a shared space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A much better model still is a mixture.* Use multiple processes, but multiple tests per process as well.* Randomly split and order the tests on every run, to encourage catching flakiness. Print the seed for this as part of the test results for reproducibility.* Tag your tests a lot (this is one place where, as many languages provide, "test classes" or other grouping is very useful). Smoke tests should run before all other tests, and all run in one process (though still in random order). Known long-running tests should be tagged to use a dedicated process and mostly start early (longest first), except that a few cores should be reserved to work through the fast tests so they can fail early.* If you need to kill a timed-out test even though other tests are still running in the same process - just kill the process anyway, and automatically run the other tests again.* Have the harness provide fixtures like "this is a temporary directory, you don't have to worry about clearing it on failure", so tests don't have to worry about cleaning up if killed. Actually, why not just randomly kill a few tests regardless?I wrote some more about tests here [1], but I'm not sure I'll update it any more because of Github's shitty 2FA-but-only-the-inconvenience-not-the-security requirement.[1]: https://gist.github.com/o11c/ef8f0886d5967dfebc3d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nextest is one of the very small handful of tools I use dozens or hundreds of times a day. Parallelism can reduce test suite execution time significantly, depending on your project, and has saved me cumulative days of my life. The output is nicer, test filtering is nicer, leak detection is great, and the developer is friendly and responsive. Thanks sunshowers!The one thing we've had to be aware of is that the execution model means there can sometimes be differences in behaviour between nextest and cargo test. Very occasionally there are tests that fail in cargo test but succeed in nextest due to better isolation. In practice this just means that we run cargo test in CI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649139</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that the "cargo cult" metaphor, commonly used to describe the adoption of superficial practices without understanding their underlying principles, is becoming outdated and counterproductive. It discusses how this metaphor often leads to dismissing innovative ideas and practices instead of fostering a deeper understanding of their significance. The author emphasizes the need for a more constructive approach in discussions about technology and methodologies, advocating for embracing new concepts rather than clinging to outdated metaphors that hinder constructive dialogue and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nah, we better abandon this kind of retroactive policing of language instead from people with nothing better to do.Nobody who uses the term "cargo cult" in a technical settings does it out of spite or even refers to specific nations or peoples. Just refers to the core takeaway of a practice which might as we be all lore.Care about politics and colonialism and injustice and what have you? There are 1000000 causes you could devote your time and make an active  difference to people actually suffering this very moment, rather than language policing tech terms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I this post has enabled me to put my finger on what makes me uncomfortable about  articles like this.Even though I frequently understand and sympathise with the goals and feelings of the writers, there are two factors that stand out.1.  A sense of certainty of the causal nature of the issues at hand.  It comes across that the author has concluded the correct course of action.2.  Everybody, including you,  should follow their concluded course of action.I would be fine with an article talking about what the cargo cult metaphor means, its historical accuracy and how the author thinks that impacts upon people.   It would then seem to be quite reasonable for them to say that they are going to cease using the metaphor because of those reasons, and to invite people to consider doing the same if they think the reasons seem valid to them.It's ok to say"I think this, so I'm going to change my behaviour"It seems unreasonable to say."I think this, so everyone should change their behaviour"Unfortunately it feels like we are heading to"I know this, so everyone should change their behaviour"The call for everyone else to change is backed by the certainty of their opinion.  It presents complainants as wanting you to do their thing not because it's their opinion,  it's because it is undeniable fact.  It places you as morally deficient if you disagree.This affects things large and small,  whether people want you to boycott a brand of toothpaste, or talk about milliBTC as the base unit of bitcoin,  or talk about the topic they are uninterested in in a different forum.    The solution is simple, everyone has to do this simple act of my bidding.Surely if the case for the damage caused by the cargo cult metaphor were to be made clearly and undeniable,  people would not need to be told to stop using it,  They just would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nope, we’re not doing this in 2025.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the Chatham House Rule, which is designed to encourage open dialogue by allowing participants to speak freely without attribution. It highlights how this principle is often applied in discussions but can inadvertently contribute to a sense of burnout among attendees who feel pressured to engage without the chance to express themselves fully. The piece emphasizes the importance of balancing open communication with the well-being of participants, suggesting that organizers should find ways to alleviate pressure and foster meaningful interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not new. Many of the mailing lists that dominated the discourse of the early Internet in the 1990s operated under a similar rule. The novelty is that it disappeared almost entirely for decades.The original purpose (on the Internet) was to create a space where complex ethical and moral questions could be explored and discussed in depth without risk of someone taking a hypothetical statement out of context to slander you, as people are wont to do. It would be orders of magnitude worse in this current age of people obsessed with generating click-bait for engagement, which wasn’t a thing back then. I personally found that environment to be intellectually stimulating and rigorous, I miss the standard of discourse of those days.Chatham House Rule is going back to the old Internet, which valued novel insight and reasoned discourse highly, before the masses took over the Internet. The purpose was not to enable edgelords. Rational defense of ideas, statements, and hypotheses was expected and table stakes. Related rules of that era, such as Crocker’s Rule[0], placed responsibility on the reader to address uncomfortable or offensive feedback in the most dispassionate way possible.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12881288&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Denunciations of the Chatham House Rule seem underdeveloped. According to the history on Wikipedia, it was invented to let members of post-WW1 English civic society discuss and debate potential reforms, and then get as much of that discussion into the public record as desired without having individual members pilloried for things they said during the discussion, even if the rest of the group disagreed with them.This doesn’t even seem unique. Newspaper editorial boards don’t assign individual names to editorials or sentences thereof. Individual members of Congressional commissions aren’t cited for the sentences they (or their staff) committed to reports.Chatham House Rule, meet Chesterton’s Fence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems pretty obvious why in a world where if you misspeak or say something ill considered it can be all over twitter and have serious personal and professional ramifications.Regardless of how well meaning people are in their desire to hold people to account for bad views, it does have a chilling effect, and you can't learn if you don't have a safe place to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669027</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the probabilities associated with token generation in large language models (LLMs). It explores how LLMs predict the next token based on context, detailing the statistical methods involved and the implications of token selection on model performance. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these probabilities for optimizing LLM applications and improving their effectiveness in various tasks. Additionally, the article potentially covers practical examples and mathematical frameworks that illustrate these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

In the CoT summary it acknowledges that the most recent official information is 1611m, but it then chooses to say 1622 because it's more commonly cited. It's like it over-thinks itself into the wrong answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bank account anchoring bias may be just the base model predicting as best as it can, as OP described earlier. Imagine a random Internet page where you read "There is V in my X. The Y of Z A, in Bs, is _." What do you expect? V, of course! Because why would a person on the Internet ever join these two factoids if they were totally unrelated (as they are in fact in this example)? That would be a gross violation of basic writing and human communication norms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42653744</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that utilizes virtualization to compartmentalize different tasks into isolated environments called qubes. This design enhances security by preventing malware or other threats from affecting the entire system. Qubes OS allows users to run various operating systems simultaneously and supports secure application management, making it particularly suitable for users with high security needs, such as developers or cybersecurity professionals. The website provides resources, documentation, and community support for both new and experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have used it for several months as my daily OS and dropped it because of bad graphics performance (only software rendering supported, many frame drops when watching HD videos on YT) and bad battery management. Due to software rendering the overall systems perfmance also dropped. So I cannot recommend it for people with high requirements on graphics and battery duration. Besides that it was an interesting and good experience.I think it would be good to make it possible to deactivate certain security features such as strict graphics isolation so that users can adjust their settings to their risk acceptance level. It would also be interesting to be able to optionally replace Xen with lighter isolation mechanisms, even if the user would compromise on security here too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We wouldn't have to rely on security by hypervisor if linux had proper security measures, sandboxing and access controls OOTB. Qubes is still far from good although it's slowly getting there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though I never used Qubes OS I used to really enjoy Joanna Rutkowska's passion for it.Other women who's computing enthusiasm I enjoyed was Jessie Frazelle's writing and speaking about running everything in Docker on her laptop and Sacha Chua's love for Emacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677608</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent decision by Matt Mullenweg to shut down the WordPress Sustainability Team, which has sparked significant backlash within the WordPress community. Critics argue that this move undermines efforts to make the platform more environmentally friendly and threatens the broader mission of promoting sustainable practices. The article highlights various responses from community members who are disappointed with the decision and emphasizes concerns over the future of sustainability initiatives within WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a piece yesterday about the recent WordPress drama, including this bit. A fun thing I learned while digging into it is that Mullenweg himself requested that the Slack channel for this team be set up live on stage at WordCamp Europe in 2022. When disbanding the team, Mullenweg said, “today I learned that we have a sustainability team”. Maybe he forgot, but setting up this team was — at least in part — his idea.https://anderegg.ca/2025/01/11/wordpress-is-in-trouble&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't really understand what a "WP Sustainability Team" was, so I clicked the link to the linked website in this story. I was surprised that it was in fact an initiative to do things like "have a dashboard that shows the climate impact of publishing" and "promote static publishing over..." I assume because serving this content (under someone's model) uses less electricity?Hey - if this is important to you, by all means pursue this direction, but I would cut this sort of initiative too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher has described Matt Mullenweg’s move to shut down WordPress’s sustainability team as “bizarrely heinous behavior.”Is it bizarrely heinous? Or is it just kind of bad? I enjoy WordPress drama, and run a couple of lazy WordPress services, but I don't think that this is actually worth all the spilt ink and tears, relative to all the other injustices a person might choose to concern themselves with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672675</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Microsoft Bob, an early attempt by Microsoft to create a user-friendly graphical interface for Windows in the mid-1990s. Aimed at non-technical users, Bob featured a cartoonish design and a simple layout with an emphasis on ease of use. However, it faced significant criticism for being overly simplistic and not meeting the needs of its target audience, which contributed to its poor sales and eventual discontinuation. The article positions Microsoft Bob as one of the company's most notable product failures, highlighting its ambitious intent overshadowed by its execution shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft never really left the dream of creating Bob behind. If you look at their Virtual Reality Portal it is basically a modern version of Bob where you start in a livingroom and need to go into into other rooms to perform certain task. To start apps you eg. need to pick them from a book shelf. Essential the same a Bob.A few images for reference. Notice that you start MS Paint same way in the VR portal and Bob.VR Portal:
https://onewindows.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/windows-mix...Bob: https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/upl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had Bob in an attempt to make my technophobic mother capable of using the computer.My main memory of it was that it allowed you to add shortcuts to other installed programs, so I added the few games on the computer to Bob. This used way too many resources, causing Bob to crash and me being unable to get into my profile to fix it. It may have broken the program for anyone else using it too, I can't recall. Relatively standard behavior crashing the program far beyond their target market's ability to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimmed it quickly and saw it taught Racket to teach programming design.I've worked at a coding bootcamp in 2017. And I have to say, I was a bit jealous. Where I was learning through methods at university that were a bit quaint, my students learned JS with the latest frameworks. And sure, you can argue whether the length of 3 months is enough, but they were surely getting a better education. What they learned in 3 months, took me at least 6 months to a year in terms of how useful it is.The thing is, especially as a beginner, learning any programming language will give you similar difficulties (glossing over some nuances). So why not just learn a practical one?I think once a student has had a practical programming course under their belt, only after that should more esoteric languages come to showcase certain concepts. I believe that they'd be more motivated to learn them as they're more into the groove of programming.And this is coming from someone that has programmed 2 years in Pharo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676928</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the famous wager between economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich regarding the future availability of natural resources and the impact of population growth on scarcity. Simon argued that human ingenuity and technological advancements would lead to resource abundance, while Ehrlich maintained that growing populations would deplete resources. The outcome of the bet, which focused on the prices of specific metals over a decade, ultimately favored Simon, illustrating the resilience of supply in the face of increasing demand and highlighting the role of innovation in resource management. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding population dynamics and resource distribution in addressing environmental and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

His most infamous was that "hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death" in the 1970s[0]. It’s curious how he managed to remain influential despite a track record of such inaccurate forecasts.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich#The_Population...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;| If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000I would love to know what it was about England that meant it's end was nigh, I mean what about France, Norway or Belgium ?Also, when he said "England" was he actually referring to the United Kingdom (as Americans often are) or were Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland going to be spared in some way ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's only one core problem in AI worth solving for most startups building AI powered software: context.No matter how good the AI gets, it can't answer about what it doesn't know.  It can't perform a process for which it doesn't know the steps or the rules.No LLM is going to know enough about some new drug in a pharma's pipeline, for example, because it doesn't know about the internal resources spread across multiple systems in an enterprise.  (And if you've ever done a systems integration in any sufficiently large enterprise, you know that this is a "people problem" and usually not a technical problem).I think the startups that succeed will understand that it all comes down to classic ETL: identify the source data, understand how to navigate systems integration, pre-process and organize the knowledge, train or fine-tune a model or have the right retrieval model to provide the context.There's fundamentally no other way.  AI is not magic; it can't know about trial ID 1354.006 except for what it was trained on and what it can search for.  Even coding assistants like Cursor are really solving a problem of  ETL/context and will always be.  The code generation is the smaller part; getting it right requires providing the appropriate context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this argument only makes sense if you believe that AGI and/or unbounded AI agents are "right around the corner".  For sure, we will progress in that direction, but when and if we truly get there–who knows?If you believe, as I do, that these things are a lot further off than some people assume, I think there's plenty of time to build a successful business solving domain-specific workflows in the meantime, and eventually adapting the product as more general technology becomes available.Let's say 25 years ago you had the idea to build a product that can now be solved more generally with LLMs–let's say a really effective spam filter.  Even knowing what you know now, would it have been right at the time to say, "Nah, don't build that business, it will eventually be solved with some new technology?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one thing ignored here is the value of UX.If a general AI model is a "drop-in remote worker", then UX matters not at all, of course. I would interact with such a system in the same way I would one of my colleagues and I would also give a high level of trust to such a system.If the system still requires human supervision or works to augment a human worker's work (rather than replace it), then a specific tailored user interface can be very valuable, even if the product is mostly just a wrapper of an off-the-shelf model.After all, many SaaS products could be built on top of a general CRM or ERP, yet we often find a vertical-focused UX has a lot to offer. You can see this in the AI space with a product like Julius.The article seems to assume that most of the value brought by AI startups right now is adding domain-specific reliability, but I think there's plenty of room to build great experiences atop general models that will bring enduring value.If and when we reach AGI (the drop-in remote worker referenced in the article), then I personally don't see how the vast majorities of companies - software and others - are relevant at all. That just seems like a different discussion, not one of business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672790</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat! A couple gameplay suggestions I would have is that while the game does pretty well figuring out which word I'm typing sometimes I will get "locked" on a word that I decide I don't actually want to complete (for example, if something is coming at me faster). And, while probably intentional, sometimes I just can't see words or there is some delay in when they actually get destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games like this based on an existing skill would really benefit from the ability to start at higher levels. I'm a pretty proficient typist, it'd be a lot more interesting to me if there was any risk at all of me failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The game doesn't penalize wrong key presses. I made an automation cheat for it back in Dec 2013!    import java.awt.*;
    
    public class autokey {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            // Give the user time to switch windows
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            
            // Repeatedly type the letters A through Z until the mouse is moved
            Robot rob = new Robot();
            Point prevLoc = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
            while (MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation().equals(prevLoc)) {
                for (int i = 'A'; i &lt;= 'Z'; i++) {
                    rob.keyPress(i);
                    Thread.sleep(1);
                }
                Thread.sleep(50);
            }
        }
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649837</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of invariants in programming, providing a detailed explanation of their importance in ensuring the correctness and reliability of algorithms. It clarifies what invariants are—conditions that remain true during the execution of a program or a portion of it—and discusses various types of invariants, such as loop invariants and class invariants. The author emphasizes the role of invariants in facilitating reasoning about code behavior, aids in debugging, and contributes to effective software design by promoting a clear understanding of how data and states are maintained throughout the program's lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure that I agree with the article.In the course of my work, I think of an invariant as a state that must hold true at all points during the software’s execution.For example, “port xxx must never accept inbound traffic”.I don’t think of invariants as mindsets; I think of them as runtime requirements that are observable and testable at any point during execution, and whose violation is an indication that some assumption about state that the proper execution of the software depends on, no longer holds.Maybe a good analogy would be “a runtime assert”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that the Ada language features baked-in pre- and post-condition invariants as a part of a function's signature. It goes beyond just runtime assertions by becoming a part of the function's contract with callers.https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/cont...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another way to view such invariant is to see it as a generalization of both pre-  as well as post-condition.The pre-condition is a special case, then the invariant provides the "guard rails" along which the computation proceeds, and then the post-condition is again a special case which ultimately is the result of the computation.In the search example of the computation, the pre-condition is "the position is somewhere in the allowed indices", the post-condition is "the return value is the position". The stated invariant is "the value is between current min and max bounds". These bounds become tighter and tighter, so that eventually the pre-condition is transformed into the post-condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640178</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a phone with a limited version of Android (Android Go) and only 2GB of RAM which isn't enough. It has a slow CPU, it lacks 5G connectivity which is more and more important just to have good reception. It comes with at most 2 years of security updates. It has 32GB of storage which quickly fill up if you take pictures every now and then.If you can afford it, get something like the Samsung A52 5G with 7 years of updates and 6GB or 8GB of RAM. If that's too expensive, get one from the list when it's on sale: https://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=umtsover&amp;v=e&amp;hloc=uk&amp;sort=p&amp;bl1...These are recently released phones with 6GB RAM or more and Android 14+ starting at £99. 6GB of RAM means you can use your phone for a couple of years without it getting super slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the issue with these low end devices are that the duopoly on operating systems makes it impossible to develop a competing operating system that get's any traction.I am 100% sure you, as a manufacturer, could develop a very lightweight shim over a linux or BSD kernel that has significantly better performance than Android does. It would however be a universal flop regardless of how useable it is since critical apps like WhatsApp/Telegram/banking would not get ported to that platform ever.That effectively leaves you with needing a capable web browser and well... Even Firefox with every form of adblocker enable regularly chews up 2-3 GB of ram for me, at least on desktop. And building a competitive web browser to Chromium is an absurd endeavour for a cheap cell manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HMD is a mobile phone brand; "Key" is a line of phones.I thought it was something like a YubiKey, but it appears instead to be a really cheap phone running Android Go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673090</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Working for Americans" by Sean Goedecke emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs and welfare of American citizens in policy-making and governance. It outlines strategies for improving economic opportunities, enhancing social services, and fostering community engagement to ensure that government actions directly benefit the populace. Goedecke advocates for transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in government decisions, arguing that a focus on American interests will lead to a stronger and more unified nation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am Brazilian-Australian, worked for a few years in Australia and then moved to Sweden and worked for an American company here.The company was Swedish, but was eventually acquired by an American corporation.One of the projects we were working on started getting delayed due to endless discussions about which tech to use and how to architect things (the companies used completely different stacks) so we could integrate everything. One day, we had a video call with one big Manager from Florida. The guy just started shouting like a maniac and treated everyone, including us and his American team, like crap.That was so incredibly surreal to everyone on our side, as even the tiniest raising of your voice in our office would've been extremely unusual, and Swedes are one of the most conflict-avoiding people you can find anywhere. After the call was over, everyone was all thinking like "what the fuck just happened" but no one said much at all... we just  kind of pretended that did not happen and slowly went back to playing some ping pong and calmly sitting at our desks and doing some work with headphones on.After a few months, only I was left on the team as everyone just found elsewhere to work.... I followed a couple of months after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an additional issue with timezones I'm surprised he didn't mention - you're off by a day. This means nobody is around on your Monday because it's US Sunday and conversely US Friday is your Saturday morning. This means you either need to adapt to having 4 days a week of overlap, or you need to shift your life to accomodate 7am meetings on a Saturday morning.There's also regular chaos with the mis-matched DST windows meaning meetings will swing about by 1-2 hours multiple times as the seasons change depending on whose calendar created them, it's manageable but inevitably there's misses and confusion or someone's 8am suddenly becomes a 6am without rescheduling.The bigger issue however is if you're the AU leg of a global firm with a US plurality: If there are teams in the UK or EU for example there's simply no way of operating with overlap that doesn't involve someone regularly having meetings in the deeply inhospitable early hours of the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one.In some sense this also fits under culture. The Australian government has historically been fairly technophobic (they really have a thing against privacy - the ban on effective encryption springs to mind, they've tried to ban Monero too but that doesn't work because crypto is too slippery). I also vaguely recall from years ago that we make it hard to use equity as a significant part of employee compensation. Overall Australia lacks the free-wheeling spirit of letting people do things that works so well in tech so I assume there are a lot of other small barriers I don't know about (eg, I'd bet companies like Uber would have been killed in the crib if it started in Australia). We also have a subtly anti-cheap-energy policy that must make life hard for data centres.We've produced some big tech success stories like Atlassian but when you combine dubious regulation with the larger US capital markets there isn't really much to recommend about Australia. I wouldn't suggest putting money into the Australian tech scene and the market has probably sniffed that out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669681</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Case for Letting Malibu Burn" argues that the natural cycle of wildfires is an essential aspect of California's ecosystem, particularly in areas like Malibu, where human intervention has increased fire risks and altered the landscape. It discusses the historical relationship between fire and the region's ecology, suggesting that allowing certain areas to burn can promote ecological health and prevent more destructive wildfires in the future. The piece also addresses the complex issues of property rights, environmental policy, and the increasing threat of climate change, calling for a reevaluation of fire management practices to prioritize ecological resilience over human development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; So why do people insist on rebuilding in the firebelt?Why do Floridians keep rebuilding in the wake of endless hurricanes? Why do folks live in Tornado Alley? Why do Dakotans endure one tragic winter after another? Why did New Orleans build back after yhe flooding?Man seeks to tame nature - to bend it to our will. Plus we'll take "build now, great views now" over "possible disaster later ".One could argue that nowhere is completely risk free, but it seems like the homing instinct (Plus the cultural instinct to build out of wood) is strong.It might be time to consider alternate building methods suitable for the risk of the area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So instead of a long-overdue debate about the wisdom of rebuilding and the need to prevent further construction in areas of extreme natural fire danger, public attention was diverted into a discussion of the best methods for clearing vegetation (rototillers or goats?) and making homes fire-resistant.Does anyone honestly think that debate has any actual chance of hapenning, even now? Malibu and the Pacific Palisades are some of the best real estate in the state if not the country. There’s always going to be someone willing to pay the rising cost of fire insurance and take the risk to live there. Short of the state buying out all the property owners or making that area uninsurable by CalFAIR, people are going to build. Not to mention the political connections they have.Altadena, on the other hand, was built where and how it was built because of segregationist redlining in Pasadena and South Pasadena. It’s a historically minority neighborhood that was only built so densely with so little fire protection because they couldn’t afford it and the state never gave them much help. It looks like once again our power companies are responsible for starting a destructive conflagration because they siphoned maintenance money to shareholders and executives (many of whom probably live in Malibu or the Palisades). Any state policy that tries to solve the Malibu/Palisades problem is going to disproportionately screw these low income communities that have built out around the edges. I’m betting that entire neighborhood will sell out to real estate developers building apartment complexes that can afford more expensive fire mitigations, destroying a historical community as much as any freeway and opening the door to tenement fires.This has all happened before and will happen again. I don’t really see a holistic solution that has any chance of passing public scrutiny and working, other than chipping away at the insurance regulator and CalFAIR, which will screw over the most vulnerable and entrench the real estate NIMBYs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It certainly feels like the need for climate change adaptation that's been foretold for years is starting to happen. There’s quite a bit of blame being thrown around regarding details like how much water was in the reservoir and the DEI stance of the fire chief, but does any of that really provide a sustainable solution?Maybe it’s time to confront the fact that people can’t continue to live in those areas without substantial changes in the build environment.The tragic reality of climate change is that despite well informed and well meaning people, no one actually wants to meaningfully change their own lifestyle to adjust to the consequences. Clear cutting trees for instance, can be a preventative measure, but I'm sure home owners in the area would protest the environmental impact, the loss of privacy, the change in their lifestyle.California has always been a state that, on paper, acknowledges the severity  of climate change, but thus far, has been fighting tooth and nail to keep homes in wildfire prone areas. What I worry about is that California chooses to create a public option for homeowners insurance that is tax payer funded to subsidize at risk homes, increasing costs for everyone else. To me this would just be another form of climate change denial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675274</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why you wouldn't deploy a spar horizontally, filled with dry ballast powder evenly along it's length, then tip it vertical once in position and pump in water to set the ballast. This seems an obvious approach, allowing use of a shallow dock ,so there must be some issue with it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this works, then why is tidal power not more widely used?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the designs presented for floating  oceanic wind turbine bases shows, that there is a need to have as much stability as possible, while
moving in response to wave action and tides.By default, all power generating equipment is 100% duty cycle , 24/7/365. For fixed land based machines the various loads and environmental wear
conditions are more or less predictable. Marine instalations on the other hand, are notorious for destroying anything and everything, very especialy
anything with moving parts, due to all of the land based factors, plus operating on an unpredictable moving platform.
 Total failure of the entire structure can be initiated by the failure of any one of many bearings/joints where movement between components takes place,deep underwater.
 Inspection becomes a challenge and service at sea impossible.
 The many failures of underwater tidal generators
bears testimony to the dificulties and challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655207</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a group of physicists advocating for a re-evaluation of the concept of dark energy, which is currently used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. They propose that instead of assuming the existence of dark energy, we should consider alternative theories of gravity that could potentially account for observational data without invoking this elusive substance. The physicists argue that by exploring these alternative frameworks, we might gain a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and the nature of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

They are sort of the default solution to a set of problems that exist in cosmology. In a sense, every physicist wants to ditch dark matter or dark energy (or at least our current understandings of them), but they just don't know what to replace them with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the better nautilus articles I’ve read, usually they’re unreadable and boring, despite an interesting title. Unsurprising that it was written by Sabine Hossenfelder. Good science communication is a real skill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every science documentary I've watched tells me most physicists want to ditch "dark energy" because it's a placeholder term for something we still don't understand yet.  Map-makers didn't actually believe there were dragons after all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672752</guid></item><item><title>46.

- it is annoying to have the "category" required to create a task. Maybe you could create a task with an "undefined" category if none provided?
- a great feature would be to be able to export the result output or view in a PNG picture or SVG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's really nice, such a good idea.Over the last 15 years the browser has become more and more of an application delivery platform, and that notion has caused SaaS to run basically everything.I realised this not too long ago, and incidentally it was due to gantt software.We, like everyone it seems, use Jira for issue tracking, but the actual roadmapping of resources and dependencies leaves a lot to be desired, tools like Microsoft Project are not only prohibitively expensive- they also don't work on MacOS.Similar issues can be levied at Omnigraph.Only SaaS tools like "InstaGantt" seem to fit the bill of cross-platform, lightweight and reasonably cost effective.Note: I'm currently not using Instagantt, despite it being the closest to good I could find, because I dislike subscriptions. :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me a little bit of https://markwhen.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been programming some CAD algorithms during the last two months and found myself buying cheap pens for a cheap plotter (a Silhouette machine), to make geometric diagrams. Can't say that the process is more efficient than a color printer[^1], but it is way cheaper than those damn color toners and the profit-maximizing ways the printer accounts for its consumption. And the pen strokes on paper look cool, and one can chose different pens to draw different layers in the diagrams.[^1]: Though, in truth, the plotter is extremely reliable and fast. Inkjet printers on the other hand have a lengthy warmup and drivers are finicky to the point one imagines they constantly are on the lookout for new ways to botch a job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used a standard Lamy fountain pen for 11 years in school, and later several higher-end products (ball pens and fountain pens). But a few years ago I discovered that I really like writing with the Bic Cristal [0]. It's reliable and writing feels very smooth (even better than with some Lamy products I own). I also like that it has exactly the same shape as a classic pencil. Of course it is also very relaxing to know I can get a pack of 50 for 14 EUR. You can gnaw away on it, roll over it accidentally with you chair, lose it, break it in half - doesn't matter, because you can easily afford to have 20 of these on your desk at any time.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had quite a few nice pens over the years. For me, Lamy Safari with its triangular grip is peak ergonomics, and its price-per-usability is fantastic. I tend to have a claw-like grip, and the Safari forces me to hold it in a way that my hand doesn't cramp after 3 minutes. It's great. I love it.But for quick jotting, like making shopping lists or bullet journal notetaking, I'm on board with this list's top ballpoint pick, the Uni Jetstream. If all ballpoints were this smooth and pleasant to use, I never would've bothered investigating fountain pens. I think they're fantastic, supremely reasonably priced, and rugged enough to lose in the bottom of a bag without leaking all over stuff.I love my Safaris, but when I need to jot something down, I reach for the Jetstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676274</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to say that I think the photo without the Ligthroom processing actually looks better. The second one hasn't just added a bitcoin, it has also added the "AI shimmer" that seems to be a part of a lot of generated images. I can't put my finger on exactly what the characteristic is, but my first instinct (separate from the bitcoin, which was hard to find) is "that's an AI picture." Someone should just spend some time in the blur tool if they don't like those glints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you zoom in and squint your eyes, it does look like some kind of shiny coin.What I'd like to know though... is how is the model so bad that when you tell it to "remove this artifact" ... instead of it looking at the surroundings and painting over with some DoF-ed out ocean... it slaps an even more distinct artifact in there? Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apparently this isn't an isolated incident: https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/1e5nyt7/generati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670132</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Whonix is a privacy-focused operating system designed to ensure anonymity while using the internet. It operates on the principle of isolation, utilizing two virtual machines: one to run applications (Workstation) and another to route internet traffic through the Tor network (Gateway). This architecture prevents potential IP address leaks and enhances user security. The Whonix website offers resources, documentation, and guides for installation and usage, emphasizing the importance of maintaining digital privacy and anonymity in an increasingly surveilled online environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experiences with consistently high CPU usage on their Chumby 8 device and details the process of upgrading its kernel as part of an ongoing series. It outlines the potential causes for the 100% CPU usage, including software inefficiencies and background processes, and shares insights into the specific changes made during the upgrade. Ultimately, the piece aims to help readers understand performance issues in similar devices and encourages exploration of kernel modifications for improved functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An old manager of mine once spent the day trying to kill a process that was running at 99% on Windows box.When I finally got round to see what he was doing I was disappointed to find he was attempting to kill the 'system idle' process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't feel like reading 4 times is necessarily a portable solution, if there will be more versions at different speeds and different I/O architectures; or how this will work under more load, and whether the original change was done to fix some other performance problem OP is not aware of, but not sure what else can be done.  Unfortunately many vendors like Marvell can seriously under-document crucial features like this.  If anything it would be good to put some of this info in the comment itself, not very elegant but how else practically are we meant to keep track of this, is the mailing list part of the documentation?Doesn't look like there's a lot of discussion on the mailing list, but I don't know if I'm reading the thread view correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the late 1990's I worked in a company that had a couple mainframes in their fleet and once I looked into a resource usage screen (Omegamon, perhaps? Is it that old?) and noticed the CPU was pegged at 100%. I asked the operator if that was normal. His answer was "Of course. We paid for that CPU, might as well use it". Funny though that mainframes are designed for that - most, if not all, non-application work is offloaded to other processors in the system so that the CPU can run applications as fast as it can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649862</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Debugging: Twenty Ourths Explained" by David A. Wheeler explores common misconceptions about debugging software. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the debugging process beyond just fixing code, highlighting that debugging often involves complex problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The text dispels twenty myths related to debugging, such as the belief that debugging can be automated, that experience is the main predictor of debugging success, and that debugging is merely the responsibility of testers. By addressing these myths, the article seeks to improve understanding of debugging's true nature and encourage better practices in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, the most pernicious temptation is to take the buggy, non-working code you have now and to try to modify it with "fixes" until the code works. In my experience, you often cannot get broken code to become working code because there are too many possible changes to make. In my view, it is much easier to break working code than it is to fix broken code.Suppose you have a complete chain of N Christmas lights and they do not work when turned on. The temptation is to go through all the lights and to substitute in a single working light until you identify the non-working light.But suppose there are multiple non-working lights? You'll never find the error with this approach. Instead, you need to start with the minimal working approach -- possibly just a single light (if your Christmas lights work that way), adding more lights until you hit an error. In fact, the best case is if you have a broken string of lights and a similar but working string of lights! Then you can easily swap a test bulb out of the broken string and into the working chain until you find all the bad bulbs in the broken string.Starting with a minimal working example is the best way to fix a bug I have found. And you will find you resist this because you believe that you are close and it is too time-consuming to start from scratch. In practice, it tends to be a real time-saver, not the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule 0: Don't panicReally, that's important. You need to think clearly, deadlines and angry customers are a distraction. That's also when having a good manager who can trust you is important, his job is to shield you from all that so that you can devote all of your attention to solving the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For #4 (divide and conquer), I've found `git bisect` helps a lot. If you have a known good commit and one of dozens or hundreds of commits after that is bad, this can help you identify the bad commit / code in a few steps.Here's a walk through on using it: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/using-git-bisect-to-help-find...I jumped into a pretty big unknown code base in a live consulting call and we found the problem pretty quickly using this method. Without that, the scope of where things could be broken was too big given the context (unfamiliar code base, multiple people working on it, only able to chat with 1 developer on the project, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682602</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the techniques used in older films to create dramatic car crashes and destruction. It highlights methods like using lightweight materials, rigged cars, and specialized props that would break or fall apart on impact. The community provides insights into specific movies and their stunts, exploring the behind-the-scenes craftsmanship that contributed to the iconic scenes. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the creative approaches filmmakers employed to ensure thrilling visual effects while maintaining safety on set.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I immediately assumed this article was about the French movie Le Corniaud (1965) in which a 2CV falls apart in 250 pieces in an accident—this scene specifically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnLj5Xo4zBc&amp;t=19s It became one of the most iconic scene of French comedy movies. To prepare the scene, the special effects engineer sawed off the car in 250 pieces, reattached every piece with hooks, and secured the hooks with "explosive bolts". At the right moment, the actor driving the car pushed a button to trigger the (tiny) explosives which made the car fall apart. Here is a French article about it: https://2cv-legende.com/expo-de-la-2cv-du-film-le-corniaud-a...PS: the French wikipedia article on the movie has a picture of the explosive bolts they used: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corniaud#L'accident_de_la_2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who don't know, Keaton was amazingly dedicated as a comedic stuntman - a silent era Jackie Chan (he was less popular after the silent era, but kept working until his death in the 60s).From Wikipedia: Garry Moore recalled, "I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you.' He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it—it hurt—but you had to care enough not to care." This would have been in about 1955, when Keaton (born 1899) was an old man and well past his heyday of really dangerous stunts (he once broke his neck during an early stunt).And he usually had an amazing commitment to film in a lot of other ways. The first time he was shot in a film he took a camera apart to figure out how it worked, because he really cared about every detail (though in the middle of his career this really hurt him, as execs wanted to just trot him up in front of the camera as a high paid celebrity - they didn't want him wasting his valuable time fussing over details, or risk their investment letting him do stunts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those reasons seem to make sense but I'd say just as much has to do with Buster Keaton himself, he had nerves of steel.During the filming of the Civil War movie The General there are images of Keaton doing things that even the bravest of stuntmen wouldn't do these days and we'd now rely on film animation and tricks to make the scenes work.For instance, Keaton—who obviously was very fit and agile—is filmed sitting on a cowcatcher of a moving locomotive whilst removing rail ties that were placed on the line to impede the train's progress and then tossing them aside.I read somewhere that Clyde Bruckman the film's director gave instructions to the cameraman "to keep filming the scene until finished or until Keaton is killed" or words to that effect.I can't remember whether Bruckman was referring to this scene or another such as when he's running across the locomotive's tender (the comment could equally have applied to many other scenes I reckon). Others who are more knowledgeable could perhaps fill in the details.I like this movie, Keaton was a
great performer and his movies are a testament to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679127</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Paul Graham discusses the concept of "wokeness," critiquing its impact on society, particularly in relation to free speech, creativity, and the startup culture. Graham argues that the rise of wokeness leads to a culture of fear and self-censorship, stifling open discourse and innovation. He highlights how this movement can be counterproductive, as it often targets individuals for their views rather than fostering genuine debate and understanding. Graham ultimately advocates for a more tolerant approach that encourages diverse perspectives and real conversations rather than conformity to ideological norms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the word “woke” means very different things to some people.As an example I think people from the American political left to somewhere(?) in the middle see it as what it has been introduced as, that being looking past the status quo and instead looking at your own values, i.e. the morality of homelessness and not having a disdain for them but empathy for them instead.and then on the other side it feels like the people on the American political right see it as what this website describes it as “ A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others.”I think the divide has originated from taking unlikeable behaviour and labeling that as ‘woke’ (in bad faith of course) and some people have just bonded to that definition so much that they see it as that.At least that’s what I’ve noticed online over the past few (bonkers) years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Imagine having to explain to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the phrase "people of color" is considered particularly enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. [...] There are no underlying principles.To understand much of our language, Gnorts would have to already be aware that our words and symbols gain meaning from how they're used, and you couldn't, for instance, determine that a swastika is offensive (in the west) by its shape alone.In this case, the term "colored people" gained racist connotations from its history of being used for discrimination and segregation - and avoiding it for that reason is the primary principle at play. There's also the secondary/less universal principle of preferring "person-first language".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to political correctness was precisely that — they were student movements. They didn't have any real power.

I don't know what Graham thinks 'political correctness' would have looked like in the 1960s – most Americans still thought women's lib was a joke, many Americans were fighting to preserve segregation, and nobody had heard of such a thing as a gay rights movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682305</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses standard patterns observed in choice-based games, focusing on how players make decisions that can affect gameplay and narrative outcome. It examines the mechanics of choice in games, highlighting the significance of player agency and the influence of design on player behavior. The author analyzes specific examples from various games to illustrate these patterns and emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics for both game design and player experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. I've been a game dev for about 30 years, much of which I've spent working with narrative design/writing teams. One thing I've learned to watch out for, especially among junior designers, is what the author labels the "Time Cave."Narrative branching, done well, is fantastic—it gives the player agency and lets them make the story their own (as it were). But when you're creating the story graph, it's easy to get lost in it and lavish care on one path at the exclusion of the others. You can easily end up with one or two long, greatly-detailed paths, and (because dev time is finine, and you need to move on to writing other parts of the game) a pile of other paths that are shorter and less interesting. If the player takes one of the shorter ones, they end up missing out on all your coolest stuff. The tools I would design for the kinds of games I created specifically made it easy to create a main story trunk with side paths (that rejoined the trunk), and more difficult to branch/loop/etc.Of course, that's not the only (or even the best) way to do narrative design—Disco Elysium is a masterwork because it did the branching, merching, loops, jumps, random checks, and so forth, so well!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always nice to share: the Grim Fandango Puzzle Document (pdf): http://gameshelf.jmac.org/2008/11/13/GrimPuzzleDoc_small.pdfPerfect example of the "Branch and Bottleneck".It even includes similar graphics at the start of each act.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fun, and holds true in the creative writing group I run. We use a website I programmed that helps us collaborate on writing branching fiction. We have a mapping utility that creates graphs like in the article, except more animated (d3.js, elkjs).As different authors can start their own new stories, one thing I often have to deal with is that they want to design their story to have both long path lengths (multiple chapters before an ending), and also high choice count. Those of you who know something about geometric series know that this causes problems. I often have to tell them they can't have everything they want, which causes minor drama. :)As a result, one of our stories basically shot its "choice budget" in the first few chapters, leading to many linear paths in the latter parts of the narratives, which is fun in its own way.Another of our stories has just started playing with the "gauntlet pattern" as the article describes. For this one, we decided that all chapters must be in the "same universe", just following different characters' perspectives, and are planning for certain "anchor chapters" where all characters come together for a meeting. Probably the detective questioning them as a group (it's a murder mystery).All of our stories are supposed to be literary, so usually in third person, sometimes first, never the second-person. So we don't tend to use choices and chapters as directions and rooms; it's all about how the plot moves. We also don't track state; they're designed to be able to be printed as books people can page through.Overall a super-fun project for me and a handful of other writers, it's been a consistent way to spend a few hours of fun each week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "root access" in the context of technology and computing, emphasizing the importance of users having control over their own devices and software. It argues for the right to root access as a fundamental aspect of digital autonomy and security, allowing users to customize and optimize their systems to meet personal needs. The piece highlights the implications of denying root access, such as increased vulnerability to security breaches and reliance on manufacturers for updates and support. Overall, it advocates for greater transparency and user empowerment in digital environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a ton of products on the market that are vastly more dangerous than computers: guns, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, chainsaws, table saws, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food. Yes, consumers do sometimes harm themselves by using these products. That's the price of freedom. I think it's bizarre that we treat computers as the most dangerous products in the world that for some reason demand paternalism, when none of these other products are locked down by the vendor.The reason that computers are locked down by the vendors is not that computers are somehow more dangerous than other things we buy. The reason is simply that it's technically possible to lock down computers, and vendors have found that it's massively, MASSIVELY profitable to do so. It's all about protecting their profits, not protecting us. We know that the crApp Store is full of scams that steal literally millions of dollars from consumers, and we know that the computer vendors violate our privacy by phoning home with "analytics" covering everything we do on the devices. This is not intended for our benefit but rather for theirs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP here. Really glad to see others engaging with this topic, I wrote up this post because I felt like there wasn't anything out there that was advocating for unlocked hardware as part of the discussion on "right to repair".As someone that works in security, I fully understand the need for sane defaults that protect the average user. I even advocate in the article that we should keep these defaults in place for the most part.What I tend to not understand is the argument that there should be no option for more enterprising users to access their hardware at the lowest levels because we need to protect the average consumer. It may be a footgun for some, but that's sort of the point. I expect to be able to modify something I own, whether it's to my detriment or not.My argument isn't that root access should be the default, but at the very least it should be an option. I just don't think it's right that we've normalized corporations blocking the ability to load / inspect software, which often is marketed as a safety or privacy thing, but is arguably more a business decision meant to protect profit margins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I detest Google, but I do think they made the right call with Android devices and Chromebooks. You can unlock either as long as you are willing to totally wipe the device first and start over as a new device under a new security context.This removes the risk of this being abused to compromise the data of stolen devices or evil maid attacks unless a user that knows what they are doing has explicitly opted themselves into that risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677835</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the wiki -- I have always been interested in hardware hacking but I have always felt overwhelmed as I didn't know where to start. I believe this kind of resource can greatly help with that, especially the case studies.However, I can't help but feel that a major part of the content is LLM-generated, or at least LLM-rewritten. It feels off and uninteresting to read, honestly. Is it the case? To support my case, I see that the case study page (https://www.hardbreak.wiki/introduction/case-study-led-to-a-...) has very similar paragraphs next to each other, the second one seemingly being the "genuine" one, and the first one being the LLM-rewritten version.I'm not against using LLMs to help fix typos or reformulate things, but you should definitely keep some of your style. The LLM that you used (if you used one) made the content super bland, and as a reader, I'm not really incentivized to browse more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately not Open Source, in the common definition of the word.From the license.md [0] page, under "Terms":&gt; Exemptions: Commercial Use: For inquiries regarding commercial use, please contact the author.[0] https://github.com/f3nter/HardBreak/blob/fd3d2d4cd17624a3f62...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shameless plug: For anybody wanting to get into rockchip SoC development I've created a (no AI) resource: https://danielc.dev/rk/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672821</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the computer game "Railroad Tycoon II," discussing its release, gameplay mechanics, and the impact it had on the simulation genre. It highlights the game's emphasis on strategy and economic management, allowing players to build and operate their own railroad empire. The piece also reflects on its innovative features, such as improved graphics and artificial intelligence, while considering the legacy it left in gaming history. Overall, the article captures the essence of the game and its significance within the realm of simulation titles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I played the Linux version the article mentions while at Goldman Sachs; a colleague on the Red Hat coverage team gave me a boxed copy of Corel Linux including the game. The port ran very well on my Red Hat Linux box at home.In retrospect it was part of a brief flurry of Linux ports of major games. I also got to play Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Neverwinter Nights; in both cases the publishers made Linux clients available for download that use the retail version's assets. Despite the valiant efforts of Wine and related projects, the world would have to wait 15 more years before Proton leveraged Wine technology to bring quasi-native games to Linux, and 20 years before Steam Deck made it the norm or close to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In this reviewer’s opinion, it was a sparkling creative success as well as a commercial one, making it all the more deserving of remembrance. We’ve seen a fair number of train games built on similar premises in the years since 1998, but I don’t know that we’ve ever seen a comprehensively better one.RRT2 is my all time favorite game, and has yet to find a spiritual successor in my heart. Alongside Anno 1602, it may be the oldest PC game I regularly open up and play for fun.The gameplay is still so good. The fact that the game is so open-ended and also so cutthroat, combined with the procedurally generated maps means it always feels fresh to play, even all these years later. The UI has aged but has not gotten in the way.And yes, as reviewer describes, it absolutely nails the theme. The sound design, the visuals, the music, the historical setting. Things feel gritty and real and tough. Just like the game's treatment of Robber Barons, the game perfectly balances romanticism with cynicism. The game made me love trains.I still remember learning as a child how stock trading on the margin worked when I simultaneously made and then lost a massive fortune attempting to buy out a rival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still keep this on my box and crack it open now and again.   I also pulled the music out of the distro and put it into my listening rotation while working.   You have to add your own hawk screech sounds though :-)I’m a total sucker for network optimization train games though.   Love the crayon rails games which I wrote about here:https://dave.org/posts/20221206_trains/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657585</guid></item><item><title>9.

The movie is split into roughly 1min sections, with each one done by a different creator. The quality is all over the place, in a hilarious way. One minute it's produced by a professional animator nailing the scenes, then the next minute it's people goofing around in their backyard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I drew a few frames in this, but it was a real shame to see how little quality control there was in the final cut. Makes it kind of unwatchable.Progress near the end was really fast, as lots of people had caught on and were racing to get as many frames in as possible.I really don't think this concept has been worn out yet, and someone could make their own version of this with a small review step and then we'd get some fun, actually watchable hand-drawn movies :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Artists in Europe have already been fighting to protect the copyright of Tintin to keep the artwork away from large language models (LLMs) training various AI algorithms.There is no copyright in the character anymore, so there’s nothing to protect.I really do not understand this perspective.  Do people also wish to use legal force to prevent others from working with, for example, Gainsborough, or Moliere, or Julius Caesar, or Homer?  Come on: at some point something has to enter the public domain and become part of the shared treasure of all mankind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to a Hacker News comment, my kids, ages 7-13. Have been watching an episode of Tintin from the internet archive every week, and they love it. Link: https://archive.org/details/tintinseries43&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post about Tintin, one of my top childhood influences. I have a new edition of all the albums (much better than mine) unopened and ready for when my kid grows enough. The TV show wasn't so good IMHO - of course the narrative was great because it came from the comics, but animation quality was just so-so, or at least that's how I remember it.If you liked Tintin and long for more comics of the same kind, I recommend you to try Blake and Mortimer. They're different (e.g. with a more serious and wordy style, hardly any comical gags, but also with more fantastic elements). But they are the closest I know, and in some aspects even better (I personally prefer them although I'm aware it's due to very subjective factors, most people would still rank Tintin higher overall and Blake and Mortimer don't have such a universal acclaim).The only thing I dislike about the post is the gratuitous rant on AI at the end. It is great news that Tintin joins the public domain. Especially great because it's one of these cases where the owners have been especially abusive, chasing fan efforts done as a labor of love, lest they harm their sales of overpriced merchandising.Why exactly should be worry about people generating AI images of Tintin? What is the harm done? We know what the original albums are, they will probably be preserved as long as there is human civilization (despite copyright, not thanks to it), and we can freely decide if we also want to read/watch/see derivative works (and which) or not. I just don't see the problem at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651043</guid></item><item><title>11. Entropy of a Large Language Model output</title><link>https://nikkin.dev/blog/llm-entropy.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of entropy in large language models (LLMs) and how it relates to the predictability of generated text. It explains that understanding entropy can help improve the performance and effectiveness of LLMs, highlighting the balance between randomness and coherence in text generation. Furthermore, the blog post explores the implications of entropy on model training and evaluation, offering insights into how adjusting entropy can influence the quality of output and the potential for innovative applications in natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are observing "flattened logits" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774#page=12&amp;org=openai .The entropy of ChatGPT (as well as all other generative models which have been 'tuned' using RLHF, instruction-tuning, DPO, etc) is so low because it is not predicting "most likely tokens" or doing compression. A LLM like ChatGPT has been turned into an RL agent which seeks to maximize reward by taking the optimal action. It is, ultimately, predicting what will manipulate the imaginary human rater into giving it a high reward.So the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text). This reduction in entropy is a standard RL effect as agents switch from exploration to exploitation: there is no benefit to taking anything less than the single best action, so you don't want to risk taking any others.This is also why completions are so boring and Boltzmann temperature stops mattering and more complex sampling strategies like best-of-N don't work so well: the greedy logit-maximizing removes information about interesting alternative strategies, so you wind up with massive redundancy and your net 'likelihood' also no longer tells you anything about the likelihood.And note that because there is now so much LLM text on the Internet, this feeds back into future LLMs too, which will have flattened logits simply because it is now quite likely that they are predicting outputs from LLMs which had flattened logits. (Plus, of course, data labelers like Scale can fail at quality control and their labelers cheat and just dump in ChatGPT answers to make money.) So you'll observe future 'base' models which have more flattened logits too...I've wondered if to recover true base model capabilities and get logits that actually meaningful predict or encode 'dark knowledge', rather than optimize for a lowest-common-denominator rater reward, you'll have to start dumping in random Internet text samples to get the model 'out of assistant mode'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In LM research, it is more common to measure the exponentiation of the entropy, called perplexity. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting aspect of this behaviour used in the byte latent transformer model.Encoding tokens from source text can be done a number of ways, byte pair encoding, dictionaries etc.You can also just encode text into tokens (or directly into embeddings) with yet another model.The problem arises that if you are doing variable length tokens, how many characters do you put into any particular token, and then because that token must represent the text if you use it for decoding, where do you store count of characters stored in any particular token.The byte latent transformer model solves this by using the entropy for the next character.   A small character model receives the history character by character and predicts the next one.  If the entropy spikes from low to high they count that as a token boundary.   Decoding the same characters from the latent one at a time produces the same sequence and deterministically spikes at the same point in the decoding indicating that it is at the end of the token without the length being required to be explicitly encoded.(disclaimer: My layman's view of it anyway,  I may be completely wrong)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649315</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent outage of Canva and explores themes of system saturation and resilience in digital platforms. It analyzes how high demand can lead to vulnerabilities in online services, highlighting the consequences of such outages for users and businesses reliant on these tools. The author emphasizes the importance of building resilient systems that can withstand unexpected spikes in usage while reflecting on the broader implications for the tech industry and the necessity for better preparedness in the face of similar disruptions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had a similar CDN problem with releasing major Warframe updates: our CDN partner would inadvertently DDoS our origin servers when we launched an update because thousands of cold edges would call home simultaneously when all players players relogged at the same time.One CDN vendor didn't even offer a tiered distribution system so every edge called home at the same time, another vendor did have a tiered distribution system designed to avoid this problem but it was overwhelmed by the absurd number of files we'd serve multiplied by the large user count and so we'd still end up with too much traffic hitting the origin.The interesting thing was that no vendor we evaluated offered a robust preheating solution if they offered one at all. One vendor even went so far as to say that they wouldn't allow it because it would let customers unfairly dominate the shared storage cache at the edge (which sort of felt like airlines overbooking seats on a flight to me).These days we run an army of VMs that fetch all assets from every point of presence we can cover right before launching an update.Another thing we've had to deal with mentioned in the article is overloading back-end nodes; our solution is somewhat ham-fisted but works quite well for us: we cap the connection counts to the back end and return 503s when we saturate. The trick, however, is getting your load-balancer to leave the client connection open when this happens -- by default multiple LBs we've used would slam the connection closed so that when you're serving up 50K 503s a second the firewall would buckle under the runaway connection pool lingering in TIME_WAIT. Good times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This problem is similar to what electric utilities call "load takeup". After a power outage, when power is turned back on, there are many loads that draw more power at startup.The shortest term effects are power supplies recharging their capacitors and incandescent bulbs warming up. That's over within a second.Then it's the motors, which have 2x-3x their running load when starting as they bring their rotating mass up to speed. That extra load lasts for tens of seconds.If power has been off for more than a few minutes, everything in heating and cooling which normally cycles on and off will want to start. That high load lasts for minutes.Bringing up a power grid is thus done by sections, not all at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole incident report is interesting, but I feel like the most important part of the solution is buried here [0]:* "We're adding timeouts to prevent user requests from waiting excessively long to retrieve assets."When you get to the size of Canva, you can't forget your AbortController and exponential backoff on your Fetch API calls.--0: https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/canva-incident-report...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676529</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe that most of the papers presented here focus on acquiring knowledge rather than deep understanding. If you’re completely unfamiliar with the subject, I recommend starting with textbooks rather than papers. The latest Bishop’s "Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts (2024)" [1] is an excellent resource that covers the "basics" of deep learning and is quite updated. Another good option is Chip Huyen’s "AI Engineering (2024)" [2]. Another excellent choice will be "Dive into Deep Learning" [3], Understanding Deep Learning [4], or just read anything from fast.ai and watch Karpathy's lectures on YouTube.[1]: https://www.bishopbook.com

Just get a feel for how these LLMs respond then build a pretty and user friendly app on top of them. Knowing the difference between "multi head attention" and "single head attention" isn't very useful if you're just using OpenAI or Groq's API.Am I missing something here? I'd love to know where I'm wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hi! author here! putting together a list like this is intimidating - for every thing i pick there are a dozen other suitable candidates so please view this as a curriculum with broadly prescriptive weightings, with the understanding that the CURRENTLY_RELEVANT_PAPER is always a moving pointer rather than fixed reference.we went thru this specific reading list in our paper club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIMY9pLPdgif you are interested in a narrative version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42686457</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please stop putting salespeople in charge of highly technical product companies like Sonos. I'm so glad that Tom Conrad is an engineer by training. I hope he can turn this mess around.The key technical change that broke Sonos was abandoning their reliable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) system for device discovery in favor of mDNS, while also shifting from direct device communication to a cloud-based API approach. This new architecture made all network traffic encrypted and routed through Sonos cloud servers (even for local operations), adding significant overhead and latency, especially for older Sonos devices with limited processing power. They also switched from native platform-specific UX frameworks to a JavaScript-based interface while moving music service interactions through their cloud instead of direct SMAPI calls, resulting in slower performance and reduced functionality.For a more extended discussion, see this excellent LinkedIn post from Andy Pennell, a principal engineer at Microsoft with a deep technical understanding of Sonos systems. He created one of the most successful third-party Sonos apps for Windows Phone and worked directly with Sonos on their official Windows Phone 8 app.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-happened-sonos-app-techn...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's less the app, more the business decision to tell people who had spent thousands and thousands of dollars on elaborate sound systems to go throw it all in the trash and start over, all at once.Even Apple has never been that bad. They drop support for things over time but even their roughest transitions (x86, Apple Silicon) have come with extensive day 1 support for previous functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did they switch apps again, or is this still about the debacle when they switched from their original app to the second gen (S2) app many many years ago?Because while that was a shitshow, that's ancient history by now. Did they screw up another generational switch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687932</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone fill in the missing link in my understanding here? It seems like the post never gets around to explaining why waiting for 14272 years should make the river passable. (Nor why this river in particular, as opposed to any other obstacle.)The post alludes to a quirk that causes people not to get sicker while waiting; but it says they still get hungry, right? So you can't wait 14272 years there for any purpose unless you have 14272 years' worth of food, right?IIUC, the blogger goes on to patch the game so that you don't get hungry either. But if patching the game is fair play, then what's the point of mentioning the original no-worsening-sickness quirk?It kinda feels like asking "Can you win Oregon Trail by having Gandalf's eagles fly you to Willamette?" and then patching the game so the answer is "yes." Like, what's the reason I should care about that particular initial question? care so badly that I'd accept cheating as an interesting answer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mental image conjured up by this scenario is amusing.  Your impossibly patient party waits almost 15,000 years to cross a river in a state of suspended animation.  Then they finally cross the river and instantly wither away to dust because they had not had a good meal in 15 centuries.Something that was very common with BASIC interpreters but still baffling is how they were running on machines with extremely limited memory and fairly limited CPU time, but for some reason decided not to make integer types available to programmers.  Every number you stored was a massive floating point thing that ate memory like crazy and took forever for the wimpy 8 bit CPU with no FPU to do any work on.  It's like they were going out of their way to make BASIC as slow as possible.  It probably would have been faster and more memory efficient if all numbers were BCD strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You board the Generation Ship Oregon Trail with some trepidation. If the scientists are correct you will be in suspended animation for the next 14272 years. You already feel colder somehow. To the West you see a robotic barkeep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682813</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the practice of mudlarking along the River Thames in London, highlighting the discovery of garnets and other historical artifacts by individuals searching through the muddy banks. It delves into the rich history of the river as a site for finding lost treasures, elaborating on the thrill and context of these findings. The piece also discusses the evolution of mudlarking, the significance of the artifacts in understanding London’s past, and the personal stories of those who engage in this unique hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Only a few people are legally allowed to hunt for Thames garnets—or even remove them if they find them by chance. Mudlarks are among the few who are legally permitted to remove items from the riverbanks. To be a mudlark, you need a license, and in recent years, the British government suspended the issuing of new licenses for several years following a boom in applications during the pandemic lockdowns, leaving the already tight-knit mudlark community in a holding pattern.Well, that's something new I learned today. I wonder why they have to be licensed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my mind, "gems" is pronounced "games", just to mess with foreigners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not these gems but my son and I hunted for and found a couple of 19th century single use pipes and part of a brick with a cool logo a couple of years ago. Go to the Tower Bridge, there are stairs to go to the shore right next to it. Good hunting!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684257</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of suspending and resuming FreeBSD systems, detailing the underlying mechanisms and configuration steps required to effectively use these features. It outlines different methods for suspending a system, including device control commands, and emphasizes the importance of ensuring proper handling of system processes and services during these operations. The author provides practical tips and commands to help users effectively implement suspend/resume functionality while avoiding common pitfalls. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for FreeBSD users looking to manage power states efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP S3 sleep... Took years to get it to work reliably under Linux, then we had a good decade+ run of it "just working" like this, now back to trying to weed out all the wacky platform quirks and weird hardware/firmware behavior that make the S0ix states be just barely unusable.Maybe in another five years...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows used to work about this well back in the XP days, possibly Windows 7 as well. Plenty of times I hit the "sleep" button that Logitech put right next to the esc key (....) and resumed the system to find everything working as expected.Not sure if the embedded video is suspend to RAM or disk. Also not sure why there wasn't a PW prompt upon resume, but I'm not a BSD person, just someone who is paranoid about PW prompts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD and Suspend/Resume… About 10 years ago, I switched from FreeBSD to Linux because I couldn't get suspend/resume to work reliably (i.e. suspend/resume cycle succeeds and it doesn't drain my laptop battery in between) on FreeBSD on my Thinkpad.
And this was only Suspend to RAM. Suspend to Disk is really nice to have, especially if coupled with hybrid standby, as on macOS and Windows by default.I really appreciate that people still maintain FreeBSD on the desktop, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662552</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques Northeastern University's recent redesign of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences curriculum, arguing that it moves away from essential computer science fundamentals. The author expresses concern that the new curriculum prioritizes trendy topics over core principles, potentially undermining students' foundational knowledge and problem-solving skills critical for the field. The piece emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between innovative content and traditional computer science education to ensure that graduates are well-equipped for future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655283"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I went to Caltech when they were contemplating similar things in the CS curriculum, although the normal curriculum was less radical than Northeastern's seems to be.There is a tension here that is being understated which is that people of every major now take the intro-level CS class because programming is integral to everything. Teaching algorithm design in that class is not particularly useful to a biologist who just wants to be able to cobble something together to analyze some data (usually in Python). As a result, the non-computer-scientists and non-software-engineers at the school would rather have a curriculum that is more "practical" and directly applies to research (or later class projects) the students might be doing.Some time not far in the future, we are going to accept that this is not the same thing at all as computer science and give the computer scientists a curriculum that is a lot heavier on math and theory while adding elective or core courses for non-major students on programming. That will end the compromised state that intro CS courses currently sit in. Right now, there isn't enough teaching talent to run those non-core courses (because that talent is earning the big bucks doing something else).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The end of an era. This is nothing less than a travesty honestly. The current (now former) curriculum at NEU was uniquely exceptional, and now it will be conformingly adequate. Anyone who complained about the difficulty or lack of "job-market applicability" of the  Fundies classes entirely missed the forest for the trees. The point is the design _process_, and using Racket forced this. It also demonstrated the magic that is possible with computer science. The Dr. Racket editor has features that do not exist in any other editor (e.g. visually tracing references, and so much more). The teaching language just got out of the way and let professors teach the essentials of program design, without the burden of language idiosyncrasies. My mind was honestly blown when Olin Shivers coded the Y combinator directly and showed us how to add recursion to a language. It felt like having occult knowledge, and it made me an acolyte to computer science. I mourn the loss of this curriculum for future students, especially considering the premium price tag they now pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The University that hosted "The Little Schemer" and all its derivatives. Those books were a delight and taught me to think about programming in a way that other languages had not. (Even if I didn't go to that University). 
https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/teaching.htmlI had been to a Scheme conference in Washington, adjunct to the Clojure Conference one year, and it was attended by many undergraduates from Northeastern, (and the authors of those books that I got a photo with.)I have to feel sympathy for those undergraduates I spoke to. They gave a strong feeling, even then (8 years ago), that it was time for the University to move on in language choice.I had a similar experience in the late 90s when the world was picking up Java, and our University insisted on teaching in Eiffel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655283</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the misconception that the internet has fundamentally changed human nature for the worse, arguing instead that negative behaviors were already inherent in society before the rise of online connectivity. It reflects on the nostalgia for a more amicable digital environment of the early 2000s while contending that this yearning overlooks the complexities of human interaction and the ways in which online platforms have amplified pre-existing social dynamics. The piece emphasizes the importance of recognizing that both positive and negative aspects of human behavior have always existed, irrespective of the technology used for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rose-tinted glasses are definitely a thing, as is nostalgia, and before I get into topics like the fact that UI/UX was actually scientifically better[0] back then, I'd like to take a moment to step back and consider what the author is actually implying.Yes, the world was centralised, and profit motives did exist. There was a time where it looked like AOL would legitimately kill the open web, and MSN was trying too at the same time. However; the early 00's were blessed with technological limitation.I distinctly remember the fact that IRC and the primitive forum systems we designed such that an identity tied to a real person was not something people felt the need to have.  To even care what a community thinks because ultimately there's quite literally another one just around the corner.The golden era of community creation was 2002-2004 (incidentally this is when my own IRC network formed). Because heavy handed moderation, power trips and so-on caused market pressures on moderation staff.Too heavy handed and authoritarian: you might kill your community.Not willing to stamp out toxic elements: you might kill your community.That's why we're nostalgic, because simpler times was a combination of:* more focused, human and often better moderation;* a deluge of communities where you could find a place; even if you were weird, like me - and;* an understanding that your identity was not important. "On the internet, nobody know's you're a dog".Yes, there were companies and profit seeking, the web itself was mired in proprietary plugins and jank standards. But there was an ease of hosting communities that is totally lost now.The best many of us can hope for these days, is a little carved out niche as a serf in a fiefdom.[0]: https://ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/course-notes/Micro...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there. I helped build it.It was better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do miss it though.20 years ago you could run your email domain on a machine in your basement and it would work.  You could send out email and it would be received, and the incoming spam volume was manageable.20 years ago, a buddy used an account on my net-connected Linux machine to scrape map tiles off Google Maps.  Google put a stop to it, and Gmaps wouldn't work any more on my (static) IP address.  I told him "you broke it, you fix it" and he got on the horn with someone at Google and got it unblocked.20 years ago, you could go on an online dating site and have a serious hope of finding a real mate for life. I did.  Several others I know did.20 years ago, you could go on Facebook, and see what your friends were up to.Sure, many things didn't exist back then.  But it was a more innocent world.  The internet was still an optimistic place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673596</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges facing WordPress as a content management system, highlighting issues such as security vulnerabilities, competition from other platforms, and the need for modernization. It emphasizes the declining user base and potential stagnation if the platform fails to adapt to user demands and technological advancements.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really think Matt is suffering from some sort of a mental breakdown. It’s a sad situation and there’s a lot to learn about open source projects with a huge user base and where the bottle necks exist. But I think people who know or are close to him should seriously consider an intervention. I can’t believe after two decades he’d just decide to throw it all out in a blazing fire and tarnish his reputation (and Wordpress) because of some valuation drop or being short on money. I think the dude needs help, and people close to him should try and talk sense into him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy how hosting wordpress, between 2003-2024, your main concern was Chinese/Russian hackers. And in 2025 you main concern should be if Mullenweg will hijack your website for his pissing match.Also he didn't shut down the sustainability team because he "didn't know about it". He shut it down because their stated goals are a threat to Mullenwegs dictatorship hold over wordpress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.This move by Matt to pull out of development all but guarantees a fork. The biggest argument against was the work that Automattic was putting into WordPress would be very hard to replicate in a new project. But if the community is going to be expected to do ~all of the work anyway, there's no reason to do that work inside Matt's personal fiefdom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687121</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this rather odd:&gt; “We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.”If your goal is to extract every possible cent from your existing customers, why would you also switch them from net 30 to requiring partial prepayment?  VMware wants money in general but should not have a cash flow problem, and forcing a monster early payment seems like it will force customers to notice an immediate problem and make a choice instead of allowing themselves to be slowly and steadily ripped off.If I were a pointy-haired CEO committed to the multiply-pricing-by-five strategy, I would do my best to sweeten the deal: offer generous payment terms, give nice-sounding discounts for up front commitments, give very large discounts for nodes that haven’t yet been leased to a customer, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely don't want to miniminize the significance of this.  This is huge!But, they did have some major benefits that most companies looking to do the same won't:&gt; Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform.&gt; The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes.Again, still a great accomplishment and an exciting milestone for them, but for people still stuck on VMWare that are looking to migrate, it's good to know about the above things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phrase "homebrew KVM platform" made me chuckle. All of the hyperscalers have a homebrew, aka proprietary platform using a hypervisor.  AWS has Nitro which seems to have been based on KVM but likely quite different by now.If you are selling VMs to customers, I can't understand a good reason to use VMWare.  The only reason would be if you are selling VMWare as a service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682671</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;User defined functions were implemented similarly as external execs in early shells. As the script was parsed, functions were dropped into /tmp without their wrappings and then called as external programs.  Since they would still reference parameters as $1, $2 etc, it just worked: function bodies and standalone sh scripts had the same interface! Such a clever idea to avoid managing an interpreted call stack in the parent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked C source file is an excellent example of ancient C, when it was still more closer to high level assembly:https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V2/cmd/glob.c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; PS: I don't know why expanding shell wildcards used a separate program in V6 and earlier, but part of it may have been to keep the shell smaller and more minimal so that it required less memory.See, I thought it was a nice separation of concerns and wondered why we lost such a nice approach, until I read:&gt; How escaping wildcards works in the V5 and V6 shell is that all characters in commands and arguments are restricted to being seven-bit ASCII. The shell and /etc/glob both use the 8th bit to mark quoted characters, which means that such quoted characters don't match their unquoted versions and won't be seen as wildcards by either the shellat which point I suddenly became a fan of ditching it. I do wonder if there's not some better way to factor that functionality out...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680437</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been my experience. Foundation models have completely changed the game of ML. Previously, companies might have needed to hire ML engineers familiar with ML training, architectures etc to get mediocre results. Now companies can just hire a regular software engineer familiar with foundation model API’s to get excellent results. In some ways it is sad, but in other ways the result you get is so much better than we achieved before.My example was an image segmentation model. I managed to create an dataset of 100,000+ images and was training UNets and other advanced models on it, always reached a good validation loss but my data was simply not diverse enough and I faced a lot of issues in actual deployment, where the data distribution kept changing on a day to day basis. Then, I tried DINO v2 from Meta, finetuned on 4 images and it solved the problem, handled all the variations in lighting etc with far higher accuracy than I ever achieved. It makes sense, DINO was train on 100M + images, I would never be able to compete with that.In this case, the company still needed my expertise, because Meta just released the weights and so someone had to setup the fine-tuning pipeline. But I can imagine a fine tuning API like OpenAI’s requiring no expertise outside of simple coding. If AI results depend on scale, it naturally follows that only a few well funded companies, will build AI that actually works, and everyone else will just use their models. The only way this trend reverses, is if compute becomes so cheap and ubiquitous, that everyone can achieve the necessary scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's tough to judge without seeing examples of the targets and the user photos, but I'm curious if this could be done with just old-school SIFT. If it really is exactly the same image in the in the corpus and on the wall, does a neural embedding model really buy you a lot? A small number of high confidence tie points  seems like it'd be all you need, but it probably depends a lot on just how challenging the user photos are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This tracks with my experience.
We built a complex processing pipeline for an NLP classification, search and comprehension task. Using vector database of Proprietary data etc.We ran a benchmark of our system against an LLM call and the LLM performed much better for so much cheaper, in terms of dev time, complexity, and compute.
Incredible time to be in working in the space seeing traditional problems eaten away by new paradigms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660184</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the rise of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the American food industry, tracing its origins back to the 1970s when it became a cheaper alternative to sugar due to government corn subsidies. It explores the health implications of HFCS consumption, its role in the obesity epidemic, and how food manufacturers adopted it widely because of its sweetness and preservative qualities. The piece also highlights the backlash against HFCS and the growing demand for natural sugars, reflecting on the complexities of food production and consumer choices in America.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corn Syrup and Sucrose are chemically identical from the standpoint of human metabolism, especially in solution where sucrose will have already disassociated. The only difference is that the ratio of fructose:sucrose is slightly (~5%) higher in corn syrup.I've always been dismayed at the misdirected fury around corn syrup as if it is somehow worse than any other sugar.If you want to go down the rabbit hole, try to find an actual proper double blind academic study that demonstrates a taste difference between sucrose and high fructose corn syrup. I'll be here waiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently watched an interesting video on the subject of corn syrup. Which led me into the fascinating rabbit hole of sugar chemistry.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY66qpMFOYoIf I might summarize.Your body can absorb three types of sugar into the blood, glucose, fructose and galactose. glucose is directly used by cells, the other two have to take a trip through the liver to turn them into glucose.Table sugar is sucrose. a complex sugar. which can be best thought of as a fructose and a glucose linked together.Corn syrup is a mixture of ~ 45% glucose 55% fructoseSucrose is quickly broken apart into glucose and fructose in several environments, high heat will do it, but also acidic environments. like your stomach, or a soda. a soda will be slightly acidic due to the carbon dioxide dissolved in it(carbonic acid). And some formulations(like coke) add additional phosphoric acid.And to spoil the video. Even if you put sucrose into a soda, that is not what you are going to be drinking. I was unable to figure out why it tastes different, are the ratios off? additional trace chemicals in one source?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Americans are paying their food higher than they should because industrials are paying more for sugar because lobbyist paid money to politicians to get them to put tariff on sugar import.So, basically American's money is going in the pocket of big corporation thanks to corrupt politicians.And it's still going on to these days, no government has yet removed these tariffs.Isn't tariff what started the American revolution ? Things changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687133</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wonder why conversation graphs look this way in Disco Elysium is because it's build using middleware called Articy:draft. Graphs is how Articy editor designed so it's only natural to visalize it this way.Since my team also made a story driven game using Articy that far less complex than Disco Elysium, but still complex. After we done it I can say for sure that whoever written Disco Elysium is trully insane, in a good way. While Articy is a good tool it's have own set of problems specifically awful performance on huge projects and I can't even imagine how developers of Disco Elysium managed to accompish it.So I pretty sure Disco Elysium isn't just masterpiece of storytelling and writing, but also insane technical achievement of whoever managed to get it all working together using tools they had. Even on a project of much smaller scale getting it all debugged, loop-free and free of tons of logical errors is very hard. Knowing how much variables Disco Elysium have I truly believe developers are all geniuses.PS: It's just everyone always wonder at how cool and complex modern rendering is or performance in game with millions of objects, but very few people understand how hard is to create story-driven game if there is more than 10 variables and not just int skill checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is something more supposed to show up?

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive map of the London Underground system, showcasing various tube lines, stations, and key transit information. Users can explore different tube routes, view station details, and access real-time updates on train services. The site aims to facilitate navigation through London's extensive underground network, making it easier for commuters and tourists to plan their journeys efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, it doesn't even mention the map. Instead, it invokes trademark registration numbers but these resolve [2] to LONDON UNDERGROUND and UNDERGROUND wordmarks and the roundel, none of them covering the map geometry as far as I can tell. It alleges a violation under Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act [3] but the act only applies to domains - and TfL never claims "traintimes" to be an infringing domain name (certainly doesn't look so under the marks cited). And, as a sibling comment points out, the act is a U.S. law but the site appears to be hosted in the U.K.If you think you have a case about the map, why not state it explicitly? The cynical answer is that ISPs have incentives not to care so making a case doesn't matter but ...[1] https://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/email2.txt

[3] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t see the issue. You were using the TfL schematic map which is very much a form of art. I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they asked you to take that specific map down or continue with a license.To remove the whole site because of that seems petty.It was clearly stated in their api documentation. It’s no
different than getting a license or usage rights for hosting an image or video on your site. Just because you are a hobbyist doesn’t mean you don’t have to follow the rules.This is coming from someone who is extremely pro fair-use and right to ownership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This licensing page appears to be a new addition to TfL, which probably suggests some bureaucrat negotiated a deal with a creative agency to license the tube map for pennies on the dollar, resulting in them sending out these notices.https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/business-and-advertisers/map-lic...Amusingly the notice was sent with references to USA trademark law.I am not sure how it works with regional governments, but copyright information for government-produced works tends to live as a "crown copyright" in the UK and former colonies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682876</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the harrowing experience of a luxury passenger train that became trapped for three days during a deadly winter storm near Donner Pass in 1952. The train, named the "City of San Francisco," was stuck in deep snow, leaving passengers stranded without sufficient supplies or heat. The piece details the efforts of the train crew and rescuers to keep everyone safe and fed while highlighting the brutal conditions they faced. Ultimately, the story illustrates both the challenges of winter travel in the Sierra Nevada and the resilience of the stranded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “In the 1950s, you had this mid-century hubris—technology could conquer all,” says Ty Smith, director of the California State Railroad Museum. “Part of the reason this episode happened was this unyielding optimism that we could solve every problem. In the face of a blizzard in the Sierra, that just wasn’t true.”My takeaway was the opposite. A hundred years before this, a different group was stuck in the same pass, and couldn't get help for 4 months. This situation resolved in 3 days, and there was no cannibalism. When something similar happened to an Amtrak in 2019, it only took a day and a half, and people still had access to Twitter the entire time. Not to diminish the suffering, etc., etc., but it seems like there's cause for optimism when it comes to technological progress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The City was among America’s premier trains, a luxury streamliner that could hit 110 miles per hour while white-jacketed waiters balanced trays of cocktailsI wonder how passengers back then would have imagined rail travel today, 75 years later (aside from the life-threatening storms, of course). The Overland Route is now freight-only, and the closest equivalent, the California Zephyr, takes about 52 hours to make the journey this train did in just 40!More on topic, I was surprised to read:&gt; When the steam generators’ water tanks ran dry, heat disappeared, too.Weren't there surrounded by frozen water? Is there any reason snow couldn't be used in an emergency to heat the train?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I've driven Route 50 between Tahoe and Placerville a few times. Many of these times the weather has been quite bad. Many of these times I've had to wait for hours while an accident was cleared, or 12 foot snow drifts were plowed.When I'm traveling in mountain snow, I'm always very neurotic about prep. AWD or 4x4, water, chains, food, emergency kits, etc ... I always assume I could be stuck for 24 hours or more.In the meantime, I am constantly shocked by how many people make this trek with little or no respect for how deadly snow can be. The worst of it is when it puts others in danger: I'll never forget seeing a front-wheel drive sedan repeatedly driving up, then slipping back on a steep hill, while a line of 20 cars waited behind it.Part of it is just not knowing (I grew up in the east coast), but part of it is just human nature to not understand some things to be inherently dangerous. Snow and cold looks so serene, but cold in it's various forms has killed many more people than heat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657593</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper basically reinforces one of the tenets of transit noise and vibration analyses: if you don't maintain your system (specifically wheels and rails in the case of noise), things tend to get louder over time. BCRTC knows this [0] and they're working on it. As with all things, it's about time and money, but they are trying to be proactive with vehicle and track maintenance via rail grinding and complaint tracking.[0] https://archive.wheel-rail-seminars.com/archives/2022/rt-pap...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rail grinding noise of those Mark 1 Skytrain cars are really something. They literally made my ears hurt. For reference New York's subway rail noise never made my ears hurt that much.The explanation I read online is that Translink (the transport authority) lost one of the 2 rail grinders they contracted, and had to buy a grinder for use. So for a few years, while waiting for the grinder to arrive, the rails were not getting the regular grinding needed that'd lessen the wheels-on-rail noise.An unverified rumor I heard was that Translink cheaped out and bought a batch of substandard rails that are softer than needed. This means the rails wear out and become out of spec faster. The issue was compounded by the fact that the softer rails were used to replace a large portions of routes with sharp curves.The rolling stocks use linear induction propulsion, which means there is no electric motor on the train. The trains are very light as a result and require different maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And then you have Montreal with their very quiet rubber wheeled metro system. https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-techn...The problem with the Vancouver system is the combination of it being above ground and noisy. Ideally, you want to build density directly beside the tracks. That said, I lived near the tracks for a few years and although we could hear it, it wasn't that bad. We were fairly high up and had good windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681762</guid></item><item><title>31.

It explores the reasons developers might be drawn to these languages, such as their simplicity, unique features, or niche applications. The author reflects on the benefits and drawbacks of using little languages in software development, emphasizing the importance of understanding the trade-offs involved. Ultimately, the piece encourages developers to appreciate the diversity of programming languages while critically assessing their practicality for real-world uses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My take is that, for productive work, language is much less important than everything around it. I need at the very least some kind of package management and dependency resolution system. Sometimes I want to read a CSV file, turn some of the content into JSON and serve it over HTTP. In an environment with sensible libraries, that's just a case of glueing stuff together. The problem is not little languages, it's little ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author seems to miss that many people don't write their lisp (or their game, or their code-golfing one-liner, or their befunge program) for it to be used, they write it because they enjoy writing a lisp.As for those who believe their language of choice can actually become mainstream, it's a long, soul-crushing and miserable road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The problem seems to be languages with a small, well written specification.that’s why I’m making my language as big and poorly specified as possible:https://hyperscript.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42655544</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "comptime" or compile time as a form of configuration in programming. It explores how using compile-time techniques can lead to more efficient and safer code by allowing certain operations and configurations to be determined before runtime. The author presents examples highlighting the benefits of comptime, such as improved performance and compile-time error detection, as well as its applications in various programming languages. The piece encourages developers to consider comptime as a valuable tool for enhancing their code's configurability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun story, while at FAANG I was once tasked with making a parameter configurable via flag. This wasn't super easy for various reasons, but I pointed out that it was configurable already: all you had to do was submit a PR to change the hardcoded value in the code and it would update everywhere and that wasn't much different from how we already configured runtime parameters by submitting a PR that updated the config file.I got a good chuckle out of my coworkers but as I've gotten more experienced there's a grain of truth in that. Actually the main non-joking objection was that deployments are slow so if we needed to, reconfiguring runtime flags was a good amount faster. But that made me think: if deployments and builds are super fast, would we still need configuration in the conventional yaml and friends sense? It could save a lot of foot guns from misconfiguration and practically speaking, we essentially never restarted the server to reconfigure it. From the article,&gt; Unless you have really good reason to, you probably should not do this for normal options - it makes your library much more rigid by requiring that the user of your library know the options at comptime.I dunno, actually that sounds really great to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652730</guid></item><item><title>35.

Some comments:1) May want to auto-magically handle input for things like apostrophes. E.g. "O'Hare"... It looks like somewhere in the process this data was not preserved/saved/sent, but people will probably try to search with it. Might also want to handle the accent marks and what not too2) The terms &amp; conditions for Step 3, the checkbox at the bottom doesn't have enough contrast when checked. I do not have a disability, and I still found it very faint. Someone with a disability would likely have a lot of trouble (not to mention, it requires scrolling to the bottom to check it in the first place, which isn't awesome for accessibility)3) I appreciate the warning on the terms and conditions about seeing things you might not want to see. A good reminder for those that might not want to tarnish a memory of someone... Reminds me of the DNA tests for Christmas, or learning about Punnett Squares and genetics, sometimes you might not want to go looking :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I previously tried getting military records for my deceased grandfather. From what I can recall, it was complicated by the fact that I wasn't "next of kin", which would limit the data I'd have access to. Even my parent, who was next of kin, would have needed additional paperwork as proof, e.g. a death/marriage certificate for my grandmother.On one hand, if this works then I'll be happy to have the information I otherwise wouldn't have. But on the other hand, all these processes, no matter how convoluted, exist for a reason. It feels weird bypassing those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you aware that the API appears to be publishing the SSN of each individual? Although I’m aware most SSNs are leaked in one breach or another, I still thought it was customary in the U.S. to attempt to keep such information somewhat protected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of literate programming, which emphasizes writing code that is easily readable and understandable by humans in addition to being executable by machines. It highlights the importance of documenting the thought process behind the code and integrating narrative and code together. The author argues that this approach fosters better understanding and communication among programmers while also serving as a self-documenting method. The post includes insights into tools and techniques that facilitate literate programming, promoting a shift in how coding can be approached to enhance clarity and collaboration in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are at least two aspects to literate programming.Knuth wrote TeX in Pascal, which has a couple of limitations that annoyed him:- Pascal has no module system: you can’t break a program up into multiple files- The order of presentation of a program is dictated by the needs of a single-pass compilerThe tooling that supports literate programming is mostly about overcoming these problems with Pascal. (Knuth also uses it to split up larger procedures in a manner that makes me think of very un-structured C macros.) Most other languages are more flexible so they have much less need for a technology like tangle/weave.The opposite extreme is Literate Haskell, which doesn’t need any preprocessor. You just feed your TeX document to ghc and it picks the code out of the \begin{code} blocks. Or instead of Knuth style you can write in Bird style, where the file is a plain text document with code marked by &gt; quote blocks.The other aspect of literate programming is organizing the code like a book. This is very difficult to do well. When I think of how I approach a codebase, it reminds me of textbooks that have a complicated diagram describing multiple suggested orders of reading (a chapter per module?), or the informal introduction to Algol 68 with its orthogonal table of contents. Ideally a program’s commentary should span both the explanatory and reference documentation quadrants.What strikes me about Knuth’s literate programming is how hypertextual it is, albeit using printed cross-references and indexes. It seems to be in desperate need of interactive pixels. And an underlying programming language that has better support for Knuth’s preferred size of code fragment.On balance I think modern tools achieve Knuth’s goals better than tangle/weave. Modern languages let you organize code much closer to its narrative structure, without WEB’s unhygienic scoping. Editors and IDEs and documentation browsers give you hyperlinks everywhere.It’s then “just” a matter of writing the exposition. Less literate programming, more literate programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a lot of time thinking about no/low code and one conclusion I came to was that there was "the program" and then there was the way it displayed.  Considerhttps://www.knime.com/why-visual-workflowsthe topology of the connection between the blocks is essential to execute the program;  that doesn't require coordinates for the blocks,  but the visual editor does.  The ideal tool has a clean separation between these.  People are dimly aware of the "hairball" graph problem and looking for a visualization algorithm that banishes them:https://blog.tomsawyer.com/untangle-the-hairball-with-bundle...yet the real problem is that if your goal is to communicate you want to tell stories with visualizations and you need a visualization organized around a story -- and for each story you tell you need a different visualization.I see the same thing with literate software.  I can think of a number of interesting stories to tell about last month's chess program (e.g. "move generation",  "alpha-beta search",  for instance.)  For a particular story I want to focus on certain things and completely eliminate other things.  The same code might appear in more than one story.  To make all this work there has to be a clean separation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with literate programming is that most people aren’t good writers, and they aren’t interested in developing their writing skills - they only want to code.Already it’s pulling teeth just to get literate commit messages…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683009</guid></item><item><title>37.

Our motivation for developing CopperSpice was to change the core design of the libraries leveraging modern C++ functionality.&gt; The redesign allowed us to completely remove the Meta-Object Compiler (moc) system. Moc is a code generator and did not support many aspects of modern C++ including templates, complex data types, static type checking, and relied heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves run time performance, reduces the complexity of the build process, and allows more issues to be detected at compile time.This sounds pretty great. Does anyone have experience using it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any reason to not upstream the refactorings?The default theme doesn't look that great on mobile. At least one can change the side menu size.The challenges I'm facing with doxygen is to create a seamless integration with a MkDocs site, but not just for a single version. The current workaround of manually copying the generated MkDocs header and footer isn't very automated...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Supports C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, (Corba and Microsoft) IDL, Objective-C, Python, PHP, TCLWondering how Python support stacks up against Sphinx.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page 29 is the first code.  You need to work through 'War and Peace' of text before you get there.  This is not good for a "young person".  They need to get there quicker IMHO.I always say that the reason I got into programming (at the age of 10) was because of the BBC Micro User Guide [1].* Page 5: first code written (and importantly, code that has a visual component)* Page 6: Drawing lines* Page 7: Playing soundsetc.I realised very quickly that I was able to make a game.  And that was it, I was hooked for life.The Raspberry Pi took its inspiration from the BBC Micro (Model B).  It's a shame that there wasn't more of a push to make it as easy as the original Model B to get going and start programming.(Of course I realise that it's running Linux where nothing is simple, but yeah, I'm not sure it necessarily helps kickstart the next generation in the way the original BBC Micro did)[1] https://archive.org/details/BBCUG/mode/2up?view=theater&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To install the BCPL System on the Raspberry Pi you must first ob-
tain a copy of the file bcpl.tgz [...]Version numbers, what are those ...When you have some problem with bcpl.gz, just send an e-mail. Be sure to mention the approximate date when you obtained bcpl.gz. Like was it closer to Halloween last year, or more toward Thanksgiving or Christmas? Be sure to download bcpl.tgz daily, until the problem goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice introduction text with detailed description to set-up a R.Pi and interesting examples (AES, calculating Euler's number, Rubik's cube etc.).  Shame it uses an utterly obsolete language of which most interesting feature (byte code interpreter making porting the compiler to new architectures comparatively easy) was important in the seventies with its plethora of architectures (many short-lives), but hardly today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673435</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the evolution of skyscraper architecture, focusing on the trend of utilizing glass as the primary material in modern towers. It discusses factors contributing to this phenomenon, including advancements in technology, the quest for natural light, and the desire for aesthetic appeal. The emphasis on transparency and the minimalist design of glass facades reflect both functional and cultural shifts in urban environments, highlighting how these structures symbolize modernity and progress while addressing energy efficiency and sustainability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two lines that summarize the article for me:&gt; Why developers chose glass curtain walls -
So why did developers embrace the glass box aesthetic? Unsurprisingly, it comes down to economics.&gt; Ornamentation and glass curtain wall aren’t mutually exclusive.And while I agree that ornamentation is very likely lost to cost savings, the switch to glass walls is also just a huge improvement for people inside the building.Having worked in an all-glass tower and also a "normal" office building, my personal experience is that the natural light that giant windows let in and the external views that they afford are both phenomenal improvements to the atmosphere. It's really a much more pleasant environment to work in. The only catch is that the interior or window treatment design needs to consider glare from sunlight directly hitting computer screens and/or eyes.So, sure, maybe something something costs, but people also pay attention to environmental ergonomics now in ways that they never used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Air conditioning was becoming common, making it possible to cool buildings with large expanses of windows that might otherwise get too hot in the summer.I guess the cost of having to install and run AC is dwarfed by the savings in construction costs?Or is this a case of operational costs being ignored in favor of capital costs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always thought large buildings have more windows because the inner spaces would otherwise get 0 natural light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683736</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've been using Taskfile, which is fantastic and super understandable, but it's only a task-runner and as such wouldn't meet OP's needs. I hated `just` and did not find it at all intuitive.Only problem I have with the article is saying that Ruby doesn't work on Windows is just categorically false. It's one of the easiest languages to install and use on Windows, even easier than C# and Java, and I'm a Java/Kotlin dev, so that's saying something. It's literally just a single exe/msi installer.But you wouldn't want to be using Rake anyway, it's not really that good, and is only useful if you're working in an environment where you don't want to install anything and you hate Make. Then Ruby is very often installed by default with Rake and so you get a 'free' build tool. Rake was good 10 years ago, but not so much anymore.Anyway, if you needed a specific kind of tool and built it then all the power to you. Can't blame you for not wanting to use the other options!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish you success with this! I really was surprised to see that there isn’t a modern make replacement that actually does what make does, and does it well: build /compile things with a notion of inputs and outputs and out-of-date checks. Most appear to be “just” command runners. That’s a very useful thing to have, but it’s not really a make replacement.
Then again, many “build tools” do get very large and unwieldy eventually, so maybe it’s more a case of the good make replacements simply getting too much traction…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why a new language?In my opinion, Starlark (in rust, Apache 2: &lt;https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust/blob/v0.13.0/LICEN...&gt;) is the way since it is designed for sandboxed environments and also (AIUI) was initially designed to support Bazel, a build toolNow, I'm totally on board that people can hate on whitespace sensitive languages, but if my choice was "make my own language that no one has ever heard of" or "delete the Python hater's emails" ...It also would mean that you could tag your Werkfile in .gitattributes with linguist annotations[1] and they'd syntax highlight, which isn't the case with your own language https://github.com/simonask/werk/blob/5990c8a9536a1a76c3da59...1: https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/v9.0.0/docs...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672863</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;New York has begun enforcing a new broadband law aimed at enhancing accessibility and affordability of internet service, despite significant opposition from internet service providers (ISPs) who attempted to block its implementation. The law mandates that ISPs offer plans for $15 per month to low-income households, with the goal of increasing connectivity for underserved communities. The article discusses the background of the legislation, the resistance from ISPs, and the potential impact on consumers and the broadband market in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The New York law requiring Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes will take effect on Wednesday this week following a multi-year court battle in which the state defeated broadband industry lobby groups.I don't like these types of mandates because it distorts the market. Politicians get to say "we provided X people with internet service and we didn't use a dollar of tax payers' money". Which sounds nice, but you can't really get something for nothing. This will increase costs for ISPs and likely increase prices for others. How much? Who knows!If politicians feel that low income New Yorkers deserve reduced cost or free internet, give them a voucher for internet. Better yet, figure out how much of a voucher they would need and give them a check. Let them decide whether they want to buy internet, or better food or housing or whatever else. Or if you go the voucher router, giving them options lets ISPs compete for this. Don't think taxpayers should pay? Make a special ISP tax and give it to these people to make it budget neutral.Not to mention the red tape and abuse this will create. I really don't want me ISP to track my income.What they decided on is the worst possible option as it results in hidden costs and bad incentives. The only people its good for (compared to the alternatives), is politicians who can by dictate just seemingly create free things for people for no cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Price increases are to be capped at 2 percent per year, and state officials will periodically review whether minimum required speeds should be raised.2% is below current inflation rates, so this could potentially go haywire super easily.New York has been here before; the subway was fixed to a nickel for four decades, which ended up bankrupting the private subway companies and set the stage for the underfunded, deferred maintenance of future decades, which New York is still working through the backlog for nearly a hundred years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I agree that people getting internet in this day and age is _basically_ a necessity (and thus the govt should interfere when needed to make that happen), doing it in this way is the worse possible implementation. Was it necessary in this case? I don't know.First, foster competition. I don't know the NY landscape, but in the West Coast, it's not uncommon for a residency to have effectively a single option for ISP. Ensure consumers have options (incentivize creation of new ISPs? Stop allowing big corporations to buy small ones? break up big corporations and force them to compete?)Second could the government offer public internet? (ie, be a player in the market).Only as a last resort should these types of heavy hand price enforcements should be taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42687861</guid></item><item><title>45.

All this other crap, all these holiday parties, all of this let's dance in diversity videos, no that's not what I'm here for .Most of the time coming to the office actually adds a bunch of unnecessary crap that is completely unneeded. If you can't get your job done remotely, what's the stop you from also slacking off in the office. I have to go back to the office for a while last year times were hard and I didn't have another option .We're just talking to each other, shooting the s**, and it was cool to meet some Junior Devs who were just starting their career. But none of that made me a more productive worker.If I had to think, I imagine the entire point of RTO mandates is to keep cities sustainable.If every single office job went remote, what's the point of a city like New York. Who's going to willingly pay $6,000 for an apartment, ride the trains for over an hour a day, if you can just sit at home in a much cheaper city .However, to quote a famous philosopher, it's a big club and you ain't in it. The powers that be one as many people in office chairs as possible, so they're real estate holdings appreciate in value.Billy Bob's bagels also benefits from this, although I'd imagine he's not able to have the same amount of pool as the real estate titans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think RTO mandates will be the straw that broke the camel's back, for a lot of Americans. Workers in sectors that previously wouldn't even think about unionizing, are now having serious discussions.Going back to commutes, wasting time, for no obvious reason - yeah, that did wake up people.EDIT: I'm talking about rigid 5 days a week RTO policy. As other have pointed out, having a flexible WFH policy is often "good enough" for most people. Not all want 100% WFH, but taking away the flexibility of WFH a couple of days a week, if you want, feels like a shitty deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally think for many jobs, in-person is actually better.SWE in a place with good process, remote is probably fine. Generally similar for jobs with clear deliverables on that kind of time scale. if it's more research oriented, there is a huge benefit to being in-person in front of a whiteboard. For a job with shifting requirements day to day (like some legal or banking work), it is easier to coordinate everyone in the same office.unclear if this overcomes cost to employees of the commute, housing, etc., but the value is there.however there is also "worst of all possible worlds" RTO, where you have to commute to the office because the office is the place you are required to sit for your 4+ hours of Zoom calls per day with other colleagues in other offices. I expect a lot of companies are going to do this, which is totally stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688159</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;on year 7 of my startup and profitable. I'd like to add a few things.1. look for a boring problem that needs solving. related to the product market fit. a lot of founders are trying to build a sexy solution to a problem that no one has.2. Sales is half the equation!. you can have the best engineering team in the world but it means nothing if you dont have good sales. and good sales people don't just get sales. they are the first point of contact for your prospective customers. Empower them to get feedback and ideas for how to evolve your product. half of our features at my startup are things we never would have thought of until our sales guys kept telling us how many restaurants were requesting the feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, I got it. If I want to make a successful startup, I simply just need to get an insane amount of funding and develop a great product based on detailed market research that fits the market and solves an actual problem. I also should find a way to actually sell a product in order to avoid negative cash flow problems.This reminds me a bit of the main reason why restaurant businesses fail according to some TV shows I've watched: They have a lousy cook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article must be pretty great to make it to the front page while messing about with how scrolling works:-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660424</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon known as "Havana Syndrome," characterized by mysterious health issues reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers, primarily in Cuba and later in other countries. It delves into the theories surrounding its cause, including potential foreign attacks using advanced technology, with a particular focus on Russia's possible involvement. The piece examines the government’s response, the ongoing investigations, and the implications for U.S.-Russia relations, while highlighting the challenges faced in conclusively identifying the syndrome's origins and the broader impact on personnel safety in diplomatic missions.&lt;/p&gt;

We already know directed-energy weapons are possible [0], what are the challenges in exploring the space until you're able to build an approximate match for what people report having experienced?The most scary thing about these kinds of systems seems to me to be the potential for urban terrorism. If it doesn't leave any trace and it can penetrate walls, it could be used to attack people working for rival organizations as well as general harassment. Imagine a tool that lets you disrupt someone's sleep, using that over months would be enough to drive them insane or at least seriously hamper their productivity and performance. For example: if a rival sports team is visiting and you're able to disrupt their sleep that might be enough to give your team an edge.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential banning of the game "Luck Be a Landlord" from Google Play due to concerns related to its gambling themes and mechanics. It explores the implications of such a ban on the game's accessibility and the broader impact on similar games within the digital marketplace. The piece highlights community reactions, developer responses, and the ongoing conversation about gambling regulations in mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;LBAL and Balatro being banned or 18+ age-gated for having gambling "vibes" despite not actually simulating gambling, while the stores are full of gacha games which are designed to bleed players dry through real-money gambling mechanics is a ridiculous state of affairs. The latter makes Google and Apple insane amounts of money though so of course they're not going to do anything about them unless their hand is forced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a “finished” game or app on google play has never worked well for me. 
There is constant nag to update it for a variety of reasons. Even if the nag comes from device related sdk updates (just recompiles), a reupload requires you to comply with latest policies that often seem very subjective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be fair, if you were to design a game meant to create false positives for gambling, it would probably be a game just like this.While a sympathize with the dev, this is a bit like carrying around a replica gun in public and complaining that you constantly have to ward off police reports.Parents are gonna see the slots and file reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683567</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so few people blog these days makes blogging even more influential than it used to be.You can establish yourself as something of a global expert on some topic just by writing about it a few times a month over the course of a year!Don't expect people to come to your blog. Practice https://indieweb.org/POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere - post things on your blog and then tweet/toot/linkedin/submit-to-hacker-news/share-in-discord etc.Also, don't worry too much about whether you get traffic at the time you write something. A lot of the reputational value comes from having written something that you can link people to in the future. "Here are my notes about that topic from last year: LINK" - that kind of thing.There's a lot to be said for writing for its own sake, too. Just writing about a topic forces you to double-check your understanding and do a little bit more research. It's a fantastic way of learning more about the world even if nobody else ever reads it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define "worth it", but I've written a blog post about some printer driver issue two years ago and it now happened twice that someone (Older person, not very technical) reached out over email and asked for some further help and I could walk them step by step through using a Terminal, booting into macOS recovery mode and fixing the issue.The Apple store and Epson told them to do a clean install so they were very grateful and it made me happy that I could help them. Worth it for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I write for myself. I don't track, I don't care if people read my blog.I do mention my blog on my resume together with code repositories. It is some kind of portfolio, and it is a good learning experience for me.I don't think that it is worth "building a brand", unless you want to specialize in building brands. It's not like someone at Google will ever read your blog and offer you a job; if you want to work at Google, learn how to pass their interview process. If you want to be visible on social media, probably you need to follow a ton of people, engage with them, produce a lot of content and the kind of content that people like or repost. This has nothing to do with a personal blog, though.Another thing is that if you find it worth blogging about, it's probably niche in the first place. If it's common knowledge, it's probably already on Wikipedia, or StackOverflow, or now some LLM (and if you wait long enough, your blog will be part of the LLM, whether you want it or not).I see it like FOSS: if you do it with the hope that many people will use it, then I think it's a bad idea. Because you work for free and people will never be happy. If you do it for yourself, it's great!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42685534</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godot uses their own engine features for the GUI of the editor itself as you’d use to make a game itself with.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/list_of_feature...&gt; Godot's GUI is built using the same Control nodes used to make games in Godot. The editor UI can easily be extended in many ways using add-ons.And they even go as far as to explicitly say the following:&gt; Godot's small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to frameworks like Electron or Qt.I’ve only used Godot for game development, not GUI stuff yet. (The game I started making doesn’t have any menus, I’m working on gameplay and level design first.) But I’m personally keeping a mental note in the back of my mind to investigate building bona fide desktop applications with Godot also, and not just games.Also, if you’re going to make an application instead of a game, they have a special mode they recommend that you use:&gt; When creating a non-game application, make sure to enable low-processor mode in the Project Settings to decrease CPU and GPU usage.https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#is-it-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For truly novel UIs with high dynamism it is probably a good decision.For anything else it is almost certainly more work for the dev and more resource-intensive for the system.One thing I haven't seen anyone else mention is that a game engine is generally going to be re-rendering constantly, as part of the game/render loop. This is because in a game it is almost always the case that something is changing on screen at any given moment.In a more "normal" app UI, most things are static, so having a render loop operate like that doesn't make much sense. So instead things are optimized for the static case – if nothing is happening on screen, resources are not being used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It really depends on your App and probably the game engine.There's a reason why a lot of people use Electron for apps and it's because the amount of effort it takes to write HTML / JS and have a functional UI is very little.It seems like you like the idea in order to implement a novel UI and I suspect then yes a game engine is a good idea. However, do consider the UX of your app. Excel is a spreadsheet because that is pretty much the best way to display tabular data. So if the novel UI isn't a better UX than an existing way you probably don't want to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672339</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a malicious npm package by Snyk, which was designed to target web applications by stealing sensitive data such as environment variables and API keys. It highlights how the package was able to evade detection by using obfuscation techniques and discusses the broader implications of such threats in the JavaScript ecosystem. The piece emphasizes the importance of security practices in software development and the need for continuous monitoring of dependencies to safeguard against vulnerabilities and malicious software.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of how NPM works, it's quite easy to trick it to fetch the packages from the public registry instead, which could be used by an attacker [0].Assumably, this Snyk employee either found or suspected that some part of Cursor's build is misconfigured as above, and uploaded those packages as a POC. (Given the package description "for Cursor", I'd think they were hired for this purpose.)If that's the case, then there's not much to see here. The security researcher couldn't have used a private NPM registry to perform the POC if the point is to demonstrate a misconfiguration which skips the private registry..[0] In particular, many proxies will choose the public over the private registry if the latest package version is higher: https://snyk.io/blog/detect-prevent-dependency-confusion-att...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also interestingly the Snyk cofounder has started a competitor to cursor

If you know what to look for, there are definite signals that these packages are dodgy.  All of these packages have just two files:  package.json and index.js (or main.js).  This is one of several flags that you can use to determine if a package is legit or not.This works -- maybe OK for top-level packages. But for transitive dependencies it's nearly impossible to vet every transitive dependency.If you're pulling in a package that has 400 dependencies, how the heck would you even competently check 10% of that surface area? https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#top-1000...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690473</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of creativity in various fields and emphasizes the importance of fostering an environment that encourages creative thinking. It explores the factors that contribute to creativity, such as openness to experience and the ability to connect disparate ideas. The author also provides practical suggestions for enhancing creativity, including engaging in diverse experiences, practicing mindfulness, and collaborating with others. Overall, the piece highlights creativity as a vital skill in problem-solving and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pure, disinterested A/B testing where the goal is just to find the good way to do it, and there's enough leverage and traffic that funding that A/B testing is worthwhile is rare.More frequently, A/B testing is a political technology that allows teams to move forward with changes to core, vital services of a site or app. By putting a new change behind an A/B test, the team technically derisks the change, by allowing it to be undone rapidly, and politically derisks the change, by tying it's deployment to rigorous testing that proves it at least does no harm to the existing process before applying it to all users. The change was judged to be valuable when development effort went into it, whether for technical, branding or other reasons.In short, not many people want to funnel users through N code paths with slightly different behaviors, because not many people have a ton of users, a ton of engineering capacity, and a ton of potential upside from marginal improvements. Two path tests solve the more common problem of wanting to make major changes to critical workflows without killing the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the assumptions of vanilla multi-armed bandits is that the underlying reward rates are fixed. It's not valid to assume that in a lot of cases, including e-commerce. The author is dismissive and hard wavy about this and having worked in in e-commerce SaaS I'd be a bit more cautious.Imagine that you are running MAB on an website with a control/treatment variant. After a bit you end up sampling the treatment a little more, say 60/40. You now start running a sale - and the conversion rate for both sides goes up equally. But since you are now sampling more from the treatment variant, its aggregate conversion rate goes up faster than the control - you start weighting even more towards that variant.Fluctuating reward rates are everywhere in e-commerce, and tend to destabilise MAB proportions, even on two identical variants, they can even cause it to lean towards the wrong one. There are more sophisticated MAB approaches that try to remove the identical reward-rate assumption - they have to model a lot more uncertainty, and so optimise more conservatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with this approach is that it requires the system doing randomization to be aware of the rewards. That doesn't make a lot of sense architecturally – the rewards you care about often relate to how the user engages with your product, and you would generally expect those to be collected via some offline analytics system that is disjoint from your online serving system.Additionally, doing randomization on a per-request basis heavily limits the kinds of user behaviors you can observe. Often you want to consistently assign the same user to the same condition to observe long-term changes in user behavior.This approach is pretty clever on paper but it's a poor fit for how experimentation works in practice and from a system design POV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650954</guid></item><item><title>3.

If exposing this to the Internet we recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy, such as SWAG, and ensuring a secure authentication solution is in place. From the web interface a terminal can be launched and it is configured for passwordless sudo, so anyone with access to it can install and run whatever they want along with probing your local network."I hope everyone intrigued by this interesting and potentially very useful project takes heed of this warning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selkies[1] is another interesting project in this space.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant security vulnerability in Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system that puts millions of users at risk. The flaw allows malicious actors to exploit certain permissions granted by users to access sensitive information without proper authorization. It highlights the potential impact of the vulnerability, advises on best practices for users to secure their accounts, and emphasizes the importance of robust security measures to protect against such flaws.

And isn't it also a failure on e.g. Microsoft or OpenAI's parts, since they're providing service to a defunct business entity who can't pay its bills?To describe this as a vuln in oauth doesn't really make sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don't understand here, the proper way to use Google's OpenID implementation to authenticate someone is to use the `sub` claim. Don't use the email, don't verify it yourself, use the `sub` claim. It's a known fact and is properly documented[1].If the `sub` changes, it's because it's not necessarily the same person so have a flow ready for that. It could be an employee left and came back, a domain change, an IT error that lead to a reprovisioning of the user, etc.I also fail to see how the proposed solution of having a 'A unique user ID that doesn’t change over time' is different from the `sub` claim. However, the new ID associated to the domain could make sense to enforce a strong 'Everyone from the @domain.com has access' statement.[1] https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is more of a fundamental issue with the way we rely on DNS to secure *gestures wildly* all the things. The fact that domains can expire and be registered by someone new allows the new owner to do almost anything the old owner could have done when it comes to anything trusting email addresses, or anything else relying on DNS (ACME certs) for authentication.It's great for "do they own this right now" validation and that's what we use it for, but beyond that links will be saved, email addresses will be added to databases and address books alike, and that's more or less a reality of most systems. For example, my snail mail (and occasionally packages) is still mistakenly delivered to my former addresses from time to time just because it's hard to track who has that address, and update it everywhere. The same goes for internet infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699099</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The fluid pendant project by MITxela showcases a unique and intricate kinetic sculpture that visually demonstrates fluid dynamics using a pendulum mechanism. The design features a pendulum with a reservoir that allows colored liquid to flow in conjunction with its swinging motion, creating mesmerizing patterns that highlight principles of physics and fluid behavior. The project emphasizes creativity in engineering and design, illustrating how art and science can combine to produce visually stunning and educational displays. It also provides insights into the development process and the technology used in the creation of the sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating video. I watched almost the whole thing without planning to, I got sucked in.This is one of those examples of software that reminds me of my struggle to understand how LLMs are passing code evaluations that culminate with people declaring that they are now better than even the best human coders. I have tried to get LLMs (specifically, Claude and ChatGPT, trying various models) to assist with niche problems and it's been a terrible experience. Fantastic with CRUD or common algorithms, terrible when it's something novel or unusual.The author creates his own version of a "FLIP simulation". I'm going to go out on a limb and posit that even ChatGPT's unreleased o3 model would not be up to the task of writing the software that powers this pendant. Is this incorrect? I realize perhaps that my comment is a little off-topic given that this is not an AI project. However, this project seems like an excellent example of the sort of thing that I am quite skeptical the supposedly "world-class" artificial software engineers could pull off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; access to a lathe is a fundamental human rightA teacher once told me their (middle? high?) school was the last in their state with lathes.  Something which couldn't be created there today, and couldn't exist now in some other states, but which had been repeatedly grandfathered, since its creation with many others, just after World War 2. And that it would disappear upon the first serious accident, leaving none at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charlieplexing:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683389</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice, these ideas have been around for a long time but never commercialized to my knowledge. I've done some experiments in this area with simulations and am currently designing some test circuitry to be fabbed via Tiny Tapeout.Reversibility isn't actually necessary for most of the energy savings. It saves you an extra maybe 20% beyond what adiabatic techniques can do on their own. Reason being, the energy of the information itself pales in comparison to the resistive losses which dominate the losses in adiabatic circuits, and it's actually a (device-dependent) portion of these resistive losses which the reversible aspect helps to recover, not the energy of information itself.I'm curious why Frank chose to go with a resonance-based power-clock, instead of a switched-capacitor design. In my experience the latter are nearly as efficient (losses are still dominated by resistive losses in the powered circuit itself), and are more flexible as they don't need to be tuned to the resonance of the device. (Not to mention they don't need an inductor.) My guess would be that, despite requiring an on-die inductor, the overall chip area required is much less than that of a switched-capacitor design. (You only need one circuit's worth of capacitance, vs. 3 or more for a switched design, which quadruples your die size....)I'm actually somewhat skeptical of the 4000x claim though.  Adiabatic circuits can typically only provide about a single order of magnitude power savings over traditional CMOS -- they still have resistive losses, they just follow a slightly different equation (f²RC²V², vs. fCV²). But RC and C are figures of merit for a given silicon process, and fRC (a dimensionless figure) is constrained by the operational principles of digital logic to the order of 0.1, which in turn constrains the power savings to that order of magnitude regardless of process. Where you can find excess savings though is simply by reducing operating frequency. Adiabatic circuits benefit more from this than traditional CMOS. Which is great if you're building something like a GPU which can trade clock frequency for core count.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notably the physical limit ishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principleit doesn't necessarily take any energy at all to process information,  but it does take roughly kT work of energy to erase a bit of information.  It's related tohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demonas,  to complete cycles,  the demon has to clear its memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Henry G. Baker wrote this paper titled "The Thermodynamics of Garbage Collection" in the 90s about linear logic, stack machines, reversibility and the cost of erasing information:https://wiki.xxiivv.com/docs/baker_thermodynamics.htmlA subset of FRACTRAN programs are reversible, and I would love to see rewriting computers as a potential avenue for reversible circuit building(similar to the STARAN cpu):https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html#reversibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660606</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've enjoyed using ffmpeg 1000% more since I was able to stop doing manually the tedious task of Googling for Stack Overflow answers and cobbling them into a command and got Chat GPT to write me commands instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me I need to publish my write up on how I've been converting digitized home video tapes into clips using scene detection, but in case anyone is googling for it, here's a gist I landed on that does a good job of it [0] but sometimes it's fooled by e.g. camera flashes or camera shake so I need to give it a start and end file and have ffmpeg concatenate them back together [1]Weird thing is I got better performance without "-c:v h264_videotoolbox" on latest Mac update, maybe some performance regression in Sequoia? I don't know. The equivalent flag for my windows machine with Nvidia GPU is "-c:v h264_nvenc" . I wonder why ffmpeg doesn't just auto detect this? I get about 8x performance boost from this. Probably the one time I actually earned my salary at work was when we were about to pay out the nose for more cloud servers with GPU to process video when I noticed the version of ffmpeg that came installed on the machines was compiled without GPU acceleration ![0] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nielsbom/c86c504fa5fd61ae...[1] https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jazzyjackson/bf9282df0a40...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten pretty good at various bits of ffmpeg over time.  Its CLI has a certain logic to it... it's order dependent (not all unix CLIs are).Lately, I've been playing around with more esoteric functionality.  For example, storing raw video straight off a video camera on a fairly slow machine.  I built a microscope and it reads frames off the camera at 120FPS in raw video format (YUYV 1280x720) which is voluminous if you save it directly to disk (gigs per minute).  Disks are cheap but that seemed wasteful, so I was curious about various close-to-lossless techniques to store the exact images, but compressed quickly.  I've noticed that RGB24 conversion in ffmpeg is extremely slow, so instead after playing around with the command line I ended up with:  ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuyv422 -s 1280x720 -i test.raw  -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p  movie.mp4 -crf 13 -y

This reads in raw video- because raw video doesn't have a container, it lacks metadata like "pixel format" and "image size", so I have to provide those.  It's order dependent- everything before  "-i test.raw" is for decoding the input, and everythign after is for writing the output.  I do one tiny pixel format conversion (that ffmpeg can do really fast) and then write the data out in a very, very close to lossless format with a container (I've found .mkv to be the best container in most cases).Because I hate command lines, I ended up using ffmpeg-python which composes the command line from this:  self.process = (
            ffmpeg.
            input(
                "pipe:",
                format="rawvideo",
                pix_fmt="yuyv422",
                s="{}x{}".format(1280, 720),
                threads=8
            )
            .output(
                fname, pix_fmt="yuv422p", vcodec="libx264", crf=13 
            )  
            .overwrite_output()
            .global_args("-threads", "8")
            .run_async(pipe_stdin=True)
            )

and then I literally write() my frames into the stdin of that process.  I had to limit the number of threads because the machine has 12 cores and uses at least 2 at all times to run the microscope.I'm still looking for better/faster lossless YUV encoding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695547</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Servo" is a control method. You can control steppers using servo methods and it's pretty good actually. There are chinese encoder boards that'll do everything for like $10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a unusual servo. Servos usually have a small optical encoder that emits quadrature pulses as it rotates. That's immune to magnetic interference but can potentially miss counts. This servo seems to have an magnetic analog position sensor. Something like this.[1] Can't miss counts but has less noise immunity.[1] https://www.analog.com/en/products/adaf1080.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm gonna experiment with adding hall effect sensors to a standard servo to make a cheap feedback mechanism since those are pretty cheap nowadays seems like. Steppers still have a place but for hobby stuff with basic "what pos is it" this could be something I use a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697335</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After years in the making ZFS raidz expansaion is finally here.Major features added in release:  - RAIDZ Expansion: Add new devices to an existing RAIDZ pool, increasing storage capacity without downtime.

  - Fast Dedup: A major performance upgrade to the original OpenZFS deduplication functionality.

  - Direct IO: Allows bypassing the ARC for reads/writes, improving performance in scenarios like NVMe devices where caching may hinder efficiency.

  - JSON: Optional JSON output for the most used commands.

  - Long names: Support for file and directory names up to 1023 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just don't get it how the Windows world - by far the largest PC platform per userbase - still doesn't have any answer to ZFS. Microsoft had WinFS and then ReFS but it's on the backburner and while there is active development (Win11 ships some bits time to time) release is nowhere in sight. There are some lone warriors trying the giant task of creating a ZFS compatibility layer with some projects, but they are far from being mature/usable.How come that Windows still uses a 32 year old file system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good to see that they were pretty conservative about the expansion.Not only is expansion completely transparent and resumable, it also maintains redundancy throughout the process.That said, there is one tiny caveat people should be aware of:&gt; After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distributed among the larger set of disks. New blocks will be written with the new data-to-parity
ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694596</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For 2 years I built RAG apps for clients. They are not Code-Assistants but everytime I see code assistants solely relying on embeddings to find the right pieces as context, it feels wrong to me:Code is very well structured. Based on a starting point (current cursor, current file, or results of an embedding search result) you would probably fair better to traverse the code tree up and down building a tree or using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) as described in this blog post [4]. It's like a tree search in order to get relevant code pieces for a certain task, and it imitates what human coders do. It would integrate well into an agent loop to search relevant code.Aren't there any open source code assistants and plugins that do this? All I see are embedding searches for the big projects such as cursor, cline or continue.All I ever found were a few research efforts such as RepoGraph [1], CodeGraph [2] and one one codebase open sourced by Deutsche Telekom called advanced-coding-assistant [3]1 https://github.com/ozyyshr/RepoGraph2 https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.138633 https://github.com/telekom/advanced-coding-assistant-backend4 https://cyrilsadovsky.substack.com/p/advanced-coding-chatbot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand why we have so many companies working on vector databases when the real value is in fine tuned embeddings. Having recently evaluated vector DB’s to handle 100M+ nodes, everything will run you  $1 - 8k per month. Yet using embeddings fine tuned on a specific use case, will lower that 10X since you can get away with way coarser vectors.This makes so much intuitive sense - voyage please release an insurance focused model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently using voyage for my project for the following reasons:1. They are recommended by Anthropic on their docs2. They're focused on embeddings as a service, I somehow prefer this other than spread-thin large orgs like OpenAI, GoogleAI, etc.3. They got good standing on the huggingface mteb leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690818</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently the main attack facing Firefox is coming from advertising companies such as YouTube.It’s crazy to think that some software engineers might actually intentionally degrade user experience on non-Google browsers or for people using adblockers. The mentality here is pretty disturbing: it’s almost like punishing users for making the choice to browse the web without ads, or without the surveillance mechanisms that come with them. Instead of building a better experience, these engineers seem to be focused on sabotaging alternatives in the name of profit or control. The kind of mindset behind this reeks of the same tactics we see in some ad networks or big tech companies - if we can’t convince you to opt in, we’ll make sure you’re inconvenienced or frustrated until you do.It’s a dangerous precedent because it introduces a toxic game of cat-and-mouse, where the user is constantly playing defense, trying to protect themselves from deliberate misdirection. It’s not just an ethical concern, but also an issue of how we value user autonomy in the digital space.For the hackers out there, this is a opportunity to dig into the JavaScript code responsible for this. There’s almost certainly some interesting obfuscation or odd behavior hiding in the code, and by pulling it apart, we can both understand how these tactics work and build tools or methods to counteract them. Let’s make sure the only thing that slows down the web is bad design or slow servers, not malicious code aimed at punishing the user for making their own choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the closest we have to a browser not controlled by the corporate giants.
Sometimes Mozilla makes unpopular choices and people raise a stink about it, but we do that because we hold them to a higher standard. With Microsoft and Google, we just expect them to Do More Evil, with Mozilla we expect Good and will complain loudly when they fail to uphold our principles, and we recommend Firefox because we feel like it is possible to expect Good from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using mozilla for _years_ it got shit, then better, then shit, and now its close enough.The thing I _Love_ is container tabs. I can isolate empires by using container tabs to sandbox cookies and other web state. This means that ebay doesn't change my adverts to the last thing I searched on every site, and autoplay embedded youtube doesn't fuck up my video recommendations.It means I can hide my work gmail from my home, and separate search histories (although thats less relevant now with AI.)lastly, being able to scroll left and right on my tabs, rather than new ones being unaccesable is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696081</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article from Modal's GPU Glossary serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various terms and concepts related to GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). It provides clear definitions and explanations of technical jargon associated with GPU technology, including architecture, performance metrics, memory types, and applications in fields such as gaming, machine learning, and data visualization. The glossary aims to educate readers about GPU functionality, helping them make informed decisions whether they are professionals in the field or newcomers seeking to enhance their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weird part of the programming model is that threadblocks don't map 1:1 to warps or SMs. A single threadblock executes on a single SM, but each SM has multiple warps, and the threadblock could be the size of a single warp, or larger than the combined thread count of all warps in the SM.So, how large do you make your threadblocks to get optimal SM/warp scheduling? Well it "depends" based on resource usage, divergence, etc. Basically run it, profile, switch the threadblock size, profile again, etc. Repeat on every GPU/platform (if you're programming for multiple GPU platforms and not just CUDA, like games do). It's a huge pain, and very sensitive to code changes.People new to GPU programming ask me "how big do I make the threadblock size?" and I tell them go with 64 or 128 to start, and then profile and adjust as needed.Two articles on the AMD side of things:https://gpuopen.com/learn/occupancy-explainedhttps://gpuopen.com/learn/optimizing-gpu-occupancy-resource-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if this also included terms that are often used by Nvidia that apparently come from computer architecture (?) but are basically foreign to software engineers, like “scoreboard” or “math pipe”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really great work, suggest for a next post: the VRAM requirements estimation calculation for running models locally. Especially with different architecture and different Quants, it gets always confusing and even online calculators give different answer. I never found a really good deep dive on this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675529</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "death by a thousand cuts," which refers to the gradual and often unnoticed accumulation of small issues that may lead to significant problems over time. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing these minor issues early on to prevent larger failures in various aspects of life, including personal well-being, relationships, and organizational management. The piece encourages proactive measures and awareness to address small challenges before they escalate, advocating for a more mindful approach to handling difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a NixOS user and contributor.This post is fair.Nix is very flexible, and it hasn't yet stabilised on a firm set of recommendations for a happy path.Going on a whim:* Use nixos-unstable. It's defacto stable, and gets much more attention than nixos-stable.* Use flakes.* Don't use multiple versions of nixpkgs. In the rare case a package is failing to build, then raise an issue, or wait, or rollback.* On NixOS, don't use user profiles. They won't interop in the way OP hopes.* Only use nixpkgs. If you absolutely must use another flake, only use popular ones from https://github.com/nix-community.But until the community give opinionated suggestions, users will stray towards bad practices.(Also, no need to mix pipewire and jack. Pipewire can emulate jack.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that so much of the divide in the tech field is simply between the two camps of "the tools are the interesting part" vs "getting things done with the tools is the interesting part".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on the fence about Nix. I've wanted to love it (and do love the concept), but between the Waiting-for-Godot situation for flakes, the weird language, and the occasional political infighting I've seen pop up about the community, I still haven't switched.I'm no language expert, but I genuinely don't understand why it wouldn't have been better to build some equivalent DSL in Haskell to do this given the similar lazy nature of the language. DSL for most things, then open the hood and do actual Haskell for crazier use cases. I get that Nix started before Haskell became less academic and slightly more usable in the mainstream and has built up momentum, but the lack of tooling for understanding what is going wrong when incrementally building up a config is very confusing.I'd be curious if anyone has go to or from NixOS compared to declarative distros compared to the atomic distros like ublue [0] and has any thoughts. I'm a bit split about what to move to next (though my &gt;5 year Tumbleweed install on most of my machines is holding up no problem).[0] https://universal-blue.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666851</guid></item><item><title>16. 1 in 5 online job postings are either fake or never filled, study finds</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/1-in-5-online-job-postings-are-either-fake-or-never-filled-study-finds-2000549706</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;A recent study reveals that about 20% of online job postings are either fraudulent or remain unfilled, highlighting the prevalence of fake job ads in the digital job market. This issue can mislead job seekers, wasting their time and resources. The report emphasizes the need for greater transparency and verification processes in online job listings to protect applicants and improve the job search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been required to create fake job postings because of US immigration policy.From the line manager perspective, how it looks is you have a colleague who has been working with you for several years who is on a H1B visa. They want to get a green card and become a permanent resident. To support this, we are required to post a fake job ad for their position, and invent a reason to reject any US citizens who apply for the position. (Non-US applications are ignored.)Our legal advice was that the job posting had to be contain only legitimate requirements for the role, so it could not be highly tailored to only match the resume of the employee seeking PERM status. The result was phone screen interviews were required to reject 8-10 on-paper-potentially-qualified US applicants for the fake position.This is for a highly specialized area within finance, where in real hiring there is an immense effort to find the strongest candidates regardless of nationality.In hindsight I am confident that earlier in my career I had applied to at least one such fake role. One not-well-known advantage of working with a recruiter as a job seeker in such a field is the recruiter will have back-channel information to know to ignore such fake job postings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the rate of non-fill is higher. But the reasons for it are all over the map. Everything from "we always leave a posting up even when we're not really looking just in case the perfect candidate happens to walk through the door" but in the mean time nobody really pays attention to applicants, to "we weren't getting the applicants we wanted with this posting, so we took it down and are trying a new posting," to "we're legally obligated to post this, but we already have a plan about hiring" whether it's someone connected, someone internal, or a preference for H1B workers, to all kinds of other scenarios. Anybody who has ever applied for a dozen jobs, sent literate applications and outreach, and has heard from most of them never to months later regardless of actual fit for the job knows this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've posted this story before, but it's relevant.About two years ago, I was looking for a job, and a recruiter reached out about a software engineering position at a prominent newspaper [1].I told the recruiter to apply me, they did, and they made me sit through a two hour video course on ethics and sexual harassment, which was weird considering that I hadn't even done an interview yet.About a week later, the recruiter gets back to me, and they declined me because  my resume "reads too much like a manager, no hands-on coding experience".I was extremely confused, because most of the time people say the opposite, that my resume is too in the weeds, and I need to focus on high-level stuff. Moreover, I don't have any managerial experience on my resume...every role says something like "software engineer".And then it hit me: the hiring manager never read my resume. He already knew who he wanted to hire for the role, and for either legal or compliance or bureaucratic reasons, he had to make it look like he was looking for other candidates, and in the process, he wasted my time and the recruiter's.[1] Not going to say which one but you've definitely heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article advocates for a decentralized social media landscape, emphasizing that platforms like Mastodon empower users to own their online interactions rather than relying on centralized corporate entities. It discusses the importance of user independence and the benefits of community-led moderation, encouraging a shift towards federated networks where individuals have more control over the content and connections they engage with. The piece underscores the idea that social media should serve the public good, fostering spaces where diverse voices can thrive without the risk of being silenced by profit-driven motives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm impressed by Eugen. Giving up full ownership is absolutely the right thing to do. But most people in this situation would become too greedy and start rationalizing why they should be in control (benevolent dictator). Hats off! Mastodon is heading in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon is on the right track. They’ve been doing so much right, the UX has improved considerably.I think there’s some mainstream appeal, but there are also ecosystem issues that aren’t solved easily, as well as a lack of algorithmic curation, which a lot of people deem very important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; lack of algorithmic curationThey can get that elsewhere. Mastodon will never win that battle. It's not wrong to want algorithms feeding you content, it's just that Mastodon will always be like the tenth best option for those users, and they always will be. Mastodon's advantage is with users that don't want posts written for algorithms. (I used Twitter that way for many years, but when they killed off Tweetdeck I visited less and less, to the point that I just don't often go there any longer.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681976</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a detailed introduction to structured log probabilities in the context of machine learning and natural language processing. It discusses the concept of log probabilities, emphasizing their importance for understanding model predictions and improving performance in tasks such as sequence generation. The site includes technical explanations, examples, and discussions on implementation, aimed at helping practitioners and researchers utilize structured log probabilities effectively in their work. It serves as a resource for understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

Somehow I didn't realize that logprobs were being returned as part of the OAI requests, and I really like this application of it.Any interest in seeing this sort of thing being added to llama.cpp?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was under the impression that log probabilities don't work like that / they aren't really useful to be interpreted as probabilities?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684629&gt; the logits aren't telling you anything like 'what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token', but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model's belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an 'action' and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698753</guid></item><item><title>22.

When Pyiodide came out I was excited but it was a bit difficult to use, this looks and feels fantastic.I really like Observable as well, but I've found it difficult to find robust and broad numerical libraries in javascript like what Python has.I would love for this type of tool to redefine how we do science. It would be amazing if many scientific papers included both their data and the code in an interactive environment with zero installs and configuration. Plus when discussing a paper you could "fork" it and explore different analysis options live which for many fields would be totally feasible to do in the browser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700852</guid></item><item><title>23.

https://web.archive.org/web/20240919110243/https://www.sdf.c...In December 2024 the page had been updated to now compare "dbt Core" against "SDF with dbt":
https://web.archive.org/web/20241217172451/https://www.sdf.c...Little marketing switcharoo there to avoid pissing off their future owners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats to the SDF team for their exit.Alas, dbt Labs has developed a reputation for rug pulling functionality from dbt Core and gating most of their differentiating features behind dbt Cloud. I cannot see this type of consolidation being in the best interest of the dbt community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious if this product actually works because I was beating my head against almost exactly this very recently.I haven't checked yet, but is SDF schema-dependent? For some reason, all sql comprehending/transforming tools I can find are either too trivial to be useful or require an exact schema to operate, both of which are too brittle to be useful when I try to use them in anger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697764</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub status page details an incident that occurred, specifically an issue affecting certain functionalities of GitHub services. The incident began on a specific date and time and is accompanied by updates on its progress, including when the issue was detected, actions taken by the team to resolve it, and the ultimate resolution. The page serves to keep users informed about service interruptions and the status of various GitHub features during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangential at best but I work in a regulated industry and we're starting to get some heavy scrutiny from external auditors and regulators on the way we plan to address extended outages and forced exits from third party vendors.  This goes beyond basic DR/BCP and plans are reviewed with at least a high level scenario exercise.https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/09/2023-12...On the surface a product like managed git repos would seem to be relatively straightforward to deal with, but these same regulated firms are also under tremendous scrutiny for access management, change management, SDLC, etc etc.  They also have a huge software footprint which just increases the impact.Self-hosting is obviously the traditional answer, but that's not exactly a simple one either.Just an interesting problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's almost as if only Git is distributed, but people sold out to Github for convenience. Too bad Git lacks a distributed bug tracker and wiki system like Fossil. Guess Github has to fail a lot more for things to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was down for ~2 hours. The status website claims "degraded performance", but in reality we get    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

Either GitHub didn't know how to communicate, or they were not sure about the real impact.This is bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42691184</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;Recent research from Oak Ridge National Laboratory highlights that global plant uptake of carbon dioxide has increased by nearly one-third over the past several decades. This rise in CO2 absorption is attributed to various factors, including climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and shifts in land use. The study emphasizes the significance of understanding how plants respond to increasing CO2, as this could have implications for carbon management strategies and climate mitigation efforts. The findings suggest that while plants are currently absorbing more CO2, future changes in climate and land use could affect this capacity, necessitating ongoing research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"rises by nearly one third" sounds a bit strange to me, more correct would be "Plant CO2 uptake is currently underestimated by one third according to new research"?&gt; The research, detailed in the journal Nature, is expected to improve Earth system simulations that scientists use to predict the future climate, and spotlights the importance of natural carbon sequestration for greenhouse gas mitigation.Too bad that we are currently doing the exact opposite (cutting down more forest than is regrown)...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of change is deeply worrying, because on the face of it, it implies means estimates of climate change are potentially rather unsound - such large changes in mechanisms central to change - and so climate change could be much worse than we expect.If climate change isn't so bad, then phew, but if it's actually worse, then we are in even more deadly trouble than we already are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As I understand the article; it’s not that we found out that they’ve _started_ absorbing more CO2; it’s that the previous estimations were flawed and we have new, improved ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696517</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the phenomenon of MrBeast, a prominent YouTuber known for his extravagant philanthropic stunts and challenges. It explores the cultural impact of his content, analyzing how he engages with audiences and the broader implications of his wealth and influence in online media. The piece discusses the mechanics behind his success, including his unique approach to storytelling, the dynamics of virality, and the interplay between entertainment and genuine charitable efforts. It raises questions about the ethics of such platforms and the nature of digital fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696691"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all – the essay is phenomenal and his book is available online for free – https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/youtube-apparatus/36...&gt; “Communication within the YouTube Apparatus has no meaning.” The rapid feedback loop between creators and audiences (as constructed by platform metrics) means that the system more and more responds to itself. Rather than trying to go somewhere (as is the case with political ideology), the creator seeks simply intensification, to draw more and more of the world into his whirlpool of content.This idea – that meaning is replaced by intensification – helps me understand a lot about the world today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ran a YouTube channel seriously for a couple of years.  Chasing the whims of the algorithm contributed to burnout and now I only release one or two videos a year.My reason for starting a channel was to have a discussion around some of the projects I was working on that I found interesting.  This never materialized.  I never had a ton of engagement, but if I did most questions asked by viewers that are answered in the video.I monetized my videos and started making beer-money amounts of revenue.  I put more and more time into them but never gained traction. I had a few "evergreen" videos that would make maybe a thousand bucks a year, the rest of the videos hardly got any views at all.Eventually, I found myself making videos to feed the algorithm not because it was a project that I wanted to do.  This is where I had to stop.  I realized that I just don't like editing videos.My channel makes no revenue now because YouTube requires an upload schedule and shorts.  Mr Beast's job sounds awful to me. The videos I make now only get dozens to hundreds of views when they're published.  I mostly share them with friends and in online communities where the info contained might be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top of the heap (Mr Beast, Nastya, Ryan, etc), this is true:&gt; The ideal creator has no distance between themselves and their persona. They have been interpellated by audience metrics; their subjective experience already takes audience reactions into account.&gt; Or more simply, YouTubers are not “Creators” but Creations. Audiences, rationalized by the platform, and the vloggers who upload the videos those audiences consume are not separable either theoretically or empirically.It's pretty obvious, too, because these YouTubers have a distinct theme where their popularity is dependent on 1) the whims and algos of the platform on one side, and 2) the ability for their audience to care and relate to something pretty dang detached and irrelevant from their everyday lives (unboxing, aggressive acts of charity, etc).While you hear plenty (Most? All?) YouTubers complain about the ranking algorithms &amp; capriciousness of their overlord, I don't believe most channels are quite as vapid as those at the top of the heap.  Lots of deep subjective content, and lots of freaking annoying CapCut edits, but also a primary focus on meaningful content relevent to viewers.  These people may not be getting rich from their vlogging, but it's also not fair to call what most of them are doing "vlogging", either.  It's video-based short form content curation for a clearly identified audience.  Not remotely the same as how the big guns like Mr Beast have to view their work [where they're much more similar to a cable TV network or a commercial production company than an independent producer].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696691</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four thoughts:1. I've developed a analog-&gt;digital path for my kids. Before they can get a music player, they get a CD player. Before they get video games, they get board games. And then, for video games, before they get Super Mario Odyssey they get the original Super Mario Bros. Each of these "first they get" is a long period. Years long. Give them something that has limitations so they can truly explore it. Find the nooks and crannies of something. Make up their own weird little things within that limitation. And then, back to music, I want my kids to know what a musical album is, know how to savor the highs and the lows, how sometimes certain tracks mean more to you based on your mood or life-stage, then just an endless playlist of newness.2. The gorilla in the room is that most adults can barely handle online media.3. The other gorilla in the room is porn. Again, see #2.4. The classic philosophers placed Prudence as the queen of virtues. What is prudence? It is essentially the ability to grasp reality. Why did they say that was most important? Because you couldn't use any of the other virtues if your didn't have a good grasp of reality (e.g. fortitude would be foolhardiness if you ran into a ill-conceived death thinking you were being brave).You need to make sure you and your kids are able to grasp reality, not just the appearance of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our kids? Hell, my wife and I don't use social media, except in very limited doses for work reasons. Our kids have zero access to it and never will. Their device usage is kept at a minimum and used for mostly educational or quality conversational purposes.I hate how many people now, whenever we're around them everyone has their phones out scrolling through 30 sec videos. They want to show you things which aren't funny, aren't entertaining, aren't informative... it's damn near Idiocracy levels of content consumption.[Insert video of someone badly dancing with caption that says "me."]Personally, I find it bizarre and extremely boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've 4 kids, the youngest is 11.The rule in the house is; 1) no social media accounts until 13 and 2) one of your parents will be your 'friend' on that account.This is actually a pretty great expression of "kids keep you young."But, right now is right now and how kids communicate with each other is constantly changing - social media or not.So, if you're not a parent to a tween or teens now - I'd say you have little to actually worry about as the landscape will be completely different in a decade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683494</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;datalist is one I stumbled upon and blew me away. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/da...It's not a replacement for select as you still need an input to tie it to but it seems to handle filtering a list of options nicely.Also, if you have two selects with the same list in it, you can do it once with datalist and have two inputs, say a list of clients with client_a and client_b for inputs.I don't quite care for how it displays the value, like if you put the ID as the value and the client name in the option element, you can filter by the ID or the name but the input will show the ID only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trick to prevent scrolling by setting overflow: hidden unfortunately results in visual page jumping for me.The reason is I have macOS set up to always show scroll bars, instead of hiding them. At least one browser (I forget which, but I test on Safari, Firefox and Chrome) doesn’t have a disabled scroll bar but removes it altogether. This makes the page wider and causes it to reflow and move.Does anyone know how to keep the scroll bar onscreen, just not enabled?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a neat piece of modern CSS:  body:has(dialog[open]) {
    overflow: hidden;
  }

https://caniuse.com/css-has confirms the has() selector has had widespread browser support since December 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42662265</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process and benefits of removing the pedals from a bicycle. It outlines the tools needed for the task, including a pedal wrench and an adjustable wrench, and provides a step-by-step guide to safely detach the pedals. The piece emphasizes the advantages of this action, such as making the bike easier to store, transport, or clean, and addresses common concerns, such as ensuring not to lose any small parts during the removal process. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for cyclists looking to optimize their bike's storage and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I taught my son to ride using training wheels. He rode around for a few days and asked me to take them off. So, I took them off. And when I came back outside from putting the tools and training wheels away, he was riding his bike as if he'd never not ridden it. I do like the author's idea however.By the way, did you know that the the right pedal is right hand thread, but the left pedal is left handed thread? If it wasn't, the left pedal, being right hand threaded, would come loose easily. And that was a Wright Brothers innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agree with the point of this post. I'd never heard of balance bikes, and then my wife did some research when we had our first kid and found out about this.We've now taught both of our kids to bike by starting with a balance bike, and the comparison with their friends who learned with training wheels was amazing - the balance bike kids were zooming around earlier, confidently, and with many fewer spills than the training wheel cohort.Also, you can get a balance bike with a handbrake, which sets them up well for getting a bike with handbrakes instead of coaster brakes. Kids bikes in the US have to be sold with coasters but there are several manufacturers (like woom) who make it really easy to remove the coaster and have front and rear hand brakes.Also also, most kids bikes in the US are too heavy: they're tough and cheap but it makes it hard to control them. Woom and Isla and probably a few others now make aluminum frame bikes for kids that are much more appropriate weight for their sizes, though at a bit of a cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how I teach people to drive stick, and they’ll learn within 30 minutes.
Put them on an empty road with a downward slope. The car will roll on its own, without them having to use the gas pedal. Then they can just practice switching into first without the risk of stalling.
After a few times integrate using the gas pedal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697467</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I turned out OK in public school, but I was held back at different points, particularly in math, because I (and a few others) were too far ahead of the other kids. We literally had to repeat an entire year of content at one point. Kudos to the teachers who enabled &amp; fostered that, but shame on the school system for not continuing to support. I'm pretty sure one of my classmates gave up on academics at that moment (he never really excelled again like he used to).I'd like my kids to be free to follow their curiosities.  It's definitely work to homeschool but for us, it may be worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved public school (class of 99). I still miss the style of learning. Can you imagine going deep on a topic for 50 minutes then switching? AP classes got double periods. I found it so refreshing and I learned a ton.Eg, science, math, study hall, lunch, Spanish, History, Art, English… in a single day?I loved it. What worked for me was studying for tests — and the harder the classes you took, the less homework there was (or it wasn’t required). I had a great history teacher, occasionally good math &amp; English teachers, a great art teacher, and mediocre science teachers. The science TEXTBOOKS were fabulous — you could just read through those things and become a genius.No more textbooks these days — it’s all some pdf segment to download. Bummer for my kids.These days, there are way fewer tests, so my kids always freak when they have tests. I thought tests were great! Just one focused period to perform and then move on. Homework and projects were a big problem for me, because I could never start early enough — it was always a last minute dash. Maybe that trained me to produce fast output, though.Kids were sometimes awful, but there was no way I was going to be popular so I just did my nerd thing. There were enough of us.They had a great drama program which I loved — I did every play and musical I could. And they even had a speech and debate club — so I competed at “extemporaneous” speech—when I went to state competitions, they got the students all together to clap me out like they’d do for the football team. That was unnecessary and funny for the nerd.My kids don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I fear. I was pretty lucky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK I guess I’m going to go against the deluge of comments here; And give an appreciable reason instead of denigrating those who might choose this.The context, though, I am British. I grew up in Britain. I went to British school.I can’t speak universally about my experience, (even within all of Britain), because it’s my experience which is in one small area of the country.However, school, for me, was by far the single worst mandatory system I have been exposed to in my life. For the entirety of my young life, school was a prison. With inmates who would beat you, Emotionally abuse you, the “wardens” did not want to be there either, and did not care how the other inmates treated you… sometimes doubling down on the behaviour themselves. - The comparison is further solidified by 6-foot galvanised steel bars surrounding the complex, and that I visited an actual psychiatric prison not long after and the cafeteria, recreational grounds, rooms, etc; were identical to those of my school.Education? You probably mean repeating exercises in rote? You likely mean memorisation? That’s not education.It took becoming an adult to learn for myself that I enjoyed learning. My school was not learning, Everything that got me through school was things that my mother taught me- And as a consequence, I was always top of my class.I find it hard to think of school as anything more than forced internment for children while their parents go to work, with exercises designed to keep you busy more than to give a functional understanding. I would not be surprised if this feeling is shared among many of my generation and social class, the endless chasing of metrics has made even the tiniest amount of joy that could exist in school- Non-existent.and for those saying it was good for socialisation with other children- The ostracised, are learning to be helpless and to be victims- They are not learning to “socialise” more. If anything it is probably more harmful for those people to be exposed to more people until they’ve had time to form on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698737</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of database management systems (DBMS) for businesses and how they help in storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. It highlights the various types of DBMS, such as relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases, and emphasizes the need for organizations to choose the right system based on their specific requirements and use cases. The piece also touches on trends in database technology, including cloud databases and the growing importance of data analytics, underscoring the critical role that databases play in modern data-driven decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I so badly wish we could change a big Windows business application to use PostgreSQL rather than Microsoft SQL Server just because of the licensing costs. 
SQL Server is a fantastic product, but restricted to 128GB RAM and a few CPU cores or you have to start paying so much, that not even our biggest customers can justify it.Migration isn't easy, as this venerable application uses ADO.NET Datasets with TableAdapters and plenty of stored procedures. The syntax is almost compatible though. But not enough unfortunately.For our next product, we're sure to bet on PostgreSQL instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turns out Postgres Is Enough: https://gist.github.com/cpursley/c8fb81fe8a7e5df038158bdfe0f...(Gist contains a bunch of Postgres ecosystems things, if anything is missing, please let me know)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After coming back to coding after ~10-15 years away, databases are IMHO the most improved element of the dev/devops experience.Managed Postgres on Google Cloud is a fantastic product (I'm sure other cloud's offerings are also similarly good). Backups, replication, point-in-time recovery, managed updates, plus quick &amp; easy system &amp; query insight tooling. All for less than £1/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696080</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the release of Shepherd 1.0.0, a service manager designed for the GNU operating system, highlighting its new features and improvements. It discusses enhancements such as improved performance, better support for systemd services, and updated documentation. The release is a significant step towards robustness and usability in managing services, emphasizing the project’s commitment to free software. The blog post also encourages users to try the new version and provides links for downloading and further information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shepherd is a wonderful little service manager. The project has been integrating the good features of systemd (socket activation, timers, etc.) while retaining the hackability of using a fully featured programming language for configuration. Been happily using it with Guix for over a decade!NLnet has funded a really cool project to turn Shepherd into a distributed system that enables a fleet of Shepherds to cooperate. https://nlnet.nl/project/DistributedShepherd/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a quick look at this, the first thing I notice is that the configuration file syntax is obtuse and nigh-illegible unless you already know what things are, and even then it's cumbersome and looks frustrating to write.e.g. instead of systemd's simple:    Exec=/path/to/ntpd -n -c /etc/ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g

We have this mess:    #:start (make-forkexec-constructor
           (list "…/bin/ntpd"
                 "-n" "-c" "/…/…-ntpd.conf" "-u" "ntpd" "-g")
           #:log-file "/var/log/ntpd.log")

They say you don't need to be an expert on guile scheme to build a service file, but it does seem as though you need to know things like what `'(ntpd)` means, which I assumed was some kind of identifier literal, and it seems to be what's called a 'data literal' in scheme, but I had to google to discover that since the actual guile scheme documentation didn't seem to explain that syntax at all.I get that there are benefits to being able to do more advanced scripting in a service file, but this seems like a classic example of programmers writing things for programmers and not for users (or at least, not for users who don't 'get it').Going to chalk this up as another 'GNU reimplemented something badly because of NIH syndrome' incident and move on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that don't know, GNU Shepherd is an init system (like systemd) written in Guile (a LISP), the unit files are written with Guile too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698981</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Rise and Fall of the English Sentence" explores the evolution of English sentence structure, examining how it has changed over the centuries from elaborate constructions to more simplified forms. It discusses the impact of various linguistic influences, the societal shifts affecting language use, and the tension between traditional grammar rules and modern communication styles. Ultimately, the piece reflects on how these changes affect clarity and expression in contemporary writing, suggesting that while language continues to evolve, a balance between innovation and adherence to grammatical standards is essential for effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fun to read letters written by children in the 18th century, as it gives you a little glimpse into what it was like to learn to write at this level of complexity, and what aspects of written language children were being taught to master.Here for example is a letter from John Quincy Adams to his father, written when he was ten:&gt;DEAR SIR,—I love to receive letters very well; much better than I love to write them. I make but a poor figure at composition, my head is too fickle, my thoughts are running after birds eggs play and trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma has a troublesome task to keep me steady, and I own I am ashamed of myself. [...] If I can but keep my resolution, I will write again at the end of the week and give a better account of myself. I wish, Sir, you would give me some instructions, with regard to my time, and advise me how to proportion my Studies and my Play, in writing, and I will keep them by me, and endeavor to follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a present determination of growing better, yours.&gt;P. S.—Sir, if you will be so good as to favor me with a Blank Book, I will transcribe the most remarkable occurances I meet with in my reading, which will serve to fix them upon my mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constructing elegant, deeply nested sentences is an art in English as well as German (my first language).  But it is an art, more for connoisseurs than those who really need to communicate.An art that I appreciate more is at the opposite end.  Constructing elegant prose out of relatively simple sentences, like Ernest Hemingway."He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat."Long sentences for sure, but is there any nesting in there at all?  I can't see any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're confused by the glaring bracket-matching errors in the opening quotation, it is missing two left brackets at the start of the sentence and three right brackets at the end of the sentence. That would correctly balance and nest the bracket pairs and bring the total number of clauses to 8, as described in the first paragraph.I wonder if the missing brackets are an artifact of some weird automated typesetting/rendering or if an editor who never bothered to read the article came through and said, "Quotations shouldn't start and end with random brackets!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695580</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the prompt describing the function call parameters:When calling the automation, you need to provide three main parameters:
 1. Title (title):
A brief descriptive name for the automation. This helps identify it at a glance. For example, "Check for recent news headlines".
 2. Prompt (prompt):
The detailed instruction or request you want the automation to follow. For example:
"Search for the top 10 headlines from multiple sources, ensuring they are published within the last 48 hours, and provide a summary of any recent Russian military strikes in the Lviv Oblast."
 3. Schedule (schedule):
This uses the iCalendar (iCal) VEVENT format to specify when the automation should run. For example, if you want it to run every day at 8:30 AM, you might provide:BEGIN:VEVENT  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTOptionally, you can also include:
 • DTSTART (start time):
If you have a specific starting point, you can include it. For example:BEGIN:VEVENT  
DTSTART:20250115T083000  
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30;BYSECOND=0  
END:VEVENTIn summary, the call typically includes:
 • title (string): A short name.
 • prompt (string): What you want the automation to do.
 • schedule (string): The iCal VEVENT defining when it should run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon had an insane number of people working on just the alarms feature in Alexa when they interviewed me for a position years ago. They had entire teams devoted to the tiniest edge case within the realm of scheduling things with Alexa. This is no doubt one of the biggest use cases in computing: getting your computer to tell you what to do at a given time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The beta is inconsistently showing (required a few refreshes to get something to show up), but my limited usage of it showed a plethora of issues:- Assumed UTC instead of EST. Corrected it and it still continued to bork- Added random time deltas to my asked times (+2, -10 min).- Couple notifications didn't go off at all- The one that did go off didn't provide a push notification.---On top of that, only usable without search mode. In search mode, it was totally confused and gave me a Forbes article.Seems half baked to me.Doing scheduled research behind the scenes or sending a push notification to my phone would be cool, but surprised they thought this was OK for a public beta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704795</guid></item><item><title>43.

Ironically, it felt easier at my previous job as employee in a startup: work during office hours, open-source on the side.Now I spend my free time playing my Fender and exploring ways to combine music with programming, maybe using LLMs for copilot performances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello, and thank you for creating Glicol—it’s an outstanding tool for live coding and audio synthesis!I was wondering about the possibility of extending Glicol’s functionality to include features such as:TTS Emotional Replication
Generating human-like emotional expressions in sound (e.g., sighs, coughs, gasps).
Sound Effects Simulation
Creating realistic environmental sounds, such as thunder, rain, wind, and other ambient effects.
Novel Sound Creation
Enabling the generation of entirely new and experimental sounds, potentially by training on a provided audio dataset.
Given Glicol’s modular architecture, Rust-based engine, and WebAssembly (WASM) support, I’m curious whether it would be theoretically possible to support such extensions within the current framework.Questions
Are any of these features currently possible with Glicol?
If not, are there any plans or ongoing developments to enable functionality like this in the future?
I believe these additions could expand Glicol’s applications far beyond music generation, opening up exciting possibilities in areas like:TTS systems with nuanced emotional expression.
Sound design for games, films, and interactive media.
Experimental audio research and creative sound exploration.
Before concluding, I’d like to add that Glicol’s potential use cases could extend well beyond music generation, offering new opportunities for innovation in audio-based applications.I’d love to hear your thoughts on this and whether these ideas align with Glicol’s future vision. Thank you for your time and for developing such an inspiring platform!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660619</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of stigmergy, a mechanism of indirect communication and coordination observed in social insects like ants, and how this principle could improve programming practices and software development. It argues that, unlike ants, programmers often lack the ability to effectively collaborate and self-organize in a way that enhances productivity and innovation. By integrating aspects of stigmergy into programming methodologies, the author suggests that developers can create more robust systems and collaborate more efficiently, ultimately leading to better outcomes in software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sites down, but do ants have standups every day just to tell the team what they are doing?  Are they forced to attend scrum ceremonies?  Do they have a scrum master insisting they set an arbitrary "sprint goal" every two weeks that everyone, including the scrum master, is going to forget about but management will frown at when they realize we didn't work towards?  Oh, I'd love to be able to produce like an ant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm personally attracted to this way of thinking. I did write a post about it many years ago, probably triggered by this article:https://ole-laursen.blogspot.com/2016/01/stimergy.htmlPart of the mindset is that when you see a co-worker end up in the wrong place with some new code, you ask yourself, can I do something to our code base to lower the probability of it happening again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Why Can't Programmers Be More Like Ants?Because ants dont have business units. Most of us, programmers, are slaves to the business and we have to do what they want from us, not what we want or think is optimal to do. And the requirements can change often. How fast those changes would be notified by others in decentralized "ants approach"? Would the business survive with this approach?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673465</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of specific urban design choices on pedestrian safety, particularly in college towns. It highlights how certain intersections can become hazardous due to poor planning, lack of proper signage, ineffective traffic signals, or other structural issues. The piece emphasizes the need for better urban infrastructure to protect vulnerable road users, advocating for community involvement and policy changes to create safer environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a pedestrian I will take a busy light controlled intersection with a pedestrian scramble type walk signal over a busy 4-way stop where every single time.With the 4-way stop there is never a time in the cycle when all traffic is stopped.  The drivers who are present are continuously paying attention to what other drivers are doing which robs them of situational awareness to note pedestrians.  You can try and time it but that's risky.  With the walk signal there is a brief moment in time when the drivers are doing nothing but waiting for you and are all stopped so you as a pedestrian can account for them in preparation just before you get your signal and make your move.The author can get lost with this sort of textbook correct but questionable in reality take.  Legally having the right of way doesn't make you any less dead when the driver who's got three other drivers to pay attention to doesn't see you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I captured two drivers ripping through red lights in that short spanVideo actually shows two cars entering the intersection on yellow lights, which is legal. The rest of the article seems similarly exaggerated.----Edit: For those who disagree, please be aware that the stop lines are out of frame, so both cars are already in the intersection before they're visible on the video. You can get a better picture of what the intersection actually looks like here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/L37hZyvXs8BeWmFE8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a solved problem and it's astonishing the world hasn't just adopted the Dutch traffic engineering standards outright. It's FASTER for cars and safer for people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42698557</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what I call meta advice.He makes most of the money now from persuading others starting a passive income side gig, for which he coincidentally has a starter pack to sale.  While this might be a reliable income, it is in no means a template for other people to start a successful passive income business with a working business idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an off-the-cuff summary:First you have to make space in your life for it. You need long blocks of time for deep work.The first idea you pick is unlikely to work, so pick something and start moving. Many of the best products come out of working on something else.When building, optimize for speed. Try to get something out in the world as quickly as possible and iterate from there.Pick a tech stack you're familiar with, that you'll be fastest in.Try to spend half your time on marketing/sales, even if you hate it.The most important skill you can have is resiliance. Not giving up is the best path to success. This is hard because there is so much uncertainty in this career path.It's worth it! The autonomy and freedom are unmatched by any other career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When my life was falling apart and I was trying to fix my relationship with my ex she dictated that we spend 'quality' time together which meant watching horrible reality TV while she was on insta on her phone.Out of mind numbing boredom I made a system for SEO spam websites during this time. I would take expiring domain names (so names someone had gone to the trouble to research but been unable to make work) parse out keywords and lookup popularity for them, lookup ad rates for them, and spit out names to buy and make a SEO spam site for (goal was 300 websites making $1 a day or $100k a year), or good names to domain squat. If a domain turned out bunk I threw my link-spam-network software on it to provide linkbacks to my money/new sites. I made around 30k profit a year plus another $5k selling domain names doing this before life fell further apart and it rotted on the vine. I was really tempted to sell it as a package but could never bring myself that low even deep in addiction. Plus Google started cracking down on that trash.I still think the concept of 300 somethings (though please not SEO spam) that make a dollar a day is viable for us here though because we're in the unique position where the creation/maintenance is just a matter of our spare time since we can do the specs/design/coding/administration/maintenance/etc ourselves. It seems like there are still people doing this. Look at new car model forums. Everytime a new car models is released there's a rush to create discussion forums for that model with people hoping Google blesses theirs so they can add it to their portfolio of money maker car model forums. Maybe the secret sauce is forcing yourself to watch reality TV until your mind rebels and says 'fine, grab me the laptop and we'll make mind numbingly boring software products as that is at least better than watching this'.Edit: To clarify this wasn't my income source this was just what I did while being forced to watch 'The Kardashians' for bonding time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42696822</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is refreshing in its research and writing: the research is crude, testing just a very few alternatives - just enough for something to write about. And that's okay, this is not a scientific paper. And then the author collects a few quotes and does not dilute things too much. Good job.I propose another workaround alternative that doesn't exist yet. A "multi-browser" which lets you browse and visually diff the web from different points of view. See the web from deep china, europe, Kansas City, San Francisco, Chrome, Firefox, daytime and nighttime, incognito, logged-in, etc all at once (modulo some time spreading for opsec or something) so we can get back to peace and what matters: booking a bloody hotel room or reading a magazine article without making a project of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic pricing is the future of everything. If consumers are willing to pay 1.5x, you are leaving money on the table by only charging x. In fact in a fully optimized system, once consumers have all of their wants and needs met, they will have zero dollars left over. (Expensive end of life care tends to have similar results today.)NPR did a piece on it last year which to me came off a bit too cheerful.https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1197958433/dynamic-pricing-gr...Using only time of day is fairly primitive, though. We can do better. With facial recognition, we can probably personalize prices to the penny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My wife and I travel a lot as a hobby.

I would even go farther and say that almost everything is automatable depending on how much effort you're willing to put into it. However, lots of bad or overwhelmed devops shops I've consulted seem to be stuck in this insane hell-loop of manual processes not ever giving them "time" or "priority" to automate some of these processes and get them off the treadmill. Usually it takes a fair amount of heroics to get out of that, but I have  specific approach to such situations that I've been using successfully for a few years now.it's always important to remember "devops" is a completely loaded term that can mean drastically different things depending on organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682660</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains why the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, operates over a very short range. It discusses the role of W and Z bosons, which mediate this force and are responsible for processes like beta decay. The article attributes the short-range characteristic to the large mass of these bosons compared to other particles, which results in a rapid decrease in force strength at distances greater than the size of atomic nuclei. The piece also highlights the implications of this force in particle physics and its importance in understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this "explanation" just shift the question to what is stiffness?  Like it refactored the question but didn't actually explain it.Previously, we had statement "the weak force is short range".  In order to explain it, we had to invent a new concept "stiffness" that is treated as a primitive and not explained in terms of other easy primitives, and then we get to "accurately" say that the weak force is short due to stiffness.I grant the OP that stiffness might be hard to explain, but then why not just say "the weak force is short range -- and just take that as an axiom for now".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes me skeptical here is that the author claims that fields have a property that is necessary to explain this, and yet physicists have not given that property a name, so he has to invent one (“stiffness”). If the quantity appears in equations, I find it hard to believe that it was never given a name. Can anyone in the field of physics elucidate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting video essay by the Huygens Optics channel where some simulations of these field effects are considered.Turning Waves Into Particles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP5Pbx8I4sAnd if unfamiliar, that channel constantly delivers high quality thought provoking content on the nature of light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42669906</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the outcome of operations performed on the plaintext. The website discusses its significance in preserving data privacy while enabling the processing of sensitive information, highlighting its applications in cloud computing, healthcare, and finance. It also covers the different types of homomorphic encryption, such as partially, somewhat, and fully homomorphic encryption, along with the challenges and ongoing research in enhancing its efficiency and practicality for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

You want to make search work like magic in the Photos app, so the user can find all their “dog” pictures with ease.What if you're a user and you don't care about searching for "dog" in your own photos, you might not even use the Photos app, but apple still scans all your photos and sends data off device without asking you?Perhaps this complicated dance works, perhaps they have made no mistakes, perhaps no one hacks or coerces the relay host providers... they could still have just asked for consent the first time you open Photos (if you ever do) before starting the scan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its using Concrete from Zama.I didn't like their license because it's BSD-3-Clause-Clear but then they state:"Zama’s libraries are free to use under the BSD 3-Clause Clear license only for development, research, prototyping, and experimentation purposes. However, for any commercial use of Zama's open source code, companies must purchase Zama’s commercial patent license"So Its not free, you need to pay for patent license, and they don't disclose how much.I recommend OpenFHE as an alternative Free open source solution. 
I know its C++ and not Rust, but no patent license and it can do the same thing the blog post wants to do, it even has more features like proxy-reencryption that I think Concrete can't do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;     The two hops, the two companies, are already acting in partnership, so what is there technically in the relay setup to stop the two companies from getting together—either voluntarily or at the secret command of some government—to compare notes, as it were, and connect the dots?The OHTTP scheme does not _technically_ prevent this.
It increases the number parties need to cooperate to extract this information, hoping it would be caught somewhere in the pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666959</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against the use of cosine similarity as a measure for comparing documents or vectors in machine learning and natural language processing. It highlights inherent flaws in the metric that can lead to misleading interpretations, especially when dealing with sparse data or high-dimensional spaces. The author suggests that alternatives like Euclidean distance or more context-aware techniques should be considered to better capture the nuances in data comparisons, ultimately aiming for more accurate and meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're using cosine similarity when retrieving for a RAG application, a good approach is to then use a "semantic re-ranker" or "L2 re-ranking model" to re-rank the results to better match the user query.There's an example in the pgvector-python that uses a cross-encoder model for re-ranking: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/exam...You can even use a language model for re-ranking, though it may not be as good as a model trained specifically for re-ranking purposes.In our Azure RAG approaches, we use the AI Search semantic ranker, which uses the same model that Bing uses for re-ranking search results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In the US, word2vec might tell you espresso and cappuccino are practically identical. It is not a claim you would make in Italy.True, and quite funny. This is an excellent, well-written and very informative article, but this part is wrongly worded:&gt; Let's have a task that looks simple, a simple quest from our everyday life: "What did I do with my keys?" [and compare it to other notes using cosine similarity]: "Where did I put my wallet" [=&gt; 0.6], "I left them in my pocket" [=&gt; 0.5]&gt; The best approach is to directly use LLM query to compare two entries, [along the lines of]: "Is {sentence_a} similar to {sentence_b}?"(bits in brackets paraphrased for quoting convenience)This will result in the same, or "worse" result, as any LLM will respond that "Where did I put my wallet" is very similar to "What did I do with my keys?", while "I left them in my pocket" is completely dissimilar.I'm actually not sure what the author was trying to get at here? You could ask an LLM 'is that sentence a plausible answer to the question' and then it would work; but if you ask for pure 'likeness', it seems that in many cases, LLMs' responses will be close to cosine similarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So word vectors solve the problem that two words may never appear in the same context, yet can be strongly correlated. "Python" may never be found close to "Ruby", yet "scripting" is likely to be found in both their contexts so the embedding algorithm will ensure that they are close in some vector space. Except it rarely works well because of the curse of dimensionality.Perhaps one could represent word embeddings as vertices, rather than vectors? Suppose you find "Python" and "scripting" in the same context. You draw a weighted edge between them. If you find the same words again you reduce the weight of the edge. Then to compute the similarity between two words, just compute the weighted shortest path between their vertices. You could extend it to pair-wise sentence similarity using Steiner trees. Of course it would be much slower than cosine similarity, but probably also much more useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the generous free tier offered by Cloudflare Pages, highlighting its strategic purpose in attracting developers and fostering a community of users. It explains that this approach not only allows developers to build and deploy projects without initial costs but also encourages them to adopt more advanced features as their needs grow. The piece emphasizes the long-term benefits for Cloudflare, as happy users are likely to convert to paid plans, enhancing customer loyalty and driving revenue growth for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Additionally, there's plenty of "Upgrade to Pro" buttons sprinkled about. It's the freemium model at work.I don't think they care much about few "Pro" upgrades here and there. The real money, and their focus as a company, is in enterprise contracts. Note that, Matthew Prince, the CEO, had outlined a few reasons why they have such a generous free tier on an Stack Exchange answer[1]. I think the biggest reason is this:&gt; Bandwidth Chicken &amp; Egg: in order to get the unit economics around bandwidth to offer competitive pricing at acceptable margins you need to have scale, but in order to get scale from paying users you need competitive pricing. Free customers early on helped us solve this chicken &amp; egg problem. Today we continue to see that benefit in regions where our diversity of customers helps convince regional telecoms to peer with us locally, continuing to drive down our unit costs of bandwidth.Cloudflare had decided long ago that they wanted to work at an incredible scale. I would actually be very interested in understanding how this vision came to be. Hope Matthew writes that book someday.[1]: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/88685.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not really free. One day, you get a call from their sales team saying "you're straining our network". I kid you not. We were on a business plan and still got this. When we met them in person, we were asked to upgrade to a $2000+ per month plan. From a $200/mo plan. That's a 10x increase. I searched their TOS, nowhere it was mentioned about "straining their network". Turns out that's just their scammy tactic to get you to pay. We refused. That really left a bad taste in my mouth.Today, I refuse to recommend any client or startup to them because of this extremely unethical practice. All around, I'm not sure they deserve so much positive press/attention, especially after screwing some of their own employees (one even got super famous live streaming the firing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh boy, where to start..&gt; So why is Cloudflare Pages' bandwidth unlimited?&gt; Why indeed. Strategically, Cloudflare offering unlimited bandwidth for small static sites like mine fits in with its other benevolent servicesThose are not "benevolent". Seeing a substantial amount of name resolutions of the internet is a huge and unique asset that greatly benefits their business.&gt; like 1.1.1.1 (that domain lol)It's an IP address, not a domain. And they paid a lot of money for that "lol", so that people have an easy time remembering it. Just like Google with 8.8.8.8. Not to be benevolent, but to minimize the threshold for you to give them your data.&gt; Second, companies like Cloudflare benefit from a fast, secure internet.It's the exact opposite. The less secure the internet, the more people buy Cloudflare's services. In a perfectly secure intetnet, nobody would need Cloudflare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712433</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The movie, Rebel Ridge, does a decent job showing just how bad this can be in a small town. It's not exactly realistic for how the former Marine depicted chose to try to resolve the situation... It does give room to consider just how corrupt it can all be. Consider if you live in a town with only one bank. 
Clearly the bank and the police have a relationship and in a small town, odds are they all know each other quite well. Say someone withdraws money from the bank. Then the teller sort of rats you out to law enforcement or someone adjacent to law enforcement. They manufacture an excuse to pull you over just as was done in this Nevada story. The movie Rebel Ridge goes into the difficulty in even getting your money back in the first place. At one point they explain a large part of the police departments funding comes from this. Then again, it isn't just small police departments getting kick backs, it's everyone involved to run up the cost for someone who had their money stolen.At some point, civil forfeiture laws will lay the foundation for having any amount of cash being a sort of assumption of criminality. Consider too that smaller banks and even large banks have reserve requirements but not enough to cover all of the deposits. When most money exists in digital form in a database somewhere, over time, the concept of real paper money gets that assumption of wrong doing. Almost like it is the financial equivalent of "you must have something to hide, or else you would be using your credit card".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US legal system (unlike some other countries) is built on the presumption of innocence. Civil forfeiture completely contravenes that principle and is therefore essentially extortion and corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  18 U.S. Code § 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the Lambda architecture, which is a framework for building robust and scalable data processing systems. It outlines the main components of the architecture, including the batch layer, speed layer, and serving layer, emphasizing their roles in handling large volumes of data and providing real-time analytics. The site provides insights into the benefits and challenges of implementing Lambda architecture, as well as practical examples and considerations for developers looking to adopt this approach in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been attracted to this - along with 2D cellular automata - a bit like a moth to a flame for some time. I find the little machine visualisations mesmerising, the heavily parenthesized Greek representation charming (they look like standing orders written in an alien language, looking for all the world like space invaders) and the tiny code sizes magical.But I can't quite wrap my mind around the core concepts and internalize them into a mental model. It's too different from the simple world of imperative C or scripting languages I guess I call home. So I'm left watching das blinkenlights from the outside, as my attention span chokes on the layers of computer science incorporated into typical explanations. *shrug*I'd be very interested if anyone knows of an ELI5-style alternate path I could walk to break each of the concepts down one at a time. (I ask because I think this is (currently) the kind of thing I think ChatGPT would struggle to present as effectively as a human.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. If anyone wants to see an example of an awesome program you can run on the 520 byte version of my lambda calculus virtual machine (Blc) then check out https://github.com/woodrush/lambdalisp If you run the command in that project, it'll download my VM from the blog post, build a 20kb lambda expression you can pipe into it, and BOOM a fully object-oriented LISP REPL will appear in your terminal. It's like magic. For an example expression, try typing (+ 2 3) and hit enter. Then type (let ((a 2) (b 3)) (+ a b)) and hit enter. You need an x86 linux machine to do this right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;nine="λλ [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 [1 0]]]]]]]]]"Looks like Brainfuck in disguise :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679191</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Nobody Cares" by Grant Slatton explores the theme of personal responsibility and self-determination in the face of life's challenges. Slatton emphasizes that while external support is valuable, ultimately, individuals must take charge of their own lives and decisions. He argues against the victim mentality and encourages readers to adopt a proactive mindset, focusing on their goals and actions rather than seeking validation from others. The piece serves as a motivational call to embrace accountability and drive personal change.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its ironic, because this dude doesn't seem to care enough to even the slightest bit of research to understand why any of these problems he highlights are the way they are, and lazily attributes everything to OTHER people not caring. LEDs last longer, are more energy efficient, and also reduce light pollution because they are more directional[1]. Took me 30 seconds to google. There are enormous design standards for designing bike lanes[2]. It is almost certainly the case the design of this intersection is dictated by these standards. But sure, just assume it's because everyone is stupid.[1] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/streetlights-are-...
[2] https://streetsillustrated.seattle.gov/design-standards/bicy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that depresses me is how ugly our cities have become. Buildings that go up are designed with a total lack of aesthetic intention. In Seattle, ostensibly there is a design review committee for multifamily and commercial buildings, but it doesn't appear to have made the city look any better, and their 2025 goals include "streamlining the Design Review process to be quicker and less costly for applicants, and reducing the number of projects that are required to go through Design Review."This is the committee that's supposed to care about this, and they don't. And the architects don't because they're not being paid to make a beautiful façade. And the developers don't because they want to finish construction as quickly and cheaply as possible. And the residents of the city don't care because they're apathetic about living in a beautiful environment.What kills me though is that we travel to landmarks in New York City or Florence or wherever, and gawk at the beautifully-designed old buildings and charming plazas, and seem to lack the recognition that we could live in places just as beautiful if somebody cared.It doesn't really have to cost much more. I used to live in a 20th century building originally built as a schoolhouse. The city architect, who was budget-constrained, still made a point of including decorative brickwork. 120 years later it was by far the most attractive building on the street.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The McDonald's touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.I was working in this space! And I got fired for refusing to work on more upsell features for clients like Coca Cola and such.I don't want to work on adding fucking ADS into checkout.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to ban Red Dye No. 3, a food coloring linked to cancer, which gained attention due to advocacy from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The ban reflects ongoing concerns about the safety of food additives and the growing scrutiny over chemicals in the food supply. The article outlines the potential implications of this decision for food manufacturers and consumers, noting the history of the dye's use and previous regulatory actions surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact - this is how blue raspberry was created as a flavor. Raspberry flavored things were purple, made from a combination of red and blue dye. The red dye (red no 2) was banned. So companies making raspberry flavored stuff just left the red dye out and said "raspberry is blue now" and we all went "shit yeah it is, always has been! why would raspberry be anything other than blue?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the CNN article:&gt; There don’t appear to be any studies establishing links between red dye No. 3 and cancer in humans, and “relevant exposure levels to FD&amp;C Red No. 3 for humans are typically much lower than those that cause the effects shown in male rats,” the FDA said in its constituent update posted Wednesday. “Claims that the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 3 in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.”&gt; But “it doesn’t matter, because the FDA mandate under the Delaney Clause says that if it shows cancer in animals or humans, they’re supposed to keep it from the food supply,” said Dr. Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.Even more confusing - the FDA still doesn't believe there's a cancer link with humans. But they are banning it anyway on a technicality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comparison between American and Canadian Froot Loop cereal is illuminating:https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/uc265y/a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711556</guid></item><item><title>12.

These are just pieces of metal, U-channel, L-channel, or solid bar, to add some structural strength. Cheap and easy, but rarely seen in hobbyist work. Any board with buttons or knobs or connectors unsupported for more than a few inches should have some stiffening. You have to allow space for stiffening bars when designing the board, and you need to place screw holes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42672366</guid></item><item><title>13.

Ropey uses unsafe code to help achieve some of its space and performance characteristics.

If you find any unsoundness, please file an issue! Also welcome are recommendations for how to remove any of the unsafe code without introducing significant space or performance regressions, or how to compartmentalize the unsafe code even better."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust is missing an abstraction over non-contiguous chunks of contiguous allocations of data that would make handling ropes seamless and more natural even for smaller sizes.C# has the concept of “Sequences” which is basically a generalization of a deque with associated classes and apis such as ReadOnlySequence and SequenceReader to encourage reduced allocations, reuse of existing buffers/slices even for composition, etcKnowing the rust community, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s already an RFC for something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hadn't heard of rope data structures until I read about the xi editor (also written in Rust) a few years ago, but it looks like that's been discontinued.https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711966</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing backlash in Sweden regarding the heavy reliance on digital education tools in schools, particularly in reading and writing instruction. Educators and parents express concerns that digital platforms hinder traditional literacy skills, as children become increasingly adept at using technology but struggle with fundamental reading and writing. Critics argue that while digital tools can enhance learning experiences, they should not replace traditional methods. The debate highlights the need for a balanced approach in education that incorporates both digital resources and conventional teaching techniques to ensure students develop essential literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Into notes in Obsidian, that I can link to in my study notes.Recently I started buying paper based books again. Man, I missed holding physical books in my hands. And I start to regret having gotten rid of my physical library. There were so many memories I had with most of these books. I remember their covers, and instantly my emotions , thoughts, feelings are triggered. I don’t have these emotions when I think of my digital books.My spouse has books that she was gifted when she was a child. Still in our kids shelf. I cannot give her my digital books.I regret the decision having gone fully digital, which can only be a complement to physical books.Printed books are a physical experience. Something that allows me to attach thoughts, emotions, feelings to it. And they can become part of my life. Like a good friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I definitely agree that just giving kids a laptop/chromebook instead of books is not working.  My own child and her friends just don't have the focus required, and easily get distracted out to email, group chats, everything else going on right next to the text.That said, one thing I appreciate is that she doesn't have to lug around 30lb backpacks like kids did when I was a child.  We had lockers, but realistically they didn't provide adequate time to utilize them, so everyone just carried around all their books for the day.  Most of us hunched forward because of the weight.It seems like something like a dumb ereader would be a good middle ground?  Put all the textbooks into one place, but don't give it the ability to do anything but read?  That or keep the textbooks in the classroom and share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm unclear if this is a real article.It claims to be published in 2025 but it refers to 2022-2025 in the future tense.&gt; [...] Sweden’s putting 104 million euros into bringing books back into classrooms from 2022 to 2025See the comment identifying a legitimate source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716448&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715841</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide for Django developers on how to effectively integrate modern JavaScript into their web applications. It discusses key JavaScript concepts and frameworks, such as ES6 features, asynchronous programming, and popular libraries like React and Vue.js. The guide emphasizes the importance of using JavaScript to enhance user interfaces and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, it covers best practices for setting up a development environment, managing dependencies, and optimizing performance, helping Django developers to leverage the power of modern JavaScript in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent article, and SaaS Pegasus is a great solution for people starting a project.But some of the advice here is dated. The architectural patterns are still valid, but the specifics have changed:* Vite instead of create-react-app (which is unmaintained now) / webpack / babel /  Parcel / etc.* Django-ninja as a lightweight API service.I think these are important to call out because they really simplify the frontend compared to the previous options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having used HTMX and Unpoly with Django, for over 2 years now, I prefer using Unpoly more these days.Unpoly feels just like Django, it is a more of a framework than a thin layer, but that means it comes with a lot of productive features built-in, albeit opinionated.It covers 95% of the use-cases of a typical web app, with its layers and forms concepts. E.g. I love creating "subinteractions" with unpoly, where a complex process can be divided into smaller modal forms for creating the "related" objects of a model, which then updates the main form of the model itself. Unpoly makes these simple, and its documentation caters for exactly these scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've tried several boilerplates like SaaSPegasus and one thing I can't really get around is that I feel like the experience of developing in a docker-compose with two build-and-serve containers (e.g. one with gunicorn auto-reload and the other running something like esbuild for the frontend) is very clunky in VSCode?I feel like I'm doing something crazy, this must be a problem many other people have, but things like language server integration on the JS and Python side separately do not mesh well.If anyone sees this and has a minimal open source boilerplate to recommend I'd love to try it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711387</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for converting ePub files into audiobook formats. It outlines the necessary tools and steps, including using Python scripts to extract text and convert it into speech, which can then be saved as audio files. The process is aimed at helping users who prefer listening to books rather than reading them, providing a practical solution for creating audiobooks from existing ePub content. The article is particularly beneficial for those interested in technology and audio processing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, this is very convenient. Probably cool for some non-fiction.On the other, some of my favorite audio books all stood out because the narrator was interpreting the text really well, for example by changing the pacing during chaotic moments. Or those audiobooks with multiple narrators and different voices for each character. Not to mention that sometimes the only cue you get for who's speaking during dialogue is how the voice actor changes their tone. I have mixed feelings about using this and losing some of that quality.I would totally use this over amateur ebooks or public domain audiobooks like the ones on project guttenberg. As cool as it is/was for someone to contribute to free books... as a listener it was always jarring to switch to a new chapter and hear a completely different voice and microphone quality for no reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality is great (amazing even), but I can't listen to AI generated voices for more than 1 minute. 
I don't know why, I just don't like it. 
I immediately skip the video on youtube if the voice is AI generated.Might be because our brains try to 'feel' the speaker, the emotion, the pauses, the invisible smile, etc.No doubt models will improve and will be harder to identify as AI generated, but for now, as with diffusion images, I still notice it and react by just moving on..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone recommend an open source option that would allow training on a custom voice (my own, so I'd be able to record as many snippets as it needed to train on) to allow me to use it for TTS generation without sharing it off my machine?Edit: I'll wait to see if any recommendations get made here, if not I might give this one a go: https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708773</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything else aside, this is an absolutely fantastic development and I really hope the ceasefire holds and all hostages are released.I just fear this will cause western media and politicians to and declare the crisis to be over (after it had began on Oct. 7, of course absolutely out of the blue and without any context...) and go back to pretending everything is back to normal. Never mind that Gaza is still in ruins, the west bank is still being annexed, Israel still has the dual role of "all authority, no obligations" over the Palestinians, while  making it pretty clear they have no vision for them at all, apart from "maybe they just vanish into thin air tomorrow".And never mind that Israel still has a fundamentalist, authoritarian government that is actively at work undermining democratic structures and civil rights even inside the state - that too with no word of objection from its allies.We'll see where all of that goes.I also found Trump's signalling in the whole issue odd. His base and his cabinet is full of the most hard-line pro-israel figures imaginable, but then he goes forward and quotes Jeffrey Sachs and ostensibly pressures Netanyahu into accepting the ceasefire.Is this just his usual "appear unpredictable by all means" spiel or does he have a strategy there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamas was offered a ceasefire under exactly the same terms in May, and refused it. Since then:* Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Hamas political wing, was killed in Tehran* Yahyah Sinwar, the leader of the Al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in Gaza* Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah, was killed in Beirut* Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, was killed a week later* Large swathes of Hezbollah's command and control were wiped out in the pager attack* Bashar al-Assad, Iran's most important military client, fled SyriaThe Al-Qassam Brigades are shattered. Mohammad Sinwar, its current leader, is reported by ISW not to have communications with most of its new recruits, who are scavenging improvised weapons from unexploded ordinance. Iran's "Axis of Resistance" lies in tatters, their foreign/military strategy, of which Hamas was a key component, now seems totally repudiated. Hamas has lost most of its remaining infrastructure, supply chains, and support.They should have taken the deal when it was first offered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I suppose it's just back to the status quo? What has really changed that will make a difference in 2-3 years from now? Israel has sowed a whole fresh generation of "I will sacrifice everything to wipe Israel" Palestinian youth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716440</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Google has announced that it will be offering free AI features in Google Workspace, aimed at enhancing productivity for users. This includes features like automated writing suggestions, smart scheduling, and improved collaboration tools. The initiative is designed to make Workspace more accessible and competitive, enabling users to leverage AI capabilities without incurring additional costs. As part of its commitment to innovation, Google is focusing on integrating these advanced functionalities seamlessly within its existing suite of productivity tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Workspace AI includes things like email summaries in Gmail, generated designs for spreadsheets and videos, an automated note-taker for meetings, the powerful NotebookLM research assistant, and writing tools across apps.Maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon stuck in my ways, but I haven't found much compelling value in these use cases in my day-to-day work. For summaries and note-taking specifically, I feel they're solving the wrong problem: it's not that I have all this information that I really want to go through, but it's that I have too much information and it's become all noise.The real solution to too much email is fewer and higher-priority emails. The real solution to too many meetings is fewer and more-focused meetings. These tools paper over the root cause of the problem, which is that people/organizations cannot (or are unwilling to) be clear about communication priorities and say "maybe this email/meeting isn't a good use of time after all."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw a Google AI advert that said:"Hey Gemini, write an apology email for my friend. I can't make their wedding."That's not a future I want to live in, and I love making machines work for me.Thats not what I want my children to think is OK.A friend of mine is a teacher and kids are already delegating their learning to ChatGPT and their learning isn't sticking.What happens when social skills are delegated too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pay for 3 Workspace orgs, and I have Gemini disabled (or still not enabled) on all 3 of them. I'm angry that I'll have to pay more for features I don't use. Gemini should be an add-on cost, not included in the base costIf they're raising the price of personal GMail, I don't have a problem. But Workspace with hundreds of users, now that's a problem, because it actually hurts my wallet significantly. When this increase comes, I'll have to move elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710978</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Transformer Squared, an innovative model in the field of machine learning that enhances the capabilities of traditional transformer architectures. It introduces a new technique that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of neural networks in natural language processing by leveraging adaptive attention mechanisms and incorporating a two-dimensional structure for data representation. The model aims to address common challenges in processing large datasets while maintaining high performance, ultimately offering promising solutions for various applications in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One weakness of this method is the storage of decomposed UV from W. My linear algebra is rusty, but it seems required if you want to scale in that U projected subspace, hence double your weight memory footprint (that has been said, U / V should be easier to quantize from information theory perspective). I also think MoE is more principled if you want to have experts activations. But I understand that Sakana's research focus mostly is about adapting existing pretrained models, not to do it from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like MoE and maybe a bit of chain-of-thought. Curious what someone with more domain expertise thinks about thisIf they can test against Llama 70B and Mistral 7B, they ought to compare against Mistral 8x7b imho&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great research here. Contextual real-time weight modification is definitely one of the breakthroughs required for AGI. Why create a LoRA when you can generate one on the fly suited to the task at hand?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705935</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you care fairness, I have 1 extra suggestion that you might be interested in.It was proven by several data-science research that when users have to votes (or give ratings) and if they are able to see the previous result, then the first few votes have an extremely important effect.For instance here is one stury, very well written article by a famous teacher Robert West, "of sheep and beer" https://dlab.epfl.ch/2017-08-30-of-sheep-and-beer/ which describes this effect on beer-rating sites.One way to overcome this effect is to hide the votes until enough votes were collected (eg more than 50). Another way is to hide votes until you have voted yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking cool! I have two questions though:&gt;10 launches per day, max.What if your launch queue will be filling at a much faster rate aka backpressure issue? E.g what if this went viral and you get 1000 new projects per day, any new launch is scheduled after three months then?&gt;2 votes per user, per day.Any idea how to prevent someone from creating 10 fake accounts and making it 20 votes per day? I'm sure any entrepreneur will see this opportunity right away if a little cheating means more exposure.Looks like a good alternative to product hunt, the UI is looking fresh and I like it, however I'm genuinely interested about your thoughts on the problems this model can have at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Ryan Hoover would take back the integrity of Product Hunt. It's such an amazing product with such currently painful execution, assumingly in the name of site traffic traded for ad dollars.I truly think that the conversion rate for advertisers on PH would go UP if the quality of the site (moderated posts, comments, bot traffic) did the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712666</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;Pyper is a Python package designed to facilitate communication between Python and R. It allows users to run R scripts from Python, retrieve R objects into Python, and provides a simple interface for data exchange. This integration is particularly useful for leveraging R's statistical capabilities and extensive libraries alongside Python's versatility. The package is easy to install and works across different operating systems, making it accessible for data scientists and analysts who wish to combine the strengths of both programming languages in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work! There is a gap when it comes to writing single-machine, concurrent CPU-bound python code. Ray is too big, pykka is threads only, builtins are poorly abstracted. The syntax is also very nice!But I'm not sure I can use this even though I have a specific use-case that feels like it would work well (high-performance pure Python downloading from cloud object storage). The examples are a bit too simple and I don't understand how I can do more complicated things.I chunk up my work, run it in parallel and then I need to do a fan-in step to reduce my chunks - how do you do that in Pyper?Can the processes have state? Pure functions are nice, but if I'm reaching for multiprocess, I need performance and if I need performance, I'll often want a cache of some sort (I don't want to pickle and re-instantiate a cloud client every time I download some bytes for instance).How do exceptions work? Observability? Logs/prints?Then there's stuff that is probably asking too much from this project, but I get it if I write my own python pipeline so it matters to me - rate limiting WIP, cancellation, progress bars.But if some of these problems are/were solved and it offers an easy way to use multiprocessing in python, I would probably use it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You really should dive more into the `multiprocess` support option and highlight how this gets around issues with the GIL. This feels like a major value add, and "does this help with CPU-bound work" being "yes" is a big deal!I don't really need pipelining that much, but pipelining along with a certain level of durability and easy multiprocessing support? Now we're talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowkey I hate the "\" line continuation in Python to force PEP-8 compliance in a way... Is there any Pythonistas who would write the examples in there differently to achieve a similar level of readability?&gt;    pipeline = task(get_data, branch=True) \&gt;        | task(step1, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step2, workers=20) \&gt;        | task(step3, workers=20, multiprocess=True)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673273</guid></item><item><title>22.

I'm guessing this is the intended meaning of the term in the name. When most decently well informed, native speakers of English hear "simplex," though, they are likely to hear "herpes simplex" and so are likely to wonder, as I did, whether, or why, the program is named after a sexually transmitted disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great demo, straight to the point. It might be nice to have some kind of feedback mechanism if it can't find the element on the page, or if it's partially cut off. For example, I changed the GitHub profile to my own (https://github.com/spro) in the example and it doesn't scroll down far enough for the whole image. I imagine in general it would be nice to scroll to an element ID (or even element description using the vision models) instead of a hardcoded value.Side-note: The comment for the frequency graph is wrong, it mentions stars instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704160</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a really smart idea to try to leverage the inherent scalability of semiconductor photonics. I think the use of a linear optical resonator to amplify a weak optical nonlinearity is quite genius, and something the relatively small nonlinear photonics community has been trying to do forever. That they showed this kind of 'all-optical-ish' nonlinearity on a relatively mature process in a foundry is nothing to scoff at, and likely one of the biggest results in semiconductor photonics in a while. At the single device level I think it makes so much sense, but what concerns me in general is how well this scales from a few perspectives:1. resonators and device-to-device variance: in general it's pretty hard to get these resonant effects to line up with each other from a production POV, especially with large arrays. Silicon photonics has come far, but I don't think it has approached the level of uniformity as electronics. They have demonstrated some level of electro-optic tunability, which is the traditional solution, but they still need to leverage that for their nonlinear effects too.2. area and space: the 'minimum' trace size of these planar photonics circuits is still quite large (~200 nm minimum feature size typically for these waveguides). This is essentially due to a minimum size needed to confine light within a waveguide which depends generally on the waveguide's refractive index and target wavelength. These are currently all integrated on a planar manner, so each channel becomes quite large, especially if now you also need a relatively large ring resonator, which in this case is at least ~100 micrometers or so in diameter3. the combination of 1 and 2: high device-to-device variation, along with a large planar footprint means that these things are quite expensive and difficult to manufacture, without some kind of miniaturization benefit that you would typically get with electronics (at least not yet). This effect appears to be more than the sum of 1 + 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting to see how work in this space is progressing.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how Cerebras Systems has implemented a remarkable 100x defect tolerance in their AI chips to address manufacturing yield issues. It highlights the innovative design and architectural choices made to minimize the impact of defects in the silicon, enabling the production of high-performance chips despite potential flaws. This capability significantly enhances reliability and performance, allowing for the delivery of more powerful computing solutions in AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is an important step, but it skips over that 'fault tolerant routing architecture' means you're spending die space on routes vs transistors. This is exactly analogous to using bits in your storage for error correcting vs storing data.That said, I think they do a great job of exploiting this technique to create a "larger"[1] chip. And like storage it benefits from every core is the same and you don't need to get to every core directly (pin limiting).In the early 2000's I was looking at a wafer scale startup that had the same idea but they were applying it to an FPGA architecture rather than a set of tensor units for LLMs. Nearly the exact same pitch, "we don't have to have all of our GLUs[2] work because the built in routing only uses the ones that are qualified." Xilinx was still aggressively suing people who put SERDES ports on FPGAs so they were pin limited overall but the idea is sound.While I continue to believe that many people are going to collectively lose trillions of dollars ultimately pursuing "AI" at this stage. I appreciate the the amount of money people are willing to put at risk here allow for folks to try these "out of the box" kinds of ideas.[1] It is physically more cores on a single die but the overall system is likely smaller, given the integration here.[2] "Generic Logic Unit" which was kind of an extended LUT with some block RAM and register support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they massively reduce the area lost to defects per wafer, from 361 to 2.2 square mm. But from the figures in this blog, this is massively outweighed by the fact that they only get 46222 sq mm useable area out of the wafer, as opposed to 56247 that the H100 gets - because they are using a single square die instead of filling the circular wafer with smaller square dies, they lose 10,025 sq mm!Not sure how that's a win.Unless the rest of the wafer is useable for some other customer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat. What about power density?An H100 has a TDP of 700 watts (for the SXM5 version). With a die size of 814 mm^2 that's 0.86 W/mm^2. If the cerebras chip has the same power density, that means a cerebras TDP of 37.8 kW.That's a lot. Let's say you cover the whole die area of the chip with water 1 cm deep. How long would it take to boil the water starting from room temperature (20 degrees C)?amount of water = (die area of 46225 mm^2) * (1 cm deep) * (density of water) = 462 gramsenergy needed = (specific heat of water) * (80 kelvin difference) * (462 grams) = 154 kJtime = 154 kJ / 39.8 kW = 3.9 secondsThis thing will boil (!) a centimeter of water in 4 seconds. A typical consumer water cooler radiator would reduce the temperature of the coolant water by only 10-15 C relative to ambient, and wouldn't like it (I presume) if you pass in boiling water. To use water cooling you'd need some extreme flow rate and a big rack of radiators, right? I don't really know. I'm not even sure if that would work. How do you cool a chip at this power density?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717165</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a specific speed sign that warns drivers of a potentially dangerous road situation, particularly in areas where the speed limit changes unexpectedly. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to speed limits and remaining vigilant while driving, especially in regions where accidents are common due to sudden changes in speed regulations. The piece uses graphic examples and expert insights to highlight the correlation between speed and traffic safety, ultimately urging readers to take speed signs seriously to avoid serious accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title and some of the comments assume it would be something like if you take 15 extra minutes you would just die. When in reality it would just be an increase in cancer risk. If it were THAT contaminated they'd use the AREA CLOSED the article mentions anyways.To be fatal within days you need about 10,000 mSv of exposure. Even with heavy fallout, exposure would probably be around 10 mSv per hour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly enough, the Fukushima exclusion zone has roads that pretty much fit the bill. They're the pink lines on this map (PDF), with the exclusion zone in gray:https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/pd...You are permitted to drive through but not stop or get out of your car. I presume ordinary speed limits apply though, so no exciting post-apocalyptic signage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself.THEY STILL DO!!!!This is what drives me nuts about our politics: so many people seem to think we can flirt with the sort of nationalism (1) that led us into WWI and WWII. But, friends, that road leads to your death in every direction. Mutually Assured Destruction is still a thing. Nuclear peace only works as long as all parties persistently work toward de-escalation, which can be measured by adherence to consensus and norms. Nationalism is antithetical to that posture. The iconoclast leaders of national populism are rooted in rulebreaking. They also tend to embrace strong foreign policy talk as a short term bolster to domestic support, again, antithetical to de-escalation.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704491</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new approach for developing a quantum geometric phase in a non-adiabatic context, extending the understanding of geometric phases beyond traditional adiabatic frameworks. It highlights the significance of the quantum geometric phase in various applications, including quantum computing and quantum information science. The research employs theoretical models to demonstrate the conditions under which non-adiabatic geometric phases can be effectively generated and manipulated, ultimately contributing to the foundational knowledge of quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20241223001630/https://iopscienc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a degree in theoretical physics, and also did research on general relativity.The result is cool, but it's not directly applicable to the traditional (sci-fi) scenario "I travel to the past and meet myself / my parents / my ancestors"The reason is simple: the authors suppose a CLOSED timelike curve, i.e. something like a circle, where you travel back in time and BECOME your younger self - which by the way only exists because you traveled back in time in the first place.A slightly different scenario would be much more interesting, but my guess is that it's much harder to analyze:a NEARLY closed timelike curve, which arrives from the past, coils around itself one or more times - like a coil, indeed - allowing causal interaction between the different spires (i.e. one can interact with its future self/selves and with its past self/selves), and finally the last spire leaves toward the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "In the introduction, we stated that, since a CTC is a compact set, there is an event x0 where the entropy of the spaceship is minimal. In the proximity of such event, our macroscopic notion of causation breaks down. This is evident in figures 2 and 3, where the existence of the low-entropy state at proper time 
T does not have any macroscopic cause in its near past or future. It just 'fluctuates into existence'. Indeed, any form of order that the event x0 carries (including objects and people) has no logical cause that can be expressed in purely macroscopic terms. For example, if there is a book, nobody wrote it. If a person has a memory, this memory is illusory, and its content is meaningless (by human standards). This is because our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy [1], and there is no event with lower entropy than x0."I don't believe that "our notions of 'writing' and 'forming a memory' implicitly rely on increasing entropy."  Entropy's relation to the arrow of time is complex but it's enough for entropy to be non-static, and for things to durably exist in the world, for there to be a notion of movement in time.  If something was written at time T, entropy fluctuated into a minimum at T+100, and entropy increased again at T+200, at all points the original writing event would be traceable back to T.Time appears to stop and things become causally disconnected from each other when entropy reaches minima or maxima and stays there.  Even so, local fluctuations can lead to the emergence of an arrow of time -- e.g. if a glucose molecule coalesces out of the void, you can measure time by it, as it's not perfectly stable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677158</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been maintaining my personal website as plain HTML for five years now. I must say, I quite like this method. There's no substitute for practice when it comes to maintaining your skills at editing HTML and CSS.Yes, you must copy and paste content and not having layout page is annoying at times. But the overhead of just doing it yourself is surprisingly small in terms of the time commitment.Typically, I'll draft a post in MS Word then open the git repo for my site, hosted on github pages, duplicate and rename the template.html page that includes the CSS, footer, and header for my site and then copy my content into it. When I'm happy with everything, I'll make my commit and then a minute later it's live at my custom domain. Seeing that it takes only 11KBs and 26ms to load my landing page strangely delightful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot you can do with just plain html these days if you just need a clean site. Here's an example from my recipe site (https://xilic.com/recipia/sauces/pesto_traditional.html), mostly for my personal use or sharing with friends, with only html/css. It has expandable boxes, a menu system, etc. A simple script converts a directory structure of .csv files to these recipe cards with a template, and this way you can edit the sources in a spreadsheet and then the publish script just takes whatever is new and re-does the whole lot of html as necessary. Just like we used to do with Apache Forest!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website of one of the most influential IT person, who won the court battle against U.S. Government, allowing for widespread cryptography, professor Daniel J. Bernstein, is and always has been plain HTML mostly with no CSS.https://cr.yp.to/It's served using his own HTTP server - publicfile, and the DNS domain is served using his own DNS server - djbdns. E-mail is handled using his own SMTP server - qmail. He invented the Maildir e-mail format, de facto standard in all e-mail products. All e-mail mailing lists for his products are handled by his own mailing list server - ezmlm. All of this is managed using his replacements to /etc/rc or /etc/init.d or systemd - daemontools.He invented ChaCha and Salsa stream ciphers, now in widespread use, as well as elliptic curves, especially the famous Curve25519, and the Poly1305 MAC.He also invented TCP SYN cookies.Pretty impressive, no?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705077</guid></item><item><title>28. dnSpyEx: .NET debugger and assembly editor</title><link>https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great tool! Used to bypass a license in one .NET app where we really had bought a lifetime license but it still expired (we were in a hurry and didn't receive the new one in time).The authors homepage has a link to crash iPhone. I clicked it with Chrome on Windows and it crashed :D (https://elektrokill.github.io/).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DnSpy was great. The author (d4d) did many great things for the world of .net reversing and binary analysis, including dnspy and dnlib. One day, i don't know why, they archived most of their repositories.I'm glad electrokill stepped up and maintains dnspyex now. This also shows how resilient open source can be - as long as someone wants to work on the project, it can go on forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this tool, used it mod a Unity game and learn all the internals to see how to integrate my mod with the base game. Was an invaluable resource. It also taught me a lot about how they made that game (Lethal Company) and how it was truly made to ship/get the idea out the door and not for perfection/maintainable code.~~IIRC the maintainer was like 15 years old?~~ Edit: My mistake, the maintainer is 18, https://github.com/ElektroKill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716072</guid></item><item><title>29.

I kind of miss that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AOL Desktop is still a thing in 2025 and was updated as recently as a few days ago.Michael MJD just did a video on it. Still contains Elwood's classic soundbites, along with some snazzy images of current pop stars like Avril Lavigne.https://youtu.be/jUsym8iAWHY?si=vU5I15-qWKaEZPwC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how many recordings he did. I hope that more people come out of the woodwork and share the recordings they bought from him, like in this case, especially if there are some slightly silly ones (like "Use the source, Luke!").Aside: I was so worried it was going to be an AI voice generator based on his voice. I sadly think it's inevitable but I can hope he didn't make enough recordings to be able to reliably synthesize his voice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695005</guid></item><item><title>30.

It was very actively curated in the beginning but it quickly became hard to find the good stuff and after a couple years of emphasis on promoting royalty-free music for film it kind of drifted away from its original mantra of "It's not just free music; it's good music".Honestly kind of bummed with where the project landed, presumably sold for peanuts to a for-profit so they can use it for lead gen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run a soundscape/white noise website (https://ambiph.one) and used FMA to find some really great music for the radio stations, though I did have to do a lot of virtual crate-digging to find it - I found the discovery features very limited.I had a bit more luck on Bandcamp, which lets artists use Creative Commons licences but strangely doesn't surface that at all as a search filter. I had to resort to searching for "some rights reserved" via Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Abandcamp.com+lofi+%2...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was the lead software engineer on this project when it was conceived, designed, and built. The people at WFMU were so great to work with and absolutely dedicated to getting it right.I don't know much about its current incantation, but I appreciate that the owning company kept the original "About" page with my name and the team I worked with to make it happen.It's one of the projects I'm most proud of. Also, sadly (in a personal legacy sense), one of the few projects I've worked on in the past quarter century that is still standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42674003</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a humorous marriage proposal that is entirely composed of office jargon and corporate speak. Through a series of cliché business terms and phrases, the proposer conveys their love and commitment in a playful and satirical manner, showcasing the absurdity of using such language in a deeply personal moment. The blend of romantic sentiment and professional vocabulary creates a comedic contrast, making the proposal both entertaining and relatable to anyone familiar with corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I could be alone, but one of my biggest office-speak pet peeves is using verbs as nouns.Like “ask” (I hear this one all the time), “(value) add”, and “solve” (used in this article - I cringed).I see this a lot on HN too, so again, many others here will obviously not agree. But I’ll intentionally use “request” or “question” over “ask” just in protest.I know the English language has been using some verbs as nouns for millennia, but there are particular ones (like the ones above) that I mostly hear at the office (or outside the office, but spoken by “office folk”), and it’s definitely an annoy.EDIT: Turns out I'm not alone. Thanks for the validate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a long-time friend who, after years in fintech, now sometimes speaks this way unironically in non-work situations.  I mean, I still think he's a good guy overall but when he recommends the DND party splits up to maximize ROI on a spell rather than just say "let's split up", it does make me cringe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I proposed to my wife, I met her after a couple of years and didn't know at the time if she was seeing someone. 
I nudged the conversation towards that topic and once I found out that she isn't, I literally proposed to her in office jargon. 
I said, "So if the vacancy is still available, can I apply?". She said yes, and we got married eventually but she still isn't too happy about that proposal line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42714775</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses generalized LR parsing, an advanced technique used in computer science for analyzing the syntax of programming languages. It explains the underlying principles of LR parsing, detailing how it can efficiently process a wide range of grammars. The author highlights the benefits of generalized LR parsing over traditional methods, such as its ability to handle ambiguities and complex language constructs. Additionally, the article provides insights into the implementation of this parsing technique, including practical examples and theoretical foundations, making it a valuable resource for developers and researchers interested in compiler design and syntax analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this yesterday, asking it to create a simple daily reminder task, which it happily did. Then when the time came and went I simply got a chat that the task failed, with no explanation of why or how it failed. When I asked it why, it hallucinated that I had too many tasks. (I only had the one) So, now I don't know why it failed or how to fix it.  Which leads to two related observations:1) I find it interesting that the LLM rarely seems trained to understand it's own features, or about your account, or how the LLM works. Seems strange that it has no idea about it's own support.2) Which leads me to the Open AI support docs[0]. It seems pretty telling to me that they use old-school search and not an LLM for its own help docs, right?[0] https://help.openai.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New killer feature: cronCan’t imagine why everyone doesn’t pay $200/mo for even more features. Eventually I bet they can clean out /tmp!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm trying to figure out how this would be useful with the existing feature set.It seems like it would be good for summarizing daily updates against a search query. but all it would do is display them. I would probably want to connect it with some tools at minimum for it to be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716356</guid></item><item><title>35.

It has a powerful macro language, in which, among other architectures and formats, it implements x86 and ELF/PE/macho and is able to assemble itself.I like to use it for scripting for turning binary formats to text and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very cool. On the topic of assembly, does anyone know of a language that is higher level than assembly, but retains the property that the output doesn't depend on the compiler or its flags?I want it for low level CPU benchmarks and tests. Using C or assembly for those both suck.I don't really know exactly how this would look (is the register allocator part of the spec?) but has anyone tried something like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demo website at https://hlorenzi.github.io/customasm/web/ makes this even more accessible.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the approval of the Natrium advanced nuclear power plant in Wyoming, which has received a crucial permit from state regulators. This facility, developed by TerraPower and backed by billionaire Bill Gates, aims to demonstrate the potential of advanced nuclear technology as a clean energy source. The project is set to produce electricity using a sodium-cooled reactor and is part of broader efforts to reduce carbon emissions and diversify energy sources in the region. The construction of the plant is expected to create jobs and stimulate local economic growth while also addressing energy reliability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

I have bought a lot of games from GOG and have been very happy.  As an exclusively Linux user, I also appreciate how well GOG works with Lutris et al and that they aren't making life harder for those devs.  I love the offline installers and I deeply appreciate their availability.I'm not a big gamer but after watching the industry and Linux/open source in general for many, many years, I'm more convinced than ever that it's the gaming community who will save general purpose computing (that's also a nod to Valve for everything they've done for Linux as well, which has been major).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I liked GOG, but they ignore Linux users, while Steam's Linux support is the best thing that's happened to Linux gaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now if only GOG could fix their Mac client so that you can actually quit it.Maybe someone at GOG will actually read this and let a project manager to let a programmer know to fix this.  Because they keep doing everything else other than fixing a really really annoying bug.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their impact on healthcare costs, highlighting the practices of major companies like UnitedHealth, CVS Caremark, and Cigna. It emphasizes concerns about the opacity of PBM pricing structures, high drug prices, and the potential for a monopoly in the PBM market, which could hinder competition and drive up costs for consumers. The FTC aims to address these issues in an effort to improve transparency and reduce prescription drug prices.&lt;/p&gt;

From the report:&gt; "Higher markups can also result in larger internal transfer payments from health plans to affiliated pharmacies, which may allow vertically integrated PBM-pharmacy-insurer entities to retain revenue and profits while formally satisfying the insurers' medical loss ratio ("MLR" ) requirements, but without providing the clinical care and quality improvements that the MLR rule seeks to promote. In
addition, higher markups can result in significant patient cost sharing requirements because
reimbursement rates are often correlated with point-of-sale prices, which can influence how
much patients are required to pay."In other words.  Health insurance firms have capped profits in the US.  But in this case one conglomerate can own both an insurer and a PBM, so it can just overcharge consumers for insurance and then launder its profits through the PBM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/cg4weI do not like UnitedHealth, I do not like our existing crop of health insurance executives, and I might even be viscerally glad at some level that the UnitedHealth CEO was killed in a world where justice clearly takes a back seat to greed, but I wish the headline didn't say "overcharged", because there's no established amount of markup that is the correct amount of markup other than what people end up paying. Is that shitty? Yes. Does it violate a social contract? I think so. But tell me how much the right amount to charge is first. Is that cost? Cost+percentage? They've chosen their percentage. What's the correct one instead?The article body presents the story in a more meaningful way, "UnitedHealth Group is charging patients a markup for key life-saving drugs that could easily exceed their cost by a factor of ten or more".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42716428</guid></item><item><title>40.

It emphasizes the challenges of maintaining consistency and reliability in environments where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Key topics include the CAP theorem, various transaction models, and the importance of designing systems that can handle failures gracefully. The author also explores different strategies for achieving consensus and ensuring data integrity, highlighting real-world applications and best practices relevant to developers and system architects working with distributed architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So one shot transactions can check if every timestamp in every write and item inside the transaction packet depends on data that is before the timestamp of that particular monotonic transaction timestamp?And the pattern of including "check" transaction item is how we manually maintain data integrity (characteristic of Atomic in DBMS)And we know which transactions are writing because they told us they wanted to write in the prepare phase (the part that the transaction manager handles separate from the one shot transaction information perspective from the client with its own communication between the transaction manager and storage nodes)I implemented a toy dynamodb that is a trie in front of a hash map, it handles the "begins with" query style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny, I've just been asked to provide a basic implementation in DynamoDB for large amount of real time transactions for fraud detection. Let's see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using DynamoDB in 2025 is such a weird proposition.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the year 2007, my working assumption is that if data is not on ZFS on physically redundant media that the data has not been successfully saved. And, any machines that don't have ZFS (some RedHat based boxes) should be configured only through Ansible and configured with the intention that all data (including syslogs) is either forwarded somewhere that does have ZFS or is accessed via NFS (backed by ZFS).Or Ceph Bluestore, which does checksums on physically redundant media. We do N+3 replication because we're lazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know TheFineArticle is in Linux land but for Windows people with this issue you might look at Sysinternals Disk2vhd.[0]It can be run from the online OS itself and it can store the resulting vhd on the same disk it is imaging (with space and disk performance constraints).I find it handy for turning my freshly superceded gaming machine into a VM on my new machine for easy access to files, before doing whatever with my old hardware.[0] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/dis...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, while these block level methods do have a use case, parallel rsync and other file level tools are far safer and often faster with less additional load on the disk.Duplicating the OS/FS behavior hits the decidable problem and you just hope for the best with block level, often you won't notice corruption either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673171</guid></item><item><title>42.

When a bug escapes, it's both the author _and_ reviewer at fault.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I also pushed for breaking large changes into smaller commits, because it is impossible to do a thorough review otherwise.I've found this to be key for both giving and receiving feedback.

And Github's https://github.com/dependabot/ will do that same thing automatically, just based on the existence of the lockfile in your repo (and will also open PRs to bump deps for you).And as mentioned elsewhere: Cargo's dependency resolver supports providing multiple versions of a dep in different dependency subgraphs, which all but eliminates the "dependency hell" that folks expect from ecosystems like Python or the JVM. Two copies of a dep at different versions? Totally fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ With a team of three experienced developers, we have implemented ScopeDB from scratch”“ with 100 direct dependencies and 647 dependencies in total”Next up: watch me build numpy from scratch with only 150 dependencies, one of which numpy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't that something that should be posted April 1? I'm really not sure if the author is proud about the fact that his project has so many dependencies. Is that something modern coders aim for these days?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the controversial use of xenon gas by climbers attempting to summit Everest, highlighting that this substance, which enhances physical performance and is banned in sports, is being utilized by some in the mountaineering community. It profiles various climbers who have reportedly benefited from xenon gas, examining the ethical implications of its use in a sport that already faces challenges with cheating and fair play. The piece raises questions about regulation and safety in extreme sports, particularly in high-stakes environments like Everest, and reflects on the broader impact of performance-enhancing substances in athletic endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhaling Xenon gas is known to be a psychoactive experience, which I only learned about on the show Hamilton’s Pharmacopoeia. He claims the atomic structure of Xenon, by pure chance, fits nicely into one of the psychoactive receptors in the brain.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14099126/?ref_=ttep_ep_3https://boingboing.net/2021/11/25/hamilton-morris-experience...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a theory that the mechanism of action of xenon and perhaps other anesthetics is on the microtubules rather than the receptors, having implications for the neural correlates of consciousness itselfhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09992-7https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXElfzVgg6Mhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S15710...https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07936&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't Xenon infamous for being ridiculously expensive? It's the best general anesthetic by a mile since it's a noble gas, but we don't use it because the cost would be absurd. While the amounts used here must be small, and you're going to be stacked if this is how you're approaching Everest, it must still cost a small fortune — and turns out it does:&gt; One session of xenon gas costs $5,000 per person for a 30-minute session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42705180</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "Keon" is a project focused on enhancing the functionality of a programming library designed for algorithm and data structure learning. It provides a collection of implementations and examples in Python, covering various concepts such as searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, and data structures like linked lists and trees. The repository encourages contributions from the community to improve and expand the library, making it a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to deepen their understanding of algorithms and data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

I've written back ends for all three serialization formats used by Second Life.[1] 
(There's a binary form, an XML form, and something called "notation".)
But other than for compatibility with existing code, there's no reason to use them.[1] https://github.com/John-Nagle/serde-llsd&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; human-readable&gt; sytacticly similar to RustChoose one.I kid, I kid, but Rust is not the easiest-reading language out there. It has the same problem as C++, with a syntax that's not terribly straightforward to begin with, but then it's just liberally sprinkled with nearly every bit of punctuation that can by typed with the US QWERTY layout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like there’s three different ways that JSON objects are represented in KEON.It might be more concise, e.g., in the Newtype case, but the sacrifice seems to be quite a bit more cognitive complexity, which I would personally value over conciseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42667080</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses static embeddings in the context of natural language processing (NLP), explaining their foundational role in transforming words into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand. It covers various types of static embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, detailing how these embeddings capture semantic meanings and relationships between words. The piece also highlights the limitations of static embeddings compared to contextual embeddings, emphasizing their lack of adaptability to different contexts. Additionally, the blog provides insights into practical applications and comparisons, guiding readers on the usage and understanding of static embeddings in NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the themes and nuances of the song "Talk Dirty to Me" by the band Poison, highlighting its blend of pop and rock elements. It analyzes the lyrics, which focus on themes of desire and physical attraction, and emphasizes the catchy, upbeat nature of the music that captures the essence of the glam metal genre popularized in the late '80s. The piece reflects on the cultural impact of the song and its place in the band's discography, illustrating how it resonates with audiences through its playful and bold expressions of flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;With ~2/3 (and growing) of Earth’s land area being arid, you’d expect there to be a lot more interest in reverse-desertification. It’s pretty well established by now that it’s almost entirely a labor allocation issue given that there’s success stories all over the world [1] (including in the US [2]) to just create earthworks that slow and divert water. Water seems to be the biggest single issue and so many deserts actually get enough of it during flash floods. With how much Elon is interested in terraforming Mars why not just start here?[1] https://youtu.be/UAmai36XJDk?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...
[2] https://youtu.be/3JyEHdJS94s?list=PLoU8oWWwU-06BGLH5y7AMbybv...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amending with biochar is a very good way to jump start the soil life, but regenerative agriculture should go much further than that. There's a bunch of techniques developed in the last few decades, notably permaculture and syntropic agroforestry, as well as techniques for preventing erosion in difficult topography such as keyline planting and scales.But for the soil to be really alive, lots of plants must be planted, in a polyculture context. It's the photosynthesis that feeds the soil's fauna, which then support the plants,  increase fertility and carbon content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, I actually do some of this but I'm planning on doing a bit more that I'd like to get their feedback on. For background, I live in the PNW among the trees. My soil is part of a long dead riverbed and thus is mainly silt and sand. I have chickens, a worm bin, and a medium sized compost pile. The trees have the same erosive properties that trees in the Boreal forest have. Douglas firs have shallow roots but are towering trees, the soil just doesn't do them any favors.I'm building a chicken coop that's designed to take pine shavings and be completely emptied once a month with relative ease. The idea is to take the chicken poop and pine shavings and add them to the compost pile. I'll further introduce new worms from my separate vermiculture bin and add them to the compost. This should speed up the break down, but the pile will primarily rely on the Berkeley method to accomplish faster cycles. Each month I should start getting pounds of fresh compost that I can move around my yard.Secondarily to my chicken and worm hobby I love to smoke meat and cheese. I use all of the ash from the pellets to amend the soil as well. I pile it up in a box and spread it around when it gets full. I then till the soil, working it in over time. The natural acidity of the soil from the fir needles has slowly started regressing, but that's the most progress I've gotten thus far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710622</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision of the Keygen team to eliminate phone calls as a means of customer support. They argue that calls can be unproductive and often lead to misunderstandings, advocating instead for written communication methods like email and chat. This approach not only allows for clearer documentation and quicker responses but also enables the support team to manage inquiries more effectively. The article emphasizes that this change is aimed at enhancing both customer satisfaction and the team's efficiency in addressing issues efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a CTO who makes purchasing decisions.  There are numerous products I likely would have purchased, but I either find a substitute or just go without because I won't play the stupid "let's get on a call" game.If your website doesn't give me enough information to:1.  Know enough about your product to know that it will (generally speaking) meet my needs/requirements.2.  Know that the pricing is within the ballpark of reasonable given what your product does.Then I will move on (unless I'm really desparate, which I assure you is rarely the case).  I've rolled-my-own solution more than once as well when there were no other good competitors.That's not to say that calls never work or don't have a place, because they definitely do.  The key to using the call successfully (with me at least) is to use the call to get into true details about my needs, after I know that you're at least in the ballpark.  Additionally, the call should be done efficiently.  We don't need a 15 minute introduction and overview about you.  We don't need a bunch of small talk about weather or sports.  2 minutes of that is ok, or when waiting for additional people to join the call, but beyond that I have things to do.I know what my needs are.  I understand you need some context on my company and needs in order to push useful information forward, and I also understand that many potential customers will not take the lead in asking questions and providing that context, but the sooner you take the temperature and adjust, the better.  Also, you can get pretty far as a salesperson if you just spend 5 minutes looking at our website before the call!  Then you don't have to ask basic questions about what we do.  If you're willing to invest in the time to get on a call, then it's worth a few minutes of time before-hand to look at our website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only works if your sales strategy is all about inbound sales, i.e. content marketing (like this article)/ads.But if you're an enterprise b2b company and want to grow quickly rather than taking 8 years to go beyond 1 solopreneur like this guy you're going to want to do outbound sales.It's also worth noting that this guys is mostly doing small deals. The literal largest price he has on his pricing page is 72k/yr, which isn't tiny, but his typical deal size is likely much smaller, so it makes total sense for him not to get on a call for $49/month, because that is not a scalable strategy.But many enterprise b2b companies have a more complicated product than Keygen and charge orders of magnitude more than they do.Which is not to say that he is wrong, it's just that this is the correct strategy for scaling a low ACV product, rather than a high ACV product. And a low ACV product has to have much broader demand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In most of these discussions, people on the sales side claim, "but our customers WANT this! Trust us!" and most of the people on the buying side scream, "We hate this. Please let us buy it without this song and dance."
It's a shocking disconnect to me.
(For what it's worth, I'm squarely on the fouder/engineering buying side and hate the call song and dance, and only engage in it as a last resort.)Parting thought: SpaceX tells you how much it costs to ship something INTO SPACE. I bet you can figure out a way to tell me your SaaS price, in ballpark terms, and what it depends upon...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725385</guid></item><item><title>2.

Virtually every day was the same. Very clear. Very still.I’m not sure if anyone could ever “get” one of his movies completely beyond the experience and the narrative. He always left so much unsaid and open to interpretation, just like life. They are movies designed to make the viewer feel a certain way, rather than literally what’s in the screen. He was one of the few directors that I thought of as making weird things that I would enjoy (most of the time), but how could anyone else?“I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the pandemic David Lynch released a daily weather video in which he reported what the weather was at his home in Los Angeles.First video was May 11, 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krIj6eLF4mULast video was December 16, 2022: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l21GFyOO8UgHe also released a daily video in which he drew a bingo number.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to abandon social media algorithms in favor of using RSS feeds for content consumption. It emphasizes the benefits of RSS, such as increased control over the content one engages with and reduced exposure to negative influences of algorithm-driven platforms. The author argues that RSS fosters a more intentional and curated online experience, allowing users to connect with the content and creators they genuinely appreciate, rather than being dictated by algorithms that prioritize engagement over relevance. Overall, the piece encourages readers to consider the switch to RSS for a more personalized and fulfilling way to consume information online.&lt;/p&gt;

You can can create an RSS feed from Reddit.You can't to my best knowledge create an RSS feed anymore from TwitterNewsletter to RSS: https://kill-the-newsletter.com/More stuff:Blogs &amp; RSS

https://code.rosaelefanten.org/rssparser.lisp/dir?ci=tipThis one you have to pay. I am considering it. Some RSS feeds don't work on my TinyTinyRSS. I think cloudflare, like always, is killing it:https://politepol.com/en/pricesPS: If you have an idea for a RSS reader domain, please suggest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good algorithm is a good thing. However what a good algorithm is for me is often different from what it is for those who maintain them. Outrage gets attention and sometimes it is needed, but there is a level of too much, and also a lot of outrage unfairly represents the issues and so it makes me mad even though if I understood the details I wouldn't be mad just concerned.I want an algorithm that surfaces things of interest to me, then says "you have seen it all, go outside" (with an option of if I'm confined to a hospital bed to go on).  Algorithm maintainers want me to keep scrolling for more ad dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a big proponent of RSS, but I think that it suffers from a lack of imagination these days, for example, the "quality filter" approach mentioned in this article is not very useful imo.The biggest cost of RSS feed items as a consumer is figuring out whether something is worth reading. A lot of feeds these days don't provide anything useful in the body to make a determination on this, and others just dump the entire contents in the body, which means you're wasting a bunch of time reading N% of something until you realize you're not interested in it and it can be skipped.In addition to this, RSS feeds tend to be structured to just throw everything at you, regardless of the topics you are interested in.For a few years I have been publishing my own topic-specific feeds[1] for others to consume where I fill the body with my own personal highlights from the source, with a link through to the source (ie. the things I found interesting, the "hooks" that give a quick signal to a consumer if this might be something they want to invest time in reading). They have a couple of die-hard consumers, but ultimately this really a case of a niche within a niche.I wish there were more feeds like this for me as a consumer, but unfortunately I get the feeling that this idea will never really become popular enough to catch on widely as RSS becomes less and less relevant to the mainstream.[1]: my software development topic RSS feed for example: https://notado.app/feeds/jado/software-development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724284</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haha, this would be an amazing way to test the ChatGPT crawler reflective DDOS vulnerability [1] I published last week.Basically a single HTTP Request to ChatGPT API can trigger 5000 HTTP requests by ChatGPT crawler to a website.The vulnerability is/was thoroughly ignored by OpenAI/Microsoft/BugCrowd but I really wonder what would happen when ChatGPT crawler interacts with this tarpit several times per second. As ChatGPT crawler is using various Azure IP ranges I actually think the tarpit would crash first.The vulnerability reporting experience with OpenAI / BugCrowd was really horrific. It's always difficult to get attention for DOS/DDOS vulnerabilities and companies always act like they are not a problem. But if their system goes dark and the CEO calls then suddenly they accept it as a security vulnerability.I spent a week trying to reach OpenAI/Microsoft to get this fixed, but I gave up and just published the writeup.I don't recommend you to exploit this vulnerability due to legal reasons.[1] https://github.com/bf/security-advisories/blob/main/2025-01-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having first run a bot motel in I think 2005, I'm thrilled and greatly entertained to see this taking off. When I first did it, I had crawlers lost in it literally for days; and you could tell that eventually some human would come back and try to suss the wreckage. After about a year I started seeing URLs like ../this-page-does-not-exist-hahaha.html. Sure it's an arms race but just like security is generally an afterthought these days, don't think that you can't be the woodpecker which destroys civilization. The comments are great too, this one in particular reflects my personal sentiments:&gt;  the moment it becomes the basic default install ( ala adblocker in browsers for people ), it does not matter what the bigger players want to do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had our non-profit website drained out of bandwidth and site closed temporarily (!!) from our hosting deal because of Amazon bot aggressively crawling like ?page=21454 ... etc.Gladly Siteground restored our site without any repercussions as it was not our fault. Added Amazon bot into robots.txt after that one.Don't like how things are right now. Is a tarpit the solution? Or better laws? Would they stop the chinese bots? Should they even? I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725147</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see that Nintendo is treating the switch more like how they traditionally handled their mobile platforms instead of their consoles.Iterating instead of throwing out everything with each new version. There is a part of me that is going to miss the, do weird shit and see what works, Nintendo that brought us some really fun ideas. But a stable Nintendo just being able to continue putting out great games has its advantages.I am curious about the specs, but honestly don't care much. The only real issue the Switch had was being able to keep up with some of the games put on it with FPS but it still had beautiful games (like Tears of the Kingdom). So as long as it is actually a decent spec bump I am happy and have zero care to compare it to the other consoles (but I am sure people are going too and scream that it is "underpowered").The biggest thing I am curious about, will it be OLED since that will be disappointing to go back to non OLED from the OLED Switch. And Price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had a lot of frustration with Switch joy-cons. Not only drift, which has claimed a number of them, but also issues with the console not recognizing when they are attached, and one pair that for some reason the switch won't recognize when trying to use in the horizontal orientation. No doubt my kids have subjected it to hard use and probably a drop or two, but still frustrating.It looks like they've added some reinforcement to the joysticks, and changed the connection with the main body to be magnetic instead of sliding in and out (which causes wear and tear on the connectors over time). I hope the Switch 2 is more robust than the original Switch.Some extra horsepower would also be appreciated. Recently we were trying to play Switch Sports with 4 players, and even my kids who are generally oblivious to graphical fidelity and framerate were complaining that it was basically unplayable in 4-player split screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't like the aesthetic as much as the Switch 1. Looks a little too sleek, too monochrome, not Nintendo-y enough. Other than the splash of color around the thumbsticks it looks like any number of those handheld Steam Deck-alikes that have been coming out.That said I always wait for the special Zelda editions of Nintendo's consoles, so I don't know that I have standing to complain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724621</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fundamentals of memory management in computer systems, emphasizing its critical role in efficiently allocating and managing memory resources for applications. It covers key concepts such as memory allocation, fragmentation, and garbage collection, along with different strategies employed for managing memory, including stack and heap allocation. The author aims to provide a clear understanding of how memory management works and its impact on system performance, along with insights into common challenges faced in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't proper usage of realloc:    lines = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

In case it cannot service the reallocation and returns NULL, it will overwrite "lines" with NULL, but the memory that "lines" referred to is still there and needs to be either freed or used.The proper way to call it would be:    tmp = realloc(lines, (num_lines + 1) * sizeof(char *));

    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(lines);
        lines = NULL;
        // ... possibly exit the program (without a memory leak)
    } else {
        lines = tmp;
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example strdup implementation:  char *strdup(const char *str) { 
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    char *retval = malloc(len);
    if (!retval) {
      return NULL; 
    }
    strcpy(retval, str);
    return retval;
  }

Has a very common defect.  The malloc call does not reserve enough space for the NUL byte required for successful use of strcpy, thus introducing heap corruption.Also, assuming a NULL pointer is bitwise equal to 0 is not portable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for such a detailed article.In my spare time working with C as a hobby I am usually in "vertical mode" which is different to how I would work (carefully) at work, which is just getting things done end-to-end as fast as possible, not careful at every step that we have no memory errors. So I am just trying to get something working end-to-end so I do not actually worry about memory management when writing C. So I let the operating system handle memory freeing. I am trying to get the algorithm working in my hobby time.And since I wrote everything in Python or Javascript initially, I am usually porting from Python to C.If I were using Rust, it would force me to be careful in the same way, due to the borrow checker.I am curious: we have reference counting and we have Profile guided optimisation.Could "reference counting" be compiled into a debug/profiled build and then detect which regions of time we free things in before or after (there is a happens before relation with dropping out of scopes that reference counting needs to run) to detect where to insert frees? (We Write timing metadata from the RC build, that encapsulates the happens before relationships)Then we could recompile with a happens-before relation file that has correlations where things should be freed to be safe.EDIT: Any discussion about those stack diagrams and alignment should include a link to this wikipedia page;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683616</guid></item><item><title>8.

Materials are being stressed so much while trying to defy the laws of physics that the smallest angle error, the smallest pressure mismatch, smallest timing error, and boom. This did not happen when we were inventing cars, trains and air planes. Now imagine these risks, while you're halfway to mars. Is it possible that we just have no found/invented the right materials or the right fuel/propulsion mechanism to de-risk this, and that is where we should be allocating a lot more resources?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731091</guid></item><item><title>9. 2k-year-old wine and the uncanny immediacy of the past</title><link>https://resobscura.substack.com/p/2000-year-old-wine-and-the-uncanny</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fascinating story of a 2,000-year-old wine found in a Roman tomb, delving into its historical significance, the science behind ancient winemaking, and the connection between culture and memory. It reflects on the uncanny experience of tasting such an ancient beverage, contemplating the themes of time, preservation, and the impact of history on the present. Through this narrative, the writer highlights the interplay between archaeology and sensory experiences, suggesting that ancient artifacts can evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article about artifacts that make the past more immediate, that allow us to connect our experiences to people hundreds or thousands of years ago.My favorite example is the writings of Onfim, who was a little boy in the 1200s in present day Russia whose scribbling and homework were exquisitely preserved on birch bark fragments. It’s so immediately recognizable as a little boy’s endearing doodles about knights and imaginary beasts, yet its 800 years old.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree these objects (just like colourised photos) help bridge the distance to the past. But I've had the same experience purely with text. If you read Cicero's letters and diaries, and then just imagine him - suffering writer's block, wracked with anxiety and self-doubt, desperate for his friends to cheer him up - as a neurotic, terminally-online Twitter user, it fits perfectly and breathes life into his every word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating! The wine discovery reminds me one scene from the book 'The Dark Forest'[0] when the protagonist drinks a wine from some centuries before... spoiler: it wasn't good.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717393</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the context of large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the importance of TDD as an approach to improve software quality and maintainability by writing tests before code. The author explains how applying TDD principles to LLMs can enhance their reliability and performance, detailing methodologies for implementing TDD with these models. The post also explores potential challenges and considerations when adopting TDD for LLMs, ultimately advocating for its practice to foster better development outcomes in AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One trend I've noticed, framed as a logical deduction:1. Coding assistants based on o1 and Sonnet are pretty great at coding with &lt;50k context, but degrade rapidly beyond that.2. Coding agents do massively better when they have a test-driven reward signal.3. If a problem can be framed in a way that a coding agent can solve, that speeds up development at least 10x from the base case of human + assistant.4. From (1)-(3), if you can get all the necessary context into 50k tokens and measure progress via tests, you can speed up development by 10x.5. Therefore all new development should be microservices written from scratch and interacting via cleanly defined APIs.Sure enough, I see HN projects evolving in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a similar note, has anyone found themselves absolutely not trusting non-code LLM output?The code is at least testable and verifiable. For everything else I am left wondering if it's the truth or a hallucination. It incurs more mental burden that I was trying to avoid using LLM in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have yet to see an LLM + TDD essay where the author demonstrates any mastery of Test Driven Development.Is the label "TDD" being hijacked for something new? Did that already happen? Are LLMs now responsible for defining TDD?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726584</guid></item><item><title>11.

Now it's ridding yourself of the baggage of an almost-dead platform that you're about to make fully dead.Still appreciate getting the tooling as FOSS rather than just terminating it, but let's not go for delusions here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42721442</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Shopify's five-year journey using React Native, highlighting how the platform has benefited from the framework in developing mobile applications. It details the challenges and successes encountered during this period, including performance improvements, enhancements in user experience, and the advantages of cross-platform development. The piece also emphasizes insights gained and future plans for further leveraging React Native to improve application development processes at Shopify. Overall, it showcases the impact of React Native on Shopify’s mobile strategy and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with most of the other comments here, and it sounds like Shopify made sound tradeoffs for their business. I'm sure the people who use Shopify's apps are able to accomplish the tasks they need to.But as a user of computers and occasional native mobile app developer, hearing "&lt;500ms screen load times" stated as a win is very disappointing. Having your app burn battery for half a second doing absolutely nothing is bad UX. That kind of latency does have a meaningful effect on productivity for a heavy user.Besides that, having done a serious evaluation of whether to migrate a pair of native apps supported by multi-person engineering teams to RN, I think this is a very level-headed take on how to make such a migration work in practice. If you're going to take this path, this is the way to do it. I just hope that people choose targets closer to 100ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the section on the importance of native devs and how they're staffing mobile was really interesting:"Native devs are crucialMobile engineers who specialize in iOS and Android are essential to building great mobile apps. There is no replacing experience and taste that comes from having built many mobile products and deeply understanding conventions and usability. Being able to drop down to the platform layer, write bindings, master build &amp; release, distribution, etc requires native expertise.They also play a vital role in optimizing app performance across the myriad of device models, ensuring a consistent user experience for all users. Additionally, native expertise is essential for managing React Native version updates, as well as adopting new features, APIs, and tooling changes that accompany new iOS and Android releases. You can't build a good product without these experts.We invested in training our native mobile developers in React Native through a self-serve course that covered everything they needed to know to ship production-ready code. Additionally, we set up office hours with developers who were already proficient in React Native to provide support through Q&amp;A sessions, pair programming, and code reviews.We also supplemented our mobile teams with some web developers for their Javascript, Typescript, and React expertise. This ensured we had strong expertise in both native and React Native, and over time, it levelled up the entire team.Having a good mix of native and web developers is the key to building great mobile apps using React Native in our experience. "&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised that there was no mention of Expo. In the past, I would say bare-metal is better than Expo-managed React Native projects because of the limitations when it came to native modules. Fast forward to today, and anything you can do in a bare metal RN app can be done with Expo.The biggest game-changer recently is Expo's Continuous Native Generation[0]. You can configure all of your native modules and ios/android files with a simple config file (which has its limits, whereby you'll need to write an Expo Config Plugin[1]). You will no longer commit the ios/android native code to your repository, and instead let it be procedurally built.This resolved a lot of environment issues developers would often run into, and greatly simplified onboarding new devs. You can build your iOS/Android apps through the CI with ease. And you'll no longer be afraid of upgrading React Native, as Expo will handle all of the breaking changes in the native code for you.My guess is that Shopify started with bare metal React Native apps (which I would have done the same 5 years ago), and now migrating back to Expo-managed projects is nontrivial. At my work we only manage one app, and it was well worth migrating back.[0] https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/[1] https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690114</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have discovered a new method for arranging spheres in a way that enhances the understanding of how they can "kiss" or touch each other. The research uncovers novel configurations of spheres, revealing complex mathematical structures and relationships that challenge existing theories of sphere packing. This finding not only deepens insight into geometric and topological properties but also has potential implications in various fields such as physics and materials science, emphasizing the intricate patterns and behaviors of spatial arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd really love to know what the mathematicians are actually doing when they work this stuff out? Is it all on computers now? Can they somehow visualize 24-dimensional-sphere-packings in their minds? Are they maybe rigorously checking results of a 'test function' that tells them they found a correct/optimal packing? I would love to know more about what the day-to-day work involved in this type of research actually would be!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interesting ta for me:&gt; Had she been one of his graduate students, he would have tried harder to convince her to work on something else. “If they work on something hopeless, it’ll be bad for their career,” he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's strange the article doesn't even mention just trying to simulate the problem computationally.Surely it's not too difficult to repeatedly place spheres around a central sphere in 17 dimensions, maximizing how many kiss for each new sphere added, until you get a number for how many fit? And add some randomness to the choices to get a range of answers Monte Carlo-style, to then get some idea of the lower bound? [Edit: I meant upper bound, whoops.]Obviously ideally you want to discover a mathematically regular approach if you can. But surely computation must also play a role here in narrowing down reasonable bounds for the problem?And computation will of course be essential if the answer turns out to be chaotic for certain numbers of dimensions, if the optimal solution is just a jumble without any kind of symmetry at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42723406</guid></item><item><title>14.

These applications are eye-wateringly expensive-- like similar in pricing to top-class EDA software licenses.With the abundance GPU's and modern UI's, I wonder how much work would be involved for someone to make optical design software that blows away the old tools. It would be ray-tracing, but with interesting complications like accounting for polarization, diffraction, scattering, fluorescence, media effects beyond refraction like like birefringence and stuff like Kerr and Pockels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this book so much. The literate programming style I think inspired from Knuth's cweb, great writing, beautiful high-quality physical book worth buying but also free access to knowledge. The literate-programming style means you are almost immediately applying theory to a practical system, I keep having to take breaks to learn outside math/physics though, but it is self-contained in principle I think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This and https://hint.userweb.mwn.de/understanding_mp3/index.html are both amazingly fun examples of literate programming that I recommend all of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42683731</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comments here are focused on how much energy it would take to turn this into fuel. The real story here is decentralized fertilizer production, buried at the end of the article:&gt; this innovation could fundamentally reshape fertilizer manufacturing by providing a more sustainable, cost-effective alternative to centralized productionThe high energy cost of Haber-Bosch, plus the additional cost of transportation from manufacturer to farmer could potentially be eliminated by distributed, passive fertilizer generators scattered around in the fields.I'm no expert, but assuming sufficient local production, low concentration could potentially be overcome by continuous fertilization with irrigation throughout the growing season.Let's find out. Some quick fiddling with a molarity calculator and an almanac:-- 100 uM ammonia -&gt; 1.7 mg / L ammonia-- 82% nitrogen -&gt; 1.4 mg / L nitrogen-- My lawn needs around 1 lb / 1000 sq ft, or around 5 g / m2-- So my lawn needs about 3500 L / m2 of fertilized irrigation total for the season-- Ballpark farming irrigation is around 0.2 inches per day, or around 5L/m2I would need to water my lawn about 700 days in the year, or more realistically up my irrigation rate by about a factor of 4, AND source all of the water from the fertilizer box.I'm a little skeptical that I can allocate space for enough production and still have a lawn left to fertilize. The tech probably isn't ready for the big time on an industrial farm yet, but for research demo, this seems like a promising direction! Much more than concentrating it for fuel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article mentions "Traditional methods for ammonia production require high temperatures and pressures" in reference to the existing Haber-Bosch process for producing NH3 from thin air, an interesting historic story on its own.https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-breadhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73464/the-alchemy-o...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are these really catalysts in the traditional definition of the word? Meaning that the catalyst is non-sacrificial? This appears to be suggesting that nitration can be done with atomospheric N2 simply with the right catalyst. But N2 is triple bonded, and the lowest theoretical threshold to react N2 with anything is by breaking at least one of those bonds, which is incredibly energy intensive even under theoretically optimal conditions.Some of the most promising research in replacing Haber-Bosch is actually plasma-assisted nitration, which is basically just as energy intensive as Haber-Bosch, but with drastically lower capital requirements...something that could be done in your backyard. I struggle to see how an ATP catalyst-only method could even do anything close to breaking an N2 triple bond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725823</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Oh Shit, Git! is a resource designed to help users understand and resolve common Git mistakes. The website provides straightforward explanations and practical solutions for issues like accidental commits, unintentional branch changes, and complex merges. It covers various scenarios that can cause frustration for both beginners and experienced Git users, offering step-by-step commands to fix problems and recover lost work effectively. The aim is to empower users with the knowledge to handle errors confidently and improve their Git proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some changes I would make:1. Always use `git switch` instead of `git checkout`2. Avoid `reset --hard` at all costs. So for the "accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch" issue, I would do this instead:    # create a new branch from the current state of master
    git branch some-new-branch-name
    # switch to the previous commit
    git switch -d HEAD~
    # overwrite master branch to that commit instead
    git switch -C master
    # switch to the work branch you created
    git switch some-new-branch-name
    # your commit lives in this branch now :)

3. I'd apply the same to the `cherry-pick` version of "accidentally committed to the wrong branch":    git switch name-of-the-correct-branch
    # grab the last commit to master
    git cherry-pick master
    # delete it from master
    git switch -d master~
    git switch -C master

4. And also to the "git-approved" way for "Fuck this noise, I give up.":    # get the lastest state of origin
    git fetch origin
    # reset tracked files
    git restore -WS .
    # delete untracked files and directories
    git clean -d --force
    # reset master to remote version
    git switch -d origin/master
    git switch -C master
    # repeat for each borked branch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should start recommending UIs as the default way to learn  Git. It would solve a third of these problems and another third wouldn't even come up.If you later decide that the CLI is faster, go ahead. But first, people need to see visually how they can interact with the tree.I like fork.dev, but most clients are pretty similar at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe I have a good mental model of what git does, but I never remember commands' arguments to use when they are moderately complex. I mean that the commands are not discoverable or easy to memorize.I don't know if that's because the text UI is bad, or because it's simply difficult to explain with text what to do to manipulate a tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728916</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of interest and relevance: This past semester, Andy Pavlo's DB seminar at CMU explored a number of projects under the heading 'Database Building Blocks', starting with  DataFusion and several of its applications.  Take a listen!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjZc2AdXq_Lc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a cambrian explosion in data processing engines: DataFusion, Polars, DuckDB, Feldera, Pathway, and more than i can remember.It reminds of 15 years ago where there was JDBC/ODBC for data. Then when data volumes increased, specialized databases became viable - graph, document, json, key-value, etc.I don't see SQL and Spark hammers keeping their ETL monopolies for much longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like I'm not the target audience for this. When I have large data, then I directly write SQL queries and run them against the database. It's impossible to improve performance when you have to go out to the DB anyway; might as well have it run the query too. Certainly the server ops and db admins have loads more money to spend on making the DB fast compared with my anti-virus laden corporate laptop.When I have small data that fits on my laptop, Pandas is good enough.Maybe 10% of the time I have stuff that's annoyingly slow to run with Pandas; then I might choose a different library, but needing this is rare. Even then, of that 10% you can solve 9% of that by dropping down to numpy and picking a better algorithm...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675804</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin successfully achieved orbital flight with its New Glenn rocket for the first time, marking a significant milestone for the company. The rocket, named after the famed science fiction author Jules Verne, is designed to carry large payloads to space and aims to compete in the growing commercial launch market. The launch demonstrated advanced technology and capabilities, paving the way for future missions and establishing Blue Origin as a serious player in the aerospace industry. The success of this launch could lead to increased opportunities for both commercial and governmental satellite projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty unusual for a new space company to make orbit on their first launch.  Generally par for the course in established companies is 2 failures in the first 10 launches so lets see how they do.The stage didn't land successfully but I'd have been very surprised if they got that on the first try.NG's launch price is supposedly only about 50% higher than a Falcon 9 with a lot more payload weight and volume.  Hopefully this will result in SpaceX cutting their price, they've got a lot of room to do so before hitting their launch costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the cameras used film like NASA did for Saturn V. The digital cameras used on these launches basically show a white blob with no detail due to digital cameras having such low dynamic range compared to film. And this is made worse with the night launches that Blue Origin are doing.In Saturn V launches you could see see detail in the bright flame structures along with background detail.Maybe some of the upcoming digital cameras chips will have higher dynamic range eventually. I know Nikon has a paper talking about stacked sensors that are trading off high frame rate for high dynamic range: https://youtu.be/jcc1CvqCTeU?si=DuIu4BK48iZTlyB2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a pretty hardcore SpaceX fan but hats off to the BlueOrigin team. Orbit on the first try is no small feat. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42722756</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reuploaded the PDF here - https://nokia-apple-iphone-was-launched-presentation.tiiny.s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was there as this played out. Nokia had a lot of good software and software engineers but not the management structure to do anything good with that.Nokia was huge as an organization and parts of that organization recognized the threat early on. The problem was at the board and executive level. These people had a blind spot for software. They thought they were still in the electronics business. Lots of people with an electronics and radio background. Not a lot of people with software competence. And they had bought into the notion that Symbian was going to magically fix all their problems.A lot of effort was spent on looking for other solutions. And one of the things that was good (Linux) around 2005 was actually quite close to displacing Symbian as the key future proof replacement for their legacy platforms. Symbian was just rolling out for a few years and they had made a big investment in that. And management (those same people with a huge blind spot for software) backed the wrong horse.Linux never really died in Nokia but it wasn't allowed to prosper either. Devices were cancelled or repurposed for Symbian. This happened to the N8, for example. By the time they switched to windows phone, they actually had two Linux platforms (Meego and Meltemi) and an Android phone in the works as well. Meego had one last product phone launch and the team and platform were killed in the same week. Any devices for that platform were labeled as developer phones. Nokia never marketed them as a consumer phone. Meltemi never saw any product launch at all; it was aimed at feature phones. Both were good ideas but poorly executed. Nokia killed them along with Symbian in order to back windows phone. Classic baby and bathwater situation.And MS ended up killing the one Nokia Android phone that was launched shortly before they acquired the whole phone division. Kind of a desperate/ballsy move. I suspect Nokia did this as a stick to ensure MS followed through with the acquisition. That was their "oh we could just switch from windows phone to Android unless.. " move. Nokia was at point the only OEM that still believed in Windows Phone.MS killed the whole division shortly after Satya Nadella took over and was sorting out the mess left by Steve Ballmer. The iphone was solidly in charge by then and the rest of the market was Android. Courtesy of lots of Linux contributions by the Meego and Maemo team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Palm when the iPhone launched, and one note from this analysis summed up Apple's new power in the market and how they really changed the landscape."Cingular has allowed Apple to launch a device with WLAN and inbuilt services"At that time, the carriers controlled so much of the cell phone experience. We certainly would have loved to have launched Palm Treo phones with WiFi radios, but our carrier partners wanted the only way to get data in and out of the devices to be through their monetized data plans.  They also wanted to control what you did with that data so they could charge for their own email or messaging systems or web portals.  The same applied to app stores.  Palm OS didn't have a unified app store at that time, just sideloading and some third-party methods, and some carriers had started making their own stores where you could buy apps billed through your cell phone bill.  They hated the idea of a platform owning that, and I expect that was part of the reason Apple originally released it with no app store.  They needed the phone to be a massive hit in order to gain the power to also bypass that wall that the cell companies put up.Palm did benefit from the iPhone launch -- it had us uplevel our efforts away from the post-Palm OS phones that we were in the middle of developing that were aimed at the RIM market and instead try something radical with webOS, and when the Pre launched, it actually had WiFi on board, although the Sprint-exclusive Pixi phone lacked WiFi due to carrier request.  There was some momentum there for a while, but then HP bought us, hit its own set of brick walls with carriers, and ditched the hardware business shortly after Apple started launching on other carriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724761</guid></item><item><title>20.

The introduction says that they train on 37 million real and synthetic images. Are astronauts riding horses now represented in the training data more than would have been possible 5 years ago?If it's possible to get good, generalizable results from such (relatively) small data sets, I'd like to see what this approach can do if trained exclusively on non-synthetic permissively licensed inputs. It might be possible to make a good "free of any possible future legal challenges" image generator just from public domain content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The estimated training time for the end-to-end model on an 8×H100 machine is 2.6 days.That's a $250,000 machine for the micro budget. Or if you don't want to do it locally ~$2,000 to do it on someone else's machine for the one model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681793</guid></item><item><title>21.

Feels like something built in Flash during Nokia's heady days. (Unintentional irony? Nokia was known as a company with lots of Flash concepts and little software product execution.)But the content seems really interesting. These are internal prototypes and documents from Nokia's archive, now released for the first time. I wish there was a way to browse them in chronological order without all this janky graph visualization nonsense.There's a link in the corner that takes you to the actual archive repository:https://repo.aalto.fi/index.php?name=SO_b66a9391-dcf8-4399-8...This seems like it might be a less brain-melting way to browse the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a mess of a webpage. Probably there is interesting content there but the presentation made me close it down immediatley.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UI for this does seem a bit "Baby's first force-directed graph".

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the reasons why some digital services provided by the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) experience outages during nighttime hours. It highlights the challenges related to system maintenance and updates that are often scheduled during off-peak periods to minimize user disruption. The piece emphasizes the importance of these maintenance activities for improving service reliability but acknowledges the inconvenience it may cause to users seeking access to DVLA services at night. Overall, it sheds light on the balance between operational efficiency and user accessibility for government digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent bit of pragmatism and as a user of this service I’m happy with the trade off.People wondering why it’s not a simple switch and “there must be something else going on here” have clearly never worked with layers of legacy systems where the data actually matters. Sure it’s fixable and it’s a shame it hasn’t been but don’t assume there aren’t very good reasons why it’s not a quick fix.The gov.uk team have moved mountains over the past decade, members of it have earned the right to be believed when they say “it’s not simple”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something is missing here, why do batch jobs take 13 hours? If this thing was started on an old mainframe why isn't the downtime just 5 minutes at 3:39 AM?Exactly how much data is getting processed?Edit: Why does rebuilding take a decade or more? This is not a complex system. It doesn't need to solve any novel engineering challenges to operate efficiently. Article does not give much insight into why this particular task couldn't be fixed in 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often ran into this when using DVLA services and spluttered with indignation. But at the end of the day, these services are fantastically usable (during the daytime) and I appreciate Dafydd pushing to just get them out there!I got my license in 2015 so never in my life have I had the apparently ubiquitous American experience of queuing at the DMV and filling in paper forms. (is this still real? or limited to stand-up comedy?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42676545</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So Minimax just "open-sourced" (I add it in "" because they have a custom license for its use and I've not read through that) but they have context length of 4-million tokens and it scored 100% on the needle in a haystack problem. It uses lightning attention - so still attention, just a variation? So this is potentially not as groundbreaking as the publishers of the paper hoped or am I missing something fundamental here? Can this scale better? Does it train more efficiently? The test-time inference is amazing - is that what sets this apart and not necessarily the long context capability? Will it hallucinate a lot less because it stores long-term memory more efficiently and thus won't make up facts but rather use what it has remembered in context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;similar to RWKV7’s new (sub quadratic) attention mechanism which models key values as v≈kS’ and does an in-context descent on ||v - kS’||^2/2 (where the state matrix S is one attentional head) , explained more by the author here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/main/RWKV-...and i tried to unpack it a bit here https://wdmn.fr/rank-1-take-on-rwkv7s-in-context-learning/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the title I thought this was talking about cramming the night before an exam. ;-) Or if it’s an open book exam learning during the exam as one goes through the textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718166</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN! I'm the developer at Jamsocket who made this. In case you're not familiar with Yjs, it's a CRDT library for building collaborative and local-first apps.The thing is, if you're not used to working with distributed state there's definitely a learning curve. Even simple things like incrementing a counter — the "hello world" of JavaScript framework demos — get tricky when dealing with multiple clients. Worse, a lot of tutorials are just like "install this library and text editor integration and boom you have an app", which doesn't give you a good mental model for what's actually happening.So we made Learn Yjs! It's an interactive Yjs tutorial. I wanted it to be really intuitive for people just getting their feet wet with local-first development, so there are lots of explorable demos and coding exercises. The idea is to use interactive examples to build an understanding from the ground up.Hope you like it :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yjs is nice. Easy to get p2p results.Yjs backend, its persistence, eventual conflict resolution (one of editors stayed too long offline), history rewind seems like a tough engineering challenge to crack.Always wanted to have a nice experience with block editor like Platejs https://platejs.org/There are nice attempts simplify dev experience with solutions like Liveblocks https://liveblocks.io/text-editor However most options come at the expense of controlling your data.CRDT keyword search on HN bring consistently good results and interest in the topic, but no good options on open source backend side. Checked it many times in the past. Please correct me if I missed something.https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=tru...Most people expectations it should work at least as in Google Docs or Notion, and on the dev side it should be store privately in Postgres JSONB like format without going deep into details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The trick is a technique called fractional indexing, in which indices are fractions rather than integers.How many times you can use fractional indexing before it stops working?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731582</guid></item><item><title>28.

If you just loaded some protein with a similar MW / migration / concentration as the one you're trying to spoof, the bands would look more or less indistinguishable. And because it's a real unique band (just with the wrong protein), you wouldn't be able to tell it's been faked using visual inspection.Perhaps this is already happening, and we just don't know it... In this way I've always thought gel images were more susceptible to fraud vs. other commonly faked images (NMR / MS spectra etc, which are harder to spoof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have a playlist of 3500 videos showing images like this onehttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXXK20HE_dV8rBa2h-8P9d-0...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728165</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Let's Encrypt's proposal to introduce short-lived certificates with a lifespan of just six days, along with the option for IP address certificates. This initiative aims to enhance security and privacy on the web by reducing the risks associated with long-lived certificates and enabling more flexible certificate issuance for services hosted on IP addresses. The proposal highlights the importance of making the web more secure while addressing challenges in certificate management and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kinda funny to call the current 90 day certs "long lived". When Let's Encrypted started out more than 10 years ago most certs from major vendors had a 1 year life span. Let's Encrypt was (one of) the first to use drastically shorter life spans, hence all the ACME automation effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP certs improve a niche but interesting use case for me. I run a domain registrar that implements a simple OAuth2 protocol[0] for delegating domains/subdomains. I also have an open source tunneling tool called boringproxy that implements the client side of this protocol[1].boringproxy needs to provide a callback redirect_uri to the oauth server in order to retrieve it's token, which it can then use for setting DNS records. However, it can't provide an HTTPS endpoint until it can set up those DNS records and get a cert. Chicken/egg. Currently the spec requires the server to implement a `GET /temp-domain` endpoint which creates a DNS record like 157-245-231-242.example.com which points at the client's IP. This lets boringproxy bootstrap a secure OAuth2 callback endpoint.IP certs would remove an entire step from this process.[0]: https://github.com/takingnames/namedrop-protocol-spec[1]: This is actually broken in boringproxy at the moment, but there's a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hf72-fYTts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember being surprised when Cloudflare launched https://1.1.1.1 with a valid cert and I immediately wanted one, but couldn’t find an easy way to get one.I am gonna try to run a DoH resolver on this and see how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726678</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long ago I worked on the firmware for a game controller. We started getting reports back of ghost inputs like stuck buttons and false presses after we sent some early hardware to media reviewers. Given the power of game media at the time, this was an immediate code red. We took shifts playtesting various video games for nearly a week straight just to try and replicate the issues. No luck, only the reviewers could manifest it. We were about to put reviewers on a plane to demonstrate the issue in person when I decided to clean my desk. In doing so I tossed a bare PCB running debug to the other side of the desk and my console went wild.Turns out the PCBs were shock/pressure sensitive, and the debouncing was just a bit off. Reviewers were getting really into their games and mechanically stressing the controllers. Stressed hard enough, the PCB would bend slightly, causing line level fluctuations and eventually ghost inputs. Back in the office we were just doing a job and not getting too emotionally involved in our playtesting.Some new molds and review units later we shipped the working system. Percussive debugging has solved a number of otherwise intractable bugs over my career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arguably, _The Jargon File_:http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.htmland _Zen and the Art of the Internet_https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34should be a part of the school curriculum covering the internet.While specific to the Mac, one wishes:https://folklore.org/0-index.htmlhttps://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40492.Revolution_in_T...was more widely read (and that it was updated with stories of turning OPENSTEP into Mac OS X), and if there is a similar site for Windows which collected stories such as:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-rev...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to track down an old story about the network not working in a firm on Wednesday morning near 7 am.I remember the details being that only on Wednesday did they use the freight elevator to deliver donuts to an all-staff meeting and when they did, the network would fritz.It turned out that if you move a very large electromagnet (on the elevator) along the network cable, it makes the network go crazy.Combine that with cable-pullers that rather than putting holes in multiple ceilings and floors in the cable closet, saw that the elevator shaft was a pre-existing hole between floors anyway, simply took the path of least resistance and hilarity (and a real hard network debugging problem) ensues.Does anyone know when or where this anecdote occurred ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42673766</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What’s unique about DBOS’s take on durable execution (compared to, say, Temporal) is that it’s implemented in a lightweight library that’s totally backed by Postgres. All you have to do to use DBOS is “npm install” it and annotate your program with decorators. The decorators store your program’s execution state in Postgres as it runs and recover it if it crashes. There are no other dependencies you have to manage, no separate workflow server–just your program and Postgres.this is good until you the postgres server fills up with load and need to scale up/fan out work to a bunch of workers? how do you handle that?(disclosure, former temporal employee, but also no hate meant, i'm all for making more good orcehstration choices)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could you genericise the requirement in postgresql and provide a storage interface we could plug into? I think I have a use for this in Polykey (https://GitHub.com/MatrixAI/Polykey) but we use rocksdb (transactional key value embedded db).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello!

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "What Every Hacker Should Know: TLB Invalidation" provides insights into the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and its critical role in memory management during hacking and exploitation scenarios. It explains the significance of TLB invalidation in mitigating certain attacks, particularly those that involve memory access patterns. The article outlines various techniques employed by hackers to manipulate memory and emphasizes the importance of understanding TLB behavior for both defending against and executing exploits. Additionally, it highlights the implications of TLB-related vulnerabilities on system security and offers recommendations for developers and security professionals to enhance their defenses against such threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation (not KVM) mode, the IMUL opcode still fails its IMUL opcode emulation after an XOR opcode (also within the same TLB cached page) modified its neighbor IMUL operand(s).TLB got double-invalidated yet some say never invalidated.  The crux is a glitch within a singlr entire TLB invalidation operation thereby negating XOR opcode's ability to self-modify the neighboring IMUL operand. (Double ROT13, anyone?). I assert double-invalidation because within the same TLB invalidation stroke, XOR operation got performed ... twice, as opposed to retrieving and restoring original IMUL operand value after such invalidation thereby negating XOR computed result EITHER WAY.A failure of self-modifying code within QEMU amd64/x86 emulation mode could be a useful test to determine if one is under QEMU emulation mode, of course if the page allows read-write-execute as often found in JavaScript, Java, Python and Dalvik (Android) bytecode memory regions.Fabrice Bellard, author of QEMU, acknowledged the basic of above but failed amd64/x86 IMUL/XOR self-modify premise in emulation (not KVM) mode of QEMU.https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/364&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd be interested to see this written for reading (as opposed to presenting).  Inferring the speaker's meaning from raw slides is a little challenging.  I've had to interact with the minutiae of the x86 TLB in a past life, but happily have forgotten most of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elaborate memory management (paging) systems need caching of lookups

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses OpenAI's failure to implement an opt-out system for photographers regarding the use of their images in training AI models. It highlights concerns from artists and photographers about the unauthorized use of their work and the lack of control they have over how their images are utilized by AI systems. The piece emphasizes the ongoing debate about copyright, ownership, and consent in the age of artificial intelligence, pointing out the need for clearer policies to protect creators' rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No way OpenAI will ever “good citizen” this. Tools to opt out of training sets will only come if they are legally compelled. Governments will have to make respecting some sort of training preference header on public content mandatory I think.The fact that photographers have to independently submit each piece of work they wanted excluded along with detailed descriptions just shows how much they DONT want anyone excluding content from their training data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't even understand why it's everyone elses problem to opt-out.Eventually - for how many of these AI companies would a person have to track down their opt-out processes just to protect their work from AI?  That's crazy.OpenAI should be contacting every single one and asking for permission - like everyone has to in order to use a person's work. How they are getting away with this is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s safe to assume anything Sam A says is an outright lie by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718850</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines a proposed framework for the diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across various sectors to enhance innovation and competitive advantage. It emphasizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders, including government, industry, and academia, to establish guidelines that ensure the ethical use and effective deployment of AI. The framework aims to address challenges related to AI adoption, such as data management, regulatory compliance, and workforce development, while promoting best practices and fostering a sustainable environment for AI advancements. Public comments are invited to refine and improve the framework before its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea if comments actually have any impact, but here is the comment I left on the document:I am Christopher Kanan, a professor and AI researcher at the University of Rochester with over 20 years of experience in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Previously, I led AI research and development at Paige, a medical AI company, where I worked on FDA-regulated AI systems for medical imaging. Based on this experience, I would like to provide feedback on the proposed export control regulations regarding compute thresholds for AI training, particularly models requiring 10^26 computational operations.The current regulation seems misguided for several reasons. First, it assumes that scaling models automatically leads to something dangerous. This is a flawed assumption, as simply increasing model size and compute does not necessarily result in harmful capabilities. Second, the 10^26 operations threshold appears to be based on what may be required to train future large language models using today’s methods. However, future advances in algorithms and architectures could significantly reduce the computational demands for training such models. It is unlikely that AI progress will remain tied to inefficient transformer-based models trained on massive datasets. Lastly, many companies trying to scale large language models beyond systems like GPT-4 have hit diminishing returns, shifting their focus to test-time compute. This involves using more compute to "think" about responses during inference rather than in model training, and the regulation does not address this trend at all.Even if future amendments try to address test-time compute, the proposed regulation seems premature. There are too many unknowns in future AI development to justify using a fixed compute-based threshold as a reliable indicator of potential risk. Instead of focusing on compute thresholds or model sizes, policymakers should focus on regulating specific high-risk AI applications, similar to how the FDA regulates AI software as a medical device. This approach targets the actual use of AI systems rather than their development, which is more aligned with addressing real-world risks.Without careful refinement, these rules risk stifling innovation, especially for small companies and academic researchers, while leaving important developments unregulated. I urge policymakers to engage with industry and academic experts to refocus regulations on specific applications rather than broadly targeting compute usage. AI regulation must evolve with the field to remain effective and balanced.---Of course, I have no skin in the game since I barely have any compute available to me as an academic, but the proposed rules on compute just don't make any sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most salient thing in the document is that it put export controls on releasing the weights of models trained with 10^26 operations. While there may be some errors in my math, I think that corresponds to training a model with over 70,000 H100s for a month.I personally think the regulation is misguided, as it assumes we won't identify better algorithms/architectures. There is no reason to assume that the level of compute leads to these problems.Moreover, given the emphasis on test-time compute nowadays and that it seems like a lot of companies have hit a wall with performance gains with trying to scale LLMs at train-time, I especially think this regulation isn't especially meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This smells a lot like the misguided crypto export laws in the 90s that hampered browser security for years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42730126</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex theories and scientific debates surrounding the origin of life on Earth, highlighting various hypotheses such as abiogenesis, the primordial soup theory, and the role of extremophiles. It discusses the challenges in replicating the conditions that led to the first life forms and the significance of recent discoveries in astrobiology and evolutionary biology. The piece emphasizes the ongoing quest to understand life’s beginnings, which remains one of science's most profound mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amino acids are common enough -- glycine has been found in comets and, controversially, even in the interstellar medium.  Other amino acids have also been found in comets.Comet organics, under pressure, can turn into amino acids in situ: https://www.llnl.gov/article/36016/amino-acids-could-be-prod...It's also presumed that cometary ice bombardment is the source of Earth's surface water, as ice or water present any earlier would have boiled off when the planet was young and hot.It's not much of a stretch to imagine that comets brought amino acids, organic compounds, and minerals to Earth as they were bringing water ice.  A lot of those aminos and organics would turn into tar, but some would be protected from UV radiation by that same tar.  With a heat source, maybe some lightning strikes, a good location, and a lot of luck, you get RNA...What we can't yet do is assign a probability or likelihood to this process.  But the ingredients should be common enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never like the emphasis on genetics and information in a lot of origin of life stuff. IMO it is too extensional; what is needed is good intensional reasoning.At the heart of chemical life is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis, this is a great intensional definition of the reproductive side. That just leaves the evolutionary side.What do "genetics" achieve for reproduction. From the autocatalysis point of view, they create a family of "nearby" autocatalytic sets: because different nucleic acid sequences reproduce in much the same way, the conditions needed to propagate one should also propogate another. This in turn makes safer mutations and....Lamarckian inheritance! If you, a microrganism get a good mutation which makes you fit, and then you split, you pass that mutation on.Genetics are sufficient for the above properties, but are they necessary? Probably not! We can probably find other things which have such a "dense/smooth mutation space" with fewer local maxima traps. Perhaps it is fine to say such things definitionally encode information, but IMO information still comes second, philosophically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meanings of both life and intelligence have been obscured by human conceit. We simply cannot accept that we came from what is essentially a random process over eons (which makes it no less extraordinary, but imo far more understandable). The science and math of LLMs and GPTs has been around for a while, but it took time and effort (people putting stuff online plus GPUs) to finally make it usable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42726539</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Ashburn, Virginia, has earned the title of the "Data Center Capital of the World" due to its strategic location, access to robust infrastructure, and a favorable regulatory environment. The area benefits from an abundance of fiber optic connectivity, reliable power sources, and proximity to major markets, making it an attractive hub for large tech companies and service providers. Additionally, with its tax incentives and a clustering of data centers, Ashburn has become a preferred site for enterprises looking to enhance their digital capabilities, further solidifying its dominance in the global data center landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We operate nearly 900 servers, and I believe the capital of cloud infrastructure is Amsterdam, NL. The concentration of ASNs in Amsterdam is incredible. In contrast, Ashburn, Dallas, and LA seem to lack ASN diversity, primarily being dominated by singular big tech companies. Cities like Amsterdam, Singapore, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Istanbul, and New York, however, have a greater concentration of smaller cloud hosting businesses, offering more diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real answer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAE-East&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked as a developer for an enterprise hosting company back in 2005.  I took servers out to Ashburn a couple of times.I had visited many data centers in Michigan but this place was at a completely different level.  High level of security and more cages than I had ever seen before.  It was like a little town with street signs so you could find your cage. Lots of logos of famous Internet companies.The fans were so loud my ears were ringing for hours afterward.  This was before the common use of hearing protection and I have no idea how people worked in there all day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42684128</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has announced the availability of Linux ARM64 hosted runners for free in public repositories, currently in public preview. This new feature allows developers to build and test their projects on ARM64 architecture, expanding the capabilities of GitHub Actions. Users can now utilize this functionality to enhance their CI/CD workflows, ensuring their applications run efficiently on ARM64 platforms. The update is a significant step towards improving accessibility and support for different architectures within the GitHub ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent news, as it should unblock having precompiled packages available for a number of applications for arm64—for me, most notably, OpenZFS: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14511&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a quick example I put together on how to use these runners to accelerate docker builds: https://github.com/gartnera/actions-arm64-native-example&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this is great, for people claiming they can now built multi-arch images without emulation, how are you planning on doing so? As far as I know, if you want to build multi-arch images on native runners for each platform, you basically need to:* Configure a workflow with 1 job for each arch, each building a standalone single-arch image, tagging it with a unique tag, and pushing each to your registry* Configure another job which runs at the completion of the previous jobs that creates a combined manifest containing each image using `docker manifest create`.Basically, doing the steps listed in https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-... under "The hard way with docker manifest
".Does anyone have a better approach, or some reusable workflows/GHA that make this process simpler? I know about Depot.dev which basically abstracts the runners away and handles all of this for you, but I don't see a good way to do this yourself without GitHub offering some better abstraction for building docker images.Edit: I just noticed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42729529 which has a great example of exactly these steps (and I just realized you can just push the digests, instead of tags too, which is nice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728015</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While thinking of making a game I’ve found these helpful:1. The Art of Game Design, A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell - https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design2. 20 Tips on Making Games by Jordan Mechner - https://www.jordanmechner.com/downloads/library/20tips.pdf3. Liz England’s blog - https://lizengland.com/blog/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons I got into software development was that I wanted to make some games (even just small ones that I release for free).I've now been coding for like 14 years, and I still haven't done it (besides a number of prototypes). And I'm so burnt out on writing code that I never have the mental energy to push through and get one done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think putting off polish for later as the OP and multiple comments here recommend is a fallacy. There are many popular, successful games that would just not be fun if they didn't have good animations, no effects and everything was boxes. Every game that relies on "feeling good to play". It might be fine for an RPG or an RTS, but it's probably not for something like Overwatch or Doom (the new ones). Just imagine Vampire Survivors without sound or effects. Some games live off the art style alone. This is a very controversional opinion, but I think if e.g. Ori and the Blind Forest had bad art, no one would have played the game. Some games you can evaluate really well with bad art and no juice or polish, other games need some and there are even games that need a lot of it, before you know if they can be fun. It's not that simple imho. I remember working on games that were not really fun until I added some effect and suddenly it was really addicting. People like flashing lights and noises and pretty pictures. If good, unique or interesting art was irrelevant, no one would invest in it, but people do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681545</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;A new laser technology has been developed that can measure vast distances with nanometre precision, significantly improving the accuracy of distance measurements in various fields such as space exploration, earth sciences, and engineering. This technique utilizes advanced laser systems to achieve unprecedented levels of precision, enabling scientists to gain better insights into the universe and enhance the capabilities of various technologies reliant on accurate distance measurements. The innovation demonstrates potential applications in improving the functionality of satellite navigation and mapping systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05542 :&gt; two-way dual-comb ranging (TWDCR) approach&gt; The advanced long-distance ranging technology is expected to have immediate implications for space research initiatives, such as the space telescope array and the satellite gravimetry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Vast" really shouldn't have been eliminated from the title, because interferometers have been measuring distances with nanometer precision since even before there were lasers, and lasers have been used in interferometers since the first laser in 01960.  Victorian-era interferometers, commonly used for grinding telescope mirrors, could only measure distances of a few meters with precision in the hundreds of nanometers.However, laser interferometers were already quite good; LIGO, most famously, detected gravitational waves by measuring strains of around 10⁻²⁰ over a distance of 1120 km, which works out to a change in distance of less than 0.000012 nanometers, much less than the width of a proton.The news here actually seems to be that "A new way to gauge distance using lasers can measure lengths of more than 100 kilometres ... To continue reading, subscribe today with our January sale."  So, uh, I don't know, maybe the reporter wasn't familiar with LIGO and thought that nanometer-precision interferometry over kilometers was new?  Sitkack, you say there's a paper somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am only two pages in, but I want to say this paper is very well written. People should give reading it a try reading (with LLM assistance).If this technique could be adapted to existing optical fiber infrastructure, we could see the effects of fiber optic cable stretch and deformation in realtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42693239</guid></item><item><title>44.

The entire org is very, very unhappy about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’ve been hammering us pretty hard, especially some folks in the leadership chain who worked with them before. While I have no direct beef with the product, the reality is that our Enterprise workload (and in fact, most Enterprise IT workloads in my experience) are VM-first, not container-first.My research conclusion at the time was that, while OpenShift is a great product worthy of consideration, it really only shines in organizations that are heavily invested in microservices or Kubernetes. If you (or more specifically, your vendors) haven’t migrated into that state, it’s not worth it compared to a RHEL server license and their KVM+Cockpit solution for bog standard VMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What're the FLOSS technologies underlying OpenShift?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Potoo, a family of nocturnal birds found in Central and South America, known for their distinctive appearance and behavior. They have large eyes, camouflaged plumage, and a unique call, which contributes to their mysterious reputation. The Potoos are primarily insectivorous and are notable for their cryptic roosting habits, often blending in perfectly with tree branches to avoid predators. Their conservation status varies, with some species facing threats due to habitat loss. The article also highlights various aspects of their biology, ecology, and cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;

The intention was to cause the announcer to say some funny words:&gt; It was 1989 through 1993. Saratoga, NY, not Sarasota Fla. The goal was to get the track announcer to call out: "...and it's All Pink on the inside!" In fact, it took three horses over about four years. The first horse, "All Pink" ran on the inside, but never got the call. "Ol Pink" ran too close to the rail, and jumped it, ending up on the infield. Finally a mare, "Awl Pink" got the call in late '93.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a ban on TikTok, citing national security concerns related to the app's Chinese ownership. It highlights the implications of the ruling on user privacy, potential impact on social media governance, and the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China regarding technology and data security. The decision is seen as a significant move in the broader context of regulating foreign-owned tech companies operating in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is going to be an interesting experiment:
A widely used social network across the world WITHOUT american content.Until now, the closest thing we had like this were national our regional networks like Russia's vk, but Vk was never truly popular outside Russian speaking countries.Now we, for the first time ever, will have the situation where a social network has global reach but without american content.Will it keep being a english first space? Will it survive/thrive? How the content is going to evolve? What does this means in terms of global cultural influence? Will we see internationalized Chinese content dominating it? Will this backfire for the US?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone here who's not a TikTok content creator reasonably upset about losing access to the platform? Can you tell me why it will sting for you? I was really surprised that my daughters (avid teenage TikTok users) are much more relieved than mad. Both said they wasted too much time on TikTok and were hoping life will now feel better. Seems the very thing that made the platform sticky puts it in a guilty pleasure category perhaps.(I'm asking about the lived experience outside of the political questions around who should decide what we see / access online.)EDIT: Thank you for the replies! Interesting. I'm still wondering if most people use TikTok just for passive entertainment? I don't love Youtube, but it's been a huge learning and music discovery resource for me.The only thing I get sent from TikTok are dances and silly memes but I don't have an account.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the easiest answer to follow for "why is this not prevented by free speech protection" is "the fact that petitioners “cannot avoid or mitigate” the effects of the Act by altering their speech." (page 10 of this ruling, but is a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_In...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738464</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing challenges in the insurance industry, highlighting how rising risks associated with climate change, economic instability, and other global crises are making it difficult for insurers to manage and price coverage. It argues that as the frequency and severity of catastrophic events grow, many risks may become uninsurable, leading to significant implications for individuals and businesses reliant on insurance for protection. The author emphasizes the need for a reevaluation of risk management practices and potential shifts in societal approaches to resilience and risk-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;American, living in area prone to natural disasters: "Is the WHOLE WORLD becoming uninsurable?"The answer is obviously "no" since there are other parts of the world that don't live on a hurricane highway nor build houses made from firewood in an area prone to wildfires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not uninsurable, but buildings are going to have to become tougher.It's happened before. Chicago's reaction to the Great Fire was simple - no more building wooden houses. Chicago went all brick. Still is, mostly.The trouble is, brick isn't earthquake resistant. Not without steel reinforcement.I live in a house built of cinder block filled with concrete reinforced with steel. A commercial builder built this as his personal residence in 1950. The walls look like a commercial building. The outside is just painted cinder block. Works fine, survived the 1989 earthquake without damage, low maintenance. It's not what most people want today in the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like we see in California, when the government sets a price ceiling, insurance companies just leave.  Same in Florida.  If the free market truly was allowed run normally, the insurance rates in Pacific Palisades or on the Florida coast would be so high that no one could afford to live there.  Is that a bad thing?  If someone was living in a house near where they tested missiles, we'd call them crazy.  At what point can we say the same about people building and rebuilding over and over in these disaster areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732728</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL Anonymizer is a tool designed to facilitate data anonymization for PostgreSQL databases. It aims to help organizations comply with data protection regulations by providing methods to transform sensitive data into a format that preserves its usability for testing and analysis while protecting individual privacy. The documentation covers installation procedures, usage instructions, and configuration options, along with examples and guidelines for customizing the anonymization process to suit specific needs. It emphasizes ease of use and flexibility in handling various data types and structures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clickhouse has something similar called clickhouse-obfuscator [1]. It even works offline with data dumps so you can quickly prepare and send somewhat realistic example data to others.According to its --help output, it is designed to retain the following properties of data:- cardinalities of values (number of distinct values) for every column and for every tuple of columns;- conditional cardinalities: number of distinct values of one column under condition on value of another column;- probability distributions of absolute value of integers; sign of signed integers; exponent and sign for floats;- probability distributions of length of strings;- probability of zero values of numbers; empty strings and arrays, NULLs;- data compression ratio when compressed with LZ77 and entropy family of codecs;- continuity (magnitude of difference) of time values across table; continuity of floating point values.- date component of DateTime values;- UTF-8 validity of string values;- string values continue to look somewhat natural[1]: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhou...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have some experience with the 'Masking Views' functionality. If you are going to rely on it and specifically in a Rails app, know that it is against conventions and thus is generally inconvenient. This may be the same with any other framework that features DB schema migrations.More specifically the integration of this functionality at a fortunately ex-employer was purposefully kept away from the dev team (no motivation was offered, however I suspect that some sort of segmentation was sought after) and thus did not take into account that tables with PII did in fact still need their schema changed from time to time.This lead to the anonymizer extension, together with the confidential views to only be installed on production DB instances with dev, test, and staging instances running vanilla postgres. With this, the possibility to catch DB migration issues related to the confidential views was pushed out to the release itself. This lead to numerous failed releases which involved having the ops team intervene, manually remove the views for the duration of the release, then manually re-create them.So,If you plan to use this extension, and specifically its views, make sure you have it set up in the exactly same way on all environments. Also make sure that its initialisation and view creation are part of your framework's DB migrations so that they are documented and easy to precisely reproduce on new environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the best ways to handle this sort of thing is to put things like PII in a separate database entirely and replace it with a token in the "main" database.  When something like PII actually needs to be retrieved you first retrieve the token and then search the other database for said token to get the real data.It certainly complicates things but it provides an additional security layer of separation between the PII and it's related data.  You can provide your end users access to a database without having to worry about them getting access to the "dangerous" data.  If they do indeed need access to the data pointed to via the token they can request access to that related database.This method also provides more performance since you don't need to encrypt the entire database (which is often required when storing PII) and also don't need to add extra security context function calls to every database request.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694732</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconception that the Canon 6299 camera can be used as a webcam without additional equipment or software. It explains that while some cameras can work for this purpose with appropriate tools, the Canon 6299 does not support direct USB webcam functionality. The author emphasizes the importance of using specific capture cards or streaming software to enable this capability and provides alternative solutions for users looking to livestream or video chat using DSLR technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also discovered that I couldn't use my Canon SLR to record more than 30 minutes of video continuously.The problem however wasn't Canon, but that I lived in a region (EU) that would have imposed a customs tariff on cameras that could do that, but by keeping it under that, the camera would be classed as a 'stills' camera and so was therefore exempt.Admittedly this is different from the case in the article - but it would appear that owning something that could physically do what you want it to is only half the battle for numerous reasons, and in this case it would have been my government demanding extra money to 'unlock' this functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's reminds me when I was in South East Asia a few years back and wanted to do some time lapse or series photography with my Sony Alpha a7ii. A camera that I had paid close to 2k€ for (just body, no glass).It required an app to be installed on the camera that was paid-for. Which in term required the camera to be connected to a WiFi.Imagine discovering this while on a trip in the jungle or the desert or whatever ...It was a one time purchase (I think around 10€) but it was still a complete wtf.You had to purchase the app through the camera's app store. You read right.Ofc this failed as my CC was declined because I live in Germany and the transaction got marked as suspicious, coming from SEA.So I had to go to town and hunt down a wifi USB dongle so I could turn my laptop into a WiFi hotspot for the camera, while using the VPN masking the built-in WiFi to be connected to a German IP.You had to enter the CC details through the camera's on-screen keyboard that was operated with the joystick on the camera's body. It took me a good ten minutes.No words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The penny-fucking behaviour of huge organization in parallel of pushing at you unwanted (actually obstructing) messages in various ways, email, pop-ups and tootip suggestions and advices, CI/CD pushed on the user on a prominent way are repelling. In parallel to the rubbish web presence not working reliably or at all, far from being easy for clients but usually having bells and whistles for distraction. I saved quite a bit of money thinking twice if I want to be abused by products made for the benefit of the organization mainly. Sometimes with side benefits for the user, but that is more like coincidence, side effect of addressing the organization's needs. Less and less point buying consumer products if it just makes your life similarly difficult, not better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42735393</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long before UKI was a thing, this kind of attack was prevented by hardcoding into an EFI stub kernel the sha512 hash of a trusted initrd that would verify the cryptographic authenticity of the initrd that did the "heavy lifting" (mounting disks etc).We have had not just secure boot but had it better on Linux (and other Unix-like) systems for a very long time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On my system, I used `tpm2-measure-pcr=yes` in `/etc/crypttab.initramfs`, then used `--tpm2-pcrs=0+2+7+15:sha256=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with `systemd-cryptenroll`.As soon as a volume is decrypted, initrd will write `volume-key` to PCR 15, so any further executables can no longer access the data stored in the TPM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I first read about TPM-based FDE on Linux[0], I was excited that the systemd guys were finally taking a step in the right direction - BitLocker/FileVault were standard on Windows/macOS for a long time by that point. FDE should be secure by default, dead-simple to set up (e.g. a checkbox in the installer that defaults to "enabled"), and painless for everyday use.[0]: https://0pointer.de/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.htmlThen I read about the implementation details[0], and it's a complex bloody mess with an unending chain of brittle steps and edge cases, that are begging for a mistake and get exploited. So here we are.I'm convinced that "measure the kernel" into "measure the initrd" into "show login screen" is all it should take.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42733640</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an fun read, as someone who's both a Korean BW player and a speech recognition researcher.It's interesting to note that the original Korean transcription already has many errors, seemingly (and impressively) corrected by LLMs later on. For example, 12 안마당 빌드 (12 courtyard build) is actually 12 앞마당 빌드 (12 frontyard build), which might have been more understandable to BW players. Similarly 투에처리 빌드 (processing-at-two build? makes no sense lol) should have been transcribed 투해처리 빌드 (two-Hatchery build).Therefore it may also be helpful to directly feed the slang dictionary into Whisper's inference process using contextual biasing. There are lots of ways to do this, but the simplest would be to increase the probability of slang words in the dictionary in the final prediction layer of Whisper by a constant factor. This is fairly easy to implement, for example by using HuggingFace's library: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/internal/generat...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t let the title fool you: this is anextremely thorough and creative take on translating and making more approachable the commentary of StarCraft.As the author rightly points out, in its 27 years of existence, commentary around the game has become a domain specific language. Not just Korean or English.This approach of automated scripting and using AI to understand roughly what was said and then make it coherent is really cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LOL, as a non-native English speaker, reading this reminds me of EXACTLY the same problem of translating many things, but more precisely, computer articles and software development.There’s a huge amount of terms that are difficult to translate (sharding? Hash?). The only real solution is to adopt them to your language, more or less adapted, which is what happens over time. But it requires a community that, to some degree, is able to cross the gap between the languages. In this case, learning English.Talking about software development in Spanish (my native language) is a succession of imported terms from English.I don’t think there’s a good way of doing that, and I’m interested to see how automatic translations deal with it, because the only way this can work is with a process of mixing both language in a social way and see what terms evolve from that process.And you need, in the terms the post describes, people that know Korean at least in a non-fluent way. And the game itself, of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42740596</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi all, I'm Dominic and I'm on the product team at Mermaid. I enjoyed reading a lot of your feedback!It seems there's several good ideas and thoughts on the direction of the platform that we'd love to learn more about. If you have problems with the current product, improvement requests, or would like to chat then let's connect! Please email me at dominic@mermaidchart.com or book time on my calendar: (https://calendly.com/dominic-01w/mermaid-shapers-product-int...)Thanks for taking a look at our latest release!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent some time playing around with this recently and loved it at first. I also realized ChatGPT is pretty good at generating Mermaid diagrams (didn't try your own AI features).However after getting into it some I ran into some significant frustrations. After creating a medium-complexity diagram, I was excited to see the Whiteboard feature to drag things around / improve the layout manually. But it really started breaking, it just wouldn't let me organize/drag things where I wanted, and I couldn't get things to not overlap. I also wished more diagram types supported Whiteboard (I noticed some didn't).Also I some confusion between the capabilities of mermaidchart.com and mermaid.live. Are these competitors? Variations of similar apps. I was confused. Also "Playground" vs "Live Editor" is confusing.Overall glad this exists and hope it continues to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only use diagramming tools with automatic layout algos to generate visualizations programmatically to debug things. For documentation purpose, I largely prefer to draw them by hand using OmniGraffle, because making graphs look nice using tools like graphviz is very complex and you find yourself abusing features to hack your vision into realityWhat's dearly needed in my opinion is a graph layout algo based on a machine learning model (so that it can take into account readability and aesthetics). Unfortunately what I found so far is mostly concerned with displaying large graphs, which is kind of another domain altogether.I hope Mermaid is collecting every single edition point that happens on their UI, that would make for a nice dataset I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738656</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" presents research on how large language models, such as GPT-3, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities without the need for task-specific training. The study explores their performance on various reasoning benchmarks, showing that these models can effectively generate correct responses to novel tasks by leveraging their extensive training on vast text datasets. The authors analyze the models' zero-shot reasoning abilities, highlighting the implications for artificial intelligence and the potential for future developments in understanding and improving reasoning in language models.&lt;/p&gt;

I like the idea of a meta-mechanism that learns to update an associative memory based on how surprising the data is. The other stuff, reading memory via keys and values and selectively erasing it with gating, look pretty conventional on a first glance. Thank you for sharing this on HN. I've added it to my reading list.EDIT: I'm reminded of this other type of associative memory: https://github.com/glassroom/heinsen_routing. The idea there is to compute a mixture of memories that best predicts the given input sequence. Quite frankly, I don't remember how the whole thing works, but I do remember that it works. It's been a while since I used it, so YMMV. In any case, it may be of interest to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688392</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;A professor at UC Santa Cruz, Gary Rendsburg, has made a significant archaeological discovery by unearthing what is believed to be the oldest alphabet known to date, dating back to around 1800 to 1500 BCE. This finding, derived from inscriptions in ancient Semitic script, provides crucial insights into the development of written language and its evolution. Rendsburg's research highlights the connection between the ancient alphabet and the origins of Hebrew and Arabic scripts, underscoring the importance of this discovery in understanding the historical context of language development.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember having very different emotional responses to faculty members as a student. Schwartz struck me as elegant, diffident, blue-blooded, and completely disinterested in teaching a bunch of young morons who were just taking the course as a distribution requirement. I'm glad to see that he and his former students are an influential force in this area of study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope we will get much more research like this, now when Syria is liberated and has Democratic governors!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42689054</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on end-to-end encryption. It explores how advancements in AI technologies can intersect with encryption practices, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and privacy concerns that may arise. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong encryption in the face of evolving AI capabilities, suggesting that while AI can enhance security measures, it can also pose threats if used maliciously. The piece advocates for a balanced approach to integrating AI with cryptographic systems to safeguard user privacy and data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You might even convince yourself that these questions are “privacy preserving,” since no human police officer would ever rummage through your papers, and law enforcement would only learn the answer if you were (probably) doing something illegal.Something I've started to see happen but never mentioned is the effect automated detection has on systems: As detection becomes more automated (previously authored algorithms, now with large AI models), there's less cash available for individual case workers, and more trust at the managerial level on automatic detection. This leads to false positives turning into major frustrations since it's hard to get in touch with a person to resolve the issue. When dealing with businesses it's frustrating, but as these get more used in law enforcement, this could be life ruining.For instance - I got flagged as illegal reviews on Amazon years ago and spent months trying to make my case to a human. Every year or so I try to raise the issue again to leave reviews, but it gets nowhere. Imagine this happening for a serious criminal issue, with the years long back log on some courts, this could ruin someones life.More automatic detection can work (and honestly, it's inevitable) but it's got to acknowledge that false positives will happen and allocate enough people to resolve those issues. As it stands right now, these detection systems get built and immediately human case workers get laid off, there's this assumption that detection systems REPLACE humans, but it should be that they augment and focus human case workers so you can do more with less - the human aspect needs to be included in the budgeting.But the incentives aren't there, and the people making the decisions aren't the ones working the actual cases so they aren't confronted with the problem. For them, the question is why save $1m when you could save $2m? With large AI models making it easier and more effective to build automated detection I expect this problem to get significantly worse over the next years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Yet this approach is obviously much better than what’s being done at companies like OpenAI, where the data is processed by servers that employees (presumably) can log into and access.No need for presumption here: OpenAI is quite transparent about the fact that they retain data for 30 days and have employees and third-party contractors look at it.https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data&gt; To help identify abuse, API data may be retained for up to 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law).https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/&gt; Our access to API business data stored on our systems is limited to (1) authorized employees that require access for engineering support, investigating potential platform abuse, and legal compliance and (2) specialized third-party contractors who are bound by confidentiality and security obligations, solely to review for abuse and misuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; We are about to face many hard questions about these systems, including some difficult questions about whether they will actually be working for us at all.And how. I'd lean towards no. Where we're headed feels like XKEYSCORE on steroids. I'd love to take the positive, optimistic bent on this, but when you look at where we've been combined with the behavior of the people in charge of these systems (to be clear, not the researchers or engineers, but c-suite), hope of a neutral, privacy-first future seems limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734478</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a "standards-first" web framework that prioritizes adherence to web standards over proprietary solutions. It emphasizes the importance of building applications that are accessible, maintainable, and perform well across different browsers and devices. The framework encourages developers to utilize native web technologies and practices to enhance compatibility and longevity of their projects. By adopting a standards-first approach, the article argues that developers can create more robust and user-friendly web applications that align with the evolving web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is interesting, but I really dislike the way it tries to bash every other tech in the blog post, on the homepage and in the docs itself. The tone is very confident, but it will put you open to a lot of scrutiny.Instead it could really use a lot more explanation on how it works. If you make comparisons make sure they are fair. The image "JavaScript mixed together" and "Strict separation of concerns" is just comparing apples with oranges. Multiple times in the docs it compares a huge complicated JSX like component and replaces it with 3 lines of html and 3 lines of css. I don't believe that it does the same thing.Some of the claims are strange. It praises standard HTML but apparently you have to use some custom Markdown syntax to write it. How does that add up? And on top of that it also introduces new syntax for loops and variables.This could all work perfectly fine. But my suggestion would be to talk more about how it works and what are the advantages and less trying to bring down competitors. It could use less grand claims and focus more on what it really does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I help maintain Lit[1], which I consider a very standards-first non-framework.With Lit you can build full apps with standard and plain JS, CSS, and HTML; standard web components; and no build tools.I don't immediately see how this is any more standards-first, especially when it mentions Markdown, tooling, and a CLI. I don't actually really see what exactly this even is from this landing page. It would help to show something up front.[1]: https://lit.dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I just getting more grumpy in my old age or is every new framework just complete bloat ?I wanted to give it a try, but I need to install bun, a new js runtime, okay fine, why not. Javascript needs more runtimes after all.Then I need to install `nuekit`.. globally.. Okay...Now I need to run an obscure command 'nue; which I didn't know I installed.
`nue create simple-blog`Then it tells me to follow the tutorial docs, great. But I need to start writing YAML.. Losing patience now.My relief comes when I see :&gt; Nue is not currently tested or developed under Windows, so use it at your own risk.Well I guess as a Windows user I can't have a 'Standards First Web Framework'.Think I'll stick to what actually works instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42722855</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the complex relationship between French Modernist artists and the mass media that emerged in their time. It examines how figures like Marcel Duchamp and André Breton both critiqued and utilized the technologies of mass communication, reflecting a dual sentiment of disdain and fascination. The piece highlights the tension between their avant-garde aspirations and the commercial realities of media culture, showcasing how these artists navigated the rapidly changing landscape of their era while grappling with the impact of mass media on art and society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In the 1860s, Charles Baudelaire bemoaned what we might now call doomscrolling:
[...]
The poet’s revulsion was widely shared in 19th-century France. Amid rapid increases in circulation, newspapers were depicted as a virus or narcotic responsible for collective neurosis, overexcitement and lowered productivity.On one hand, one could think "oh, the current social network bashing is just the same doom and gloom reaction to more communication, it will pass".On the other hand, if you know well the period, the newspapers of the time - which were closer to the tabloids of today, but worse - did a lot to stir hatred of foreigners, of Jews, of Poor, and contributed massively in causing wars, colonialism and pogroms.Emile Zola published "J'accuse !" in a newspaper, but it was newspapers who stirred rabid antisemitism everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The internet and its associated gadgets stir reactions remarkably like those once directed at the press. In some quarters, futurist technophilia; more commonly, alarm at the social, political and cultural impact of these innovations, combined with neurotic dependence upon them.Note that the article is not taking the simplistic position that, because 19th century French writers decried the emergence of the newspaper, and 21st century contemporary thinkers decry the dominance of social media, that the latter should be dismissed. It's more nuanced than that, and it's really mostly an accounting of how those Modernists thought about newspapers, with a little bit of "let's consider a modern example..." at the end.One thing I'd like to point out, though, is that very common argument by which one waves away concerns about social media today because, in the past, Socrates said reading is bad, and Mallarmé said newspapers are bad, is really a canard for two reasons.First, because the social media is not reading, or newspapers, it's a different thing altogether, and in any case what happened in the past does not strictly determine a new case in the present or the future.Second, because I'm fairly certain Mallarmé and Proust and Baudelaire would probably look at the world newspapers created, and say "I was right about newspapers all along". It did create yellow journalism, it did create tabloids, it did redefine truth, and recalibrate leisure, and it did create doomscrolling, and make people think in different—and not necessarily better—ways. Technology changes the world, and people adapt to it. After the fact of that change, the world normalizes, and new generations can't conceive of any prior alternative way of being. But, that does not mean the change was an improvement.As a consequence, it may be categorically incorrect for us to even try to evaluate these historical positions from our modern perch. Maybe all we can do is listen to what people living through that change said, and take it as read, pun intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They weren’t wrong, the people controlling the media, whether that be the owner of the newscompany or the owner of the algorithm that influences what newscompany gets recommended prefers it when the reader gets recommended criticism of others based on race or other indignificant things instead of riches, cause they are the people with riches.It’s not a coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42739572</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article on dark patterns in games discusses manipulative design techniques used by game developers to influence player behavior, often leading to undesirable outcomes like unintentional purchases or excessive playtime. It explores various types of dark patterns, provides examples from different games, and emphasizes the ethical considerations and negative impact these practices can have on players. The goal is to raise awareness about these tactics and encourage a more transparent and fair gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool idea, pretty good execution, but your UI is confusing.1. There's so much happening on the screen between your app's UI and the fake UI with the dark patterns that it's confusing. IMO you should show the objective first, and then let the user click to reveal the fake UI and challenge. For example, simply show, "Challenge #1 — Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription." Then have a button that says, "Start Challenge." When that button is clicked, then reveal the UI.2. Give me some context. If you just say, "Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription," that's not really enough. You should set the scenario. "Imagine you're subscribed to an app, but you don't want to be subscribed anymore. So you sign into the app and click the cancel button. It loads a new screen. How do proceed from here to finalize your cancelation?"3. Don't tell me the answer in advance. Naming the first challenge "Color Confusion" tells me the answer.4. Don't auto-advance steps. I had no idea that I auto advanced. I changed tabs, then came back, then was scrolling down looking for the next step button. Just let me manually click to the next step as a user. Preferably at the bottom, near the pattern explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a nice game but I have some feedback:The first two levels want you to click the non-misleading option and then the third requires you to click the misleading option, which then has a "Report as Deceptive Marketing" button. This feels counterproductive if you're trying to teach people to not fall for dark patterns, you've just rewarded them for falling for it and punished anyone who didn't!. Then, a later level has the opposite, you see (almost) the same dialog from level 3, but you need to click the other option.The instructions for Level 3 do say you're supposed to "find the hidden truth", but that's not necessarily what clicking the "Activate Premium Features" button would do in real life. I think it would work better if it stuck to one side of things, probably having players always try to avoid getting misled. At the end it says one of the outcomes should be "Improved muscle memory", so the goal should probably be no clicking on bad things.This also makes it confusing what it's supposed to be simulating to me. I've never had a site offer to let me report their own promotions as deceptive (or as a later level has, "Report Bait and Switch Tactic" when you go to check out).The "Trick Questions" level had only pre-checked checkboxes that you should uncheck (and the button tells you to uncheck all of them, there's no thought required here), I think it would work better if some needed to remain checked. It ties in to the same "muscle memory" issue, unchecking isn't guaranteed to be a good action. Similarly, it might make sense to have Basket Sneaking include a coupon code or something that you shouldn't remove from your cart, so players learn to read closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  I wish to opt out of receiving exclusive promotional offers and updates about products I might be interested in.

  What this means:
  When checked: They will send you marketing emails. Uncheck to stop promotional emails.

  How it tricks you:
  They use 'opt out' and 'wish' to create a double negative - saying no to opting out means saying yes to emails

Fun stuff! But I'm really unclear about this particular checkbox on lesson 9 - in my eyes, wishing is not a negative - so this is a single negative, and you would check it to not receive updates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737778</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article investigates a malicious RJ45 dongle designed to compromise network security. It details the author's examination of the device, revealing its capabilities to intercept and manipulate network traffic. The investigation uncovers how the dongle can exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, making it a serious threat to device integrity and data privacy. The author emphasizes the importance of being cautious with hardware, particularly unverified devices, and raises awareness about potential security risks in everyday technology usage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The English-language product brief implies that “SR” stands for “Supereal”; that brand name comes up in the context of counterfeit FTDI FT232RL chips that plagued the industry some time ago.This wording is misleading because it implies the fake chips were the plague. The fake chips worked fine, and it was FTDI's official driver that intentionally ruined peoples' working hardware when they detected the fakes and changed their PID to 0000 so they would no longer be recognized: http://www.rei-labs.net/changing-ftdi-pid/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If you want to try it, be aware that it requires Intel Pentium 166MHz or above."Made me laugh. Fun article, also really love the genre of "bored smart person goes too deep on something that the end result is obvious by common sense but proving it requires surprising amount of ingenuity and scrappiness"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came across the tweet about this "Evil" dongle and instantly recognized it as the exact same thing I worked on before... It's not evil, it's just annoying.https://blog.brixit.nl/making-a-usb-ethernet-adapter-work-sr...In my case I disabled the SPI flash module to have it not appear as a CD drive, the author of this post actually found some documentation about the SPI being optional. Funnily enough this post now also gives you all the tooling to make an actual evil RJ45 dongle by reflashing one :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743033</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the initial steps and considerations involved in building a data center, highlighting key factors such as site selection, space requirements, and infrastructure planning. It emphasizes the importance of scalability, energy efficiency, and redundancy in design to ensure reliable operations. Additionally, the piece discusses the technological and environmental factors that must be taken into account to support the center's long-term viability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would you call colocation "building your own data center"? You could call it "colocation" or "renting space in a data center". What are you building? You're racking. Can you say what you mean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the old Rackspace days! Boy we had some war stories:   - Some EMC guys came to install a storage device for us to test... and tripped over each other and knocked out an entire Rack of servers like a comedy skit. (They uh... didn't win the contract.)
   - Some poor guy driving a truck had a heart attack and the crash took our DFW datecenter offline. (There were ballards to prevent this sort of scenario, but the cement hadn't been poured in them yet.)
   - At one point we temporarily laser-beamed bandwidth across the street to another building
   - There was one day we knocked out windows and purchased box fans because servers were literally catching on fire.

Data center science has... well improved since the earlier days. We worked with Facebook on the OpenCompute Project that had some very forward looking infra concepts at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess there's another in-between step buying your own hardware, even when merely "leasing individual racks", and EC2 instances: dedicated bare metal providers like Hetzner.This lets one get closer to the metal (e.g. all your data is on your specific disk, rather than an abstracted block storage, such as EBS, not shared with other users, cheaper, etc) without having to worry about the staff that installs the hardware or where/how it fits in a rack.For us, this was a way to get 6x performance for 1/6 of the cost. (Excluding, of course our time, but we enjoyed it!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743019</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Doubleclickjacking: What Is It and How to Protect Yourself" explains the concept of doubleclickjacking, a method used by malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in browser settings and ad networks to display unauthorized advertisements on websites. It outlines how attackers can manipulate legitimate ad services, causing users to inadvertently click on ads that lead to phishing sites or malware. The article also provides guidance on how individuals and website owners can protect themselves from such attacks, including using ad blockers, ensuring up-to-date software, and maintaining awareness of online security practices.&lt;/p&gt;

The demo UI of "Double click here" isn't very convincing - I bet there's a version of this that gets people to double click consistently though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea here is simple: get users to commit to clicking twice, but the pop up page only accepts a single click before closing. Their second click goes to the page underneath the pop up, which is e.g. an authentication button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42693748</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of graphics in NetBSD without relying on the X11 system. It reviews alternative graphical frameworks, highlighting the potential for using graphics libraries that enable more direct access to hardware and improved performance. The author shares insights on the benefits of this approach, including simplicity and reduced resource consumption, while also covering practical use cases and examples of applications that run effectively under this setup. The piece emphasizes the growing trend towards lightweight, more efficient graphical solutions in modern operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These interfaces can be cute to play with, but there's a reason that fbdev is deprecated on Linux - it's not a good interface outside toy examples. wscons may be more powerful, but I don't think it can be used to fully enable modern accelerated display devices, although do correct me if I'm wrong.Despite some confusion in terminology, modern interfaces also operate on frame buffers, but with an API for switching them out atomically. Likewise, your display server (at least modern ones) just take your client window as a completed frame buffer, and mainly serve to let multiple applications all show their frame buffers without having to worry about what other applications are doing. Frame buffers all the way down, just with support for DMA, atomicity, fancy formats and color spaces, etc.You can use the appropriate modern APIs to make a single, exclusive graphical application with all the benefits of modern display hardware easily enough. That is, after all, what your display server is. You just don't gain much - just a little bit of saved sideband IPC.X11 makes it seem like a display server is a complicated thing that has to support drawing and what not, but with alternatives like Wayland, a full screen client buffer is handed off zero-copy from the client application tot he hardware without being looked at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a parallel note, this brought memories of SVGALib.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVGALib&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for encoding UTF-8 strings that avoids the overhead of branching operations, which can improve performance in certain applications. It explains the challenges and inefficiencies associated with traditional UTF-8 encoding due to conditional statements and presents a branchless approach using bit manipulation and mathematical operations. The author provides a detailed breakdown of the encoding process, accompanied by code examples, to demonstrate how this method can be implemented effectively while maintaining compatibility with standard UTF-8. Overall, the piece emphasizes the benefits of optimizing UTF-8 encoding for high-performance scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742184"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incidentally, this automatic branch-if-zero from LLVM is being improved.First of all, a recent LLVM patch apparently changes codegen to use CMOV instead of a branch:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/102885Beyond that, Intel recently updated their manual to retroactively define the behavior of BSR/BSF on zero inputs: it leaves the destination register unmodified.  This matches the AMD manual, and I suspect it matches the behavior of all existing x86-64 processors (but that will need to be tested, I guess).If so, you don't need either a branch or CMOV.  Just set a register to 32, then run BSR with the same register as destination.  If the BSR input is nonzero, the 32 is overwritten with the trailing-zero count.  If the BSR input is zero, then BSR leaves the register unmodified and you get 32.Since this behavior is now guaranteed for future x86-64 processors, and assuming it's indeed compatible with all existing x86-64 processors (maybe even all x86 processors period?), LLVM will no longer need the old path regardless of what it's targeting.Note that if you're targeting a newer x86-64 version, LLVM will just emit TZCNT, which just does what you'd expect and returns 32 if the input is zero (or 64 for a 64-bit TZCNT).  But as the blog post demonstrates, many people still build for baseline x86_64.(Intel does document one discrepancy between processors: "On some older processors, use of a 32-bit operand size may clear the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit destination while leaving the lower 32 bits unmodified.")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have access to the BMI2 instruction set I can do branchless UTF-8 encoding like in the article using only 9 instructions and 73 bytes of lookup tables:    branchless_utf8:
        mov     rax, rdi
        lzcnt   ecx, esi
        lea     rdx, [rip + .L__unnamed_1]
        movzx   ecx, byte ptr [rcx + rdx]
        lea     rdx, [rip + example::DEP_AND_OR::h78cbe1dc7fe823a9]
        pdep    esi, esi, dword ptr [rdx + 8*rcx]
        or      esi, dword ptr [rdx + 8*rcx + 4]
        movbe   dword ptr [rdi], esi
        mov     qword ptr [rdi + 8], rcx
        ret


The code:    static DEP_AND_OR: [(u32, u32); 5] = [
        (0, 0),
        (0b01111111_00000000_00000000_00000000, 0b00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000),

    ];

    const LEN: [u8; 33] = [
        // 0-10 leading zeros: not valid.
        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

        // 21-24 leading zeros: 2 bytes.
        2, 2, 2, 2,
        // 25-32 leading zeros: 1 byte.
        1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
    ];

    pub unsafe fn branchless_utf8(codepoint: u32) -&gt; ([u8; 4], usize) {
        let leading_zeros = codepoint.leading_zeros() as usize;
        let bytes = LEN[leading_zeros] as usize;
        let (mask, or) = *DEP_AND_OR.get_unchecked(bytes);
        let ret = core::arch::x86_64::_pdep_u32(codepoint, mask) | or;
        (ret.swap_bytes().to_le_bytes(), bytes)
    }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  /// Encode a UTF-8 codepoint.
  /// […]
  /// Returns a length of zero for invalid codepoints (surrogates and out-of-bounds values);
  /// it's up to the caller to turn that into U+FFFD, or return an error.

It's not a "UTF-8 codepoint", that's horridly mangling the terminology. Code points are just code points.The input to a UTF-8 encode is a scalar value, not a code point, and encoding a scalar value is infallible. What doubly kills me is that Rust has a dedicated type for scalar values. (`char`.)(In languages with non-[USV]-strings…, Python raises an exception, JS emits garbage.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742184</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations and challenges associated with the CIELAB color space, specifically in terms of its representation of perceptual brightness. It highlights that while CIELAB aims to create a uniform color space based on human vision, it does not account for variations in brightness perception effectively across different colors. The author examines several issues, including the non-linear response of the human eye to brightness and how this can lead to inaccuracies when using CIELAB for color manipulation in design and imaging applications. The discussion emphasizes the need for improved models that better align with human perception to aid in color representation and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always found these "perceptual vs absolute" things about human senses very interesting.Hearing has a few quirks too:- When we measure sound pressure, we measure it in log (so, every 3dB is a doubling in sound pressure), but our hearing perceives this as a linear scale. If you make a linear volume slide, the upper part will seem as if it barely does anything.- The lower the volume, the less perceivable upper and lower ranges are compared to the midrange. This is what "loudness" intends to fix, although poor implementations have made many people assume it is a V-curve button. A proper loudness implementation will lessen its impact as volume increases, completely petering off somewhere around 33% of maximum volume.- For the most "natural" perceived sound, you don't try to get as flat a frequency response as possible but instead aim for a Harman curve.- Bass frequencies (&lt;110Hz, depending on who you ask) are omnidirectional, which means we cannot accurately perceive which direction the sound is coming from. Subwoofers exploit this fact, making it seem as if deep rich bass is coming from your puny soundbar and not the sub hidden behind the couch :).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is part of "tone mapping"[1] in high dynamic range rendering. The idea is that pixels are computed with a much larger range of values than screens can display. 16 bits per color per pixel, or even a floating point value. Then, to generate the displayed image, there's a final step where the pixel values are run through a perceptual transformation to map them into 8 bit RGB (or more, if the hardware is is available.)This has issues. When you go from a dark space to a bright space, the eye's iris stops down. But not instantaneously. It takes a second or two. This can be simulated. Cyberpunk 2077 does this. Go from a dark place in the game to bright sunlight and, for a moment, the screen becomes blinding, then adjusts.In the other direction, go into a dark space, and it's dark at first, then seems to lighten up after a while. Dark adaptation is slower then light adaptation.Tone mapping is not just an intensity adjustment. It has to compensate for the color space intensity problems the OP mentions. Human eyes are not equally sensitive to the primary colors.Some visually impaired people hate this kind of adjustment, it turns out.Here's a clip from Cyberpunk 2077.[2] Watch what happens to screen brightness as the car goes into the tunnel and then emerges into daylight.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping[2] https://youtu.be/aWlX793ACUY?t=145&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See Oklab colorspace for an attempt at fairer perceptual brightness: https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734851</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Trust No Client" discusses the importance of implementing security measures in software architecture, emphasizing that developers should not blindly trust client data inputs. It highlights various strategies to mitigate risks, such as input validation, using secure coding practices, and remaining vigilant against manipulation or exploitation. The piece advocates for a proactive approach to security, stressing the need to treat all client information as potentially unsafe and to adopt rigorous testing and monitoring procedures to safeguard applications against vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm about 90% sure that for some inane reason, McDonalds outsources and creates separate apps for each country/region with these disastrous security flaws, except that at HQ they universally demand horrifically counter-productive "anti-root" measures for every locale, to a larger extent than even finance apps.Why am I so sure about this? I live on the other side of the world, the app is almost certainly an entirely separate codebase from the Polish one the article is about, and yet here too it has the worst anti-root measures of any app by any remotely large company, including finance, healthcare and government apps. Enormous numbers of false positives. Even for those with the most mainstream Android models around.This will all just come down to one person at McD's HQ who is forcing through these ridiculous ideas and costing their company a bunch of money in the process. No other multinational employs this strategy to any similar degree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an app tries to detect that I have root or a non-stock OS, I will give it a 1-star review on Google Play 100% of the time. Everyone who has a rooted device should do this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; [the extensive anti-reverse engineering measures are] more annoying than any financial app I've had, and I have 5 of them on my phoneAh, this reminds me of the Tuya app.I've done some ssl unpinning and mitm to see requests going in and out of my phone, it's pretty fun and there's often really nice and easy to use restful APIs underneath. Among them I've also done a couple of banking apps and they weren't particularly defensive either. That's great; as a user I'm empowered by it and like TFA says, it's totally fine from a security standpoint if you just don't trust the client to do anything they shouldn't be able to do. It shouldn't be your form validation that stops me from transferring a trillion dollars, and though I haven't tried, I'm sure that's not the case for those apps. All it does is allow me to get my monthly statements with a for loop rather than waiting for a laggy UI and clicking through each month.Now, Tuya is a Chinese company offering a bunch of cheap IoT devices like smart power switches and IR motion detectors. You can interact with everything through their app. That app for some reason has spent by far the most resources on anti-RE of any apps I've seen. I already bought your hardware, mate. Please let me use it on my local network. My smart home infrared motion sensors were meant to turn lights on when I enter a room. But they don't feel very smart when I'm standing in the dark for 4 seconds while they check with a server in China. I don't even need a clean API; just let me see what you do, and I'll do something similar, no support or documentation necessary. But they go through extensive measures to prevent you from interacting with the hardware you bought and which is sitting in your home.This was a while ago, but I think for the motion sensing in particular, I managed to just put them in a subnetwork with blocked internet access, and snooped on the network to catch their DHCP requests when they tried to call home. This would happen every once in a while presumably for settings/update checks, but crucially also when there was motion detected, and I didn't mind a few false positives. So in the end they were very quick, locally functioning, privacy-friendly little devices!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734956</guid></item><item><title>25.

I don't think so?Wordle - NYT daily word game. https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.htmlWaffle - some other game. https://wafflegame.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just found the following version of the Waffle game: 
https://wordle-nyt.org/waffleThe host name includes “nyt”, but the web page doesn’t seem to be owned by the New York Times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting! I think there is a lot of math going on in these kind of games. I have noticed interesting patterns in my game https://videopuzzle.org/ as well.In daily mode, everyone gets a video scrambled into 4x4 pieces, in the same way, and needs to unscramble it. The operations available to unscramble a video are swapping a tile, and shifting the entire board. The lowest score every day is usually 12-14, but sometimes much lower.Before I introduced the shifting function, surprisingly, every puzzle could only be solved in an either even or odd number of moves. Some days, all solutions would be 12-14-16 etc, while other days only 13-15-17 were possible. The arrows have changed this, as you can sometimes shave another move off if you use it smartly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742057</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ongoing debate over drug prices in the U.S., highlighting President Biden's efforts to implement policies aimed at reducing costs for Medicare recipients. It contrasts his administration's approach with that of former President Trump, who focused on transparency and negotiations without directly capping prices. The piece outlines the implications of proposed measures on pharmaceutical companies, the potential impact on patients, and the broader political landscape as drug pricing remains a contentious topic in American healthcare reform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My ACA insurance (because I was unemployed) covered Rybelsus (pill form, which is a much higher dose due to lack of absorption through the stomach), then in like October or November they said "nah" and said "go to Ozempic" I had just completed my first two sets of increases before the final uppage to be on the stable dose, when insurance said "Nah." So my doc RX'd Trulicity to see if they would cover that, which, for some reason they also didn't.  I haven't had the time or energy during the holidays to deal with it, so now I'm dealing with increased hunger from going cold turkey off these things all because of bullshit micromanagement from shitty insurance companies on the market place.If this makes it better and easier for companies to actually pay out for this I am 100% for it, there should not be a constant jerking about for what is or isn't paid.  Also - this wasn't for weightloss (which I assume would have been Wegovy approved), this was for diabetes, and it was under control with Rybelsus, and I assume Ozempic, though we were still in the process of building up to it (I was on max dose of Rybelsus and I'm pretty sure I needed the max Ozempic as well).  If they had given a reason for the denial it'd be one thing but it was just a blanket denial.I just hope this makes it easier for folks who need it to be able to obtain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very glad to see this, it's worth noting that the compounded semiglutide pricing  (think generic, although it's more complicated than that) has been plummeting ever since it was introduced onto the market. We've seen some pretty incredible results and I really hope they get cheap enough to be prescribed more widely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be easier to squeeze Novo if they included Zepbound from Eli Lilly in the mix - we could argue that if we're going to spend unfathomable amounts on these medications we might as well buy the more effective medication from an American company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737985</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great idea combining batman with libp2p! You guys have the heart in the right place :-).Currently, your project seems to be an opinionated wrapper ontop of libp2p. For this to become a proper distributed toolkit you lack an abstraction to for apps to collaborate over shared state (incl. convergence after partition). Come up with a good abstraction for that, and make it work p2p (e.g. delta state based CRDTs, or op-based CRDTs based on a replicated log; event sourcing ..). Tangentially related, a consensus abstraction might also be handy for some applications.Also check out [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) as a potential awesome replacement for p2p; as well as [Actyx](https://github.com/Actyx/Actyx) as an inspiration of similar (sadly failed) project using rust-libp2p.Oh, and you might want to give your docs a grammar review.Kudos for showing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;batman-advanced is a pretty interesting choice for a routing / handshake mechanism. Are your own applications mostly focussed on 802.11s Wi-Fi or where does the choice come from?In Profinet / Ethernet based networks it's more common to use ARP or mDNS for the discovery because multicast addresses are supported everywhere. Multicast DNS would be independent on top of the existing network layer and compatible with smartphones and other consumer devices (and even printers). That's why I'm asking, was there a specific reason to not use mDNS?Airprint, airscan, filedrop and other things are based on bonjour (mDNS-SD), and supported pretty well on consumer devices and routers. [1][1] http://dns-sd.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the architecture document here.[1]The usual problems with these things are discovery and security. Discovery is done via local WiFi broadcast. Not clear how security is done. How do you allow ad-hoc networking yet disallow hostile actors from connecting?[1] https://docs.p2p.industries/concepts/architecture/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42694384</guid></item><item><title>30.

    - Is the dealer obligated to disclose data collection?

I'll be in the market for a new car in the next few years but I do not want to buy anything that tracks or collects ANY data about me.I was assuming that buying a cheap non-electric car would offer some protection but I'd love to know more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the FTC. Why and how did they start protecting consumer privacy? Could they have done it before? Do they have an overall systematic plan for protecting it comprehensively? Do they have a guiding principle?I'm glad they are moving forward on it, at least until Monday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about monetary compensation? People lost real money, damages can be calculated.After all, if I installed spying software on GM's computers, and sold the extracted data to, say, Toyota, I'd face hefty fines.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm one of the creators of OpenHands (fka OpenDevin). I agree with most of what's been said here, wrt to software agents in general.We are not even close to the point where AI can "replace" a software engineer. Their code still needs to be reviewed and tested, at least as much as you'd scrutinize the code of a brand new engineer just out of boot camp. I've talked to companies who went all in on AI engineers, only to realize two months later that their codebase was rotting because no one was reviewing the changes.But once you develop some intuition for how to use them, software agents can be a _massive_ boost to productivity. ~20% of the commits to the OpenHands codebase are now authored or co-authored by OpenHands itself. I especially love asking it to do simple, tedious things like fixing merge conflicts or failing linters. It's great at getting an existing PR over the line.It's also important to keep in mind that these agents are literally improving on a _weekly_ basis. A few weeks ago we were at the top of the SWE-bench leaderboard; now there are half a dozen agents that have pulled ahead of us. And we're one launch away from leapfrogging back to the top. Exciting times!https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who uses AI coding tools daily and has done a fair amount of experimentation with different approaches (though not Devin), I feel like this tracks pretty well. The problem is that Devin and other "agentic" approaches take on more than they can handle. The best AI coders are positioned as tools for developers, rather than replacements for them.Github Copilot is "a better tab complete". Sure, it's a neat demo that it can produce a fast inverse square root, but the real utility is that it completes repetitive code. It's like having a dynamic snippet library always available that I never have to configure.Aider is the next step up the abstraction ladder. It can edit in more locations than just the current cursor position, so it can perform some more high-level edit operations. And although it also uses a smarter model than Copilot, it still isn't very "smart" at the end of the day, and will hallucinate functions and make pointless changes when you give it a problem to solve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one of the big problems with Devin (and AI agents in general) is that they're only ever as good as they are. Sometimes their intelligence feels magical and they accomplish things within minutes that even mid level or senior software engineers would take a few hours to do. Other times, they make simple mistakes and no matter how much help you give, they run around in circles.A big quality that I value in junior engineers is coachability. If an AI agent can't be coached (and it doesn't look like it right now), then there's no way I'll ever enjoy using one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734681</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-planned steps by Planner will go wrong more often than not, as it will try to guess the UI layers from its memory/training data. Its better to just ask the "next step" by giving it current state of the UI.I have built a similar project for mobile automation [1] and the validator phase is not separate rather it's inherently baked in each step since we only ask next step based on current UI and previous actions.My Planner sometimes goes "Oh, we are still on home screen, let's find the Uber app icon". This sort of self-correcting behaviour was not programmed but the LLM does it on its own.1. https://github.com/BandarLabs/ClickClickClick - A framework to automate mobile use via any LLM (local/remote)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many of the examples given for agents such as this are things I just flat wouldn’t  trust an LLM to do - buying something on Amazon for example: Will it pick new or ‘renewed’?  Will it select an item that is from a janky looking vendor and may be counterfeit? Will it pick the cheapest option for me?  What if multiple colors are offered?This one example alone has so many branches that would require knowing what’s in my head.On the flip side, it’s a ridiculously simple task for a human to do for themselves, so what am I truly saving?Call me when I can ask it to check the professional reviews of X category on N websites (plus YouTube), summarize them for me, and find the cheapest source for the top 2 options in the category that will arrive in Y days or sooner.That would be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UI is most common interface but not particularly AI friendly, i'll wait for more standardized interface that's both human and AI friendly.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. This is a bit of an unusual project, but I can break down the gist of it in two main pieces.The first is a new web-based, real-time nonlinear optics simulator for the situation of light propagating within a reflective cavity with an adaptive lens structure at the center. My understanding of the landscape of NLO simulators is there's not much real-time or for the web, so extracting that bit of code (within simulation.js) may be a decent starting point for other projects. That said, depending on what your goals for simulation the level of accuracy provided by a real-time simulation may not be sufficient. My understanding is that if you are doing detailed simulation to refine e.g. lens structures intended for production in the real world you likely need more detailed modeling than the slow varying envelope approximation (SVEA) that I use here.The other aspect of the project is a little difficult to describe but I was basically trying to create a minimal idealized model of a setup with nonlinear dynamics controlled by an optimization process as a kind of "pendulum" setup for whatever's the minimal essential magic behind the efficacy of e.g. transformer models. The exploration is not complete, but the idea was basically like: is there some switch where an alteration in technique in the optimization structure ends up being a step-function more effective in controlling the light fields than without. That's the general idea. More specifically what started the project though was being curious whether you could in some way use waves reflected from a boundary as an error signal for a backpropagation-like process. I found out in the course of my work here that this has been done in practice using phase-conjugate waves to encode the corrections. In order to create these phase-conjugate waves you'd need a "four-wave mixing" setup, which the simulation in its present state does not support but could be extended to.A note on process: this project was basically kicked off because I tried one-shotting a basic version of it with openai's o1 model and it worked a lot better than I was expecting, so much of the motivation here was also to see how much I could use sota LLMs to assist on a project like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is extremely cool! Curious on the story behind this /u/westoncb!It reminds me of Huygens Optics' recent videos about modelling particles as confined light using a particular non-linear medium [0], is it possible to create similar 'light' particles with tweaks to your setup?[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP5Pbx8I4s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does nonlinear optics also create harmonics as with nonlinear electronics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731417</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The website is a comprehensive guide to the Lua programming language, specifically presenting the "Programming in Lua" book, which serves as both an introduction and an in-depth resource. It covers essential topics such as Lua's syntax, data types, functions, and modules, as well as advanced concepts like coroutines and object-oriented programming. The guide is structured in chapters that provide explanations, examples, and practical applications, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers looking to enhance their skills with Lua.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me Lua, from a minimalism point of view, feels like the Go of dynamically typed languages.I love how you can acquire the language easily within a very short period of time (apart from some idioms, which like in other languages take more practice). I appreciate the low number of keywords and that you have only one real way to structure data, through tables. Yet, you can use meta tables to "emulate" classes as blueprints for object creation and even inheritance, if you really need OOP, or for that matter other paradigms. In a way this reminds me of JavaScript prototypes.As an indie game dev, Love2D really clicked. Lua is awesome as a scripting language inside a host language like C/C++/Rust, because it is simple, intuitive (both for imperative or functional styles) and rather fast.I'm even using it as my go-to scripting language for the Linux CLI instead of Python. Python, as great as it is, feels sometimes too comprehensive for small scripts. I like to script using a language I can fully keep in my "working memory", without having to refresh my memory about some constructs/idioms. That said, I use Rust as my main statically typed language, so maybe I'm just finding excuses for my love for Lua...I also think Lua is underrated as a possible first language. Its simplicity, readability and details like using keywords for blocks (do, end, etc) IMO make it suitable for beginners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work in Lua every day as a game developer. A GOTY in 2023 being my highest achievement so far. By and large Lua just gets out of the way, which is the most important thing for me.
 I have some minor issues with it, nothing huge, and I work around them with some utility functions that I've created or collected over the years.The most recent edition of this book is from 2016. Surely time for a new edition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This the latest edition I know about being online somewhere: https://archive.org/details/pil-4th (Programming In Lua - Fourth edition, for Lua 5.3, 2016)I'm not sure there is a fifth edition (for Lua 5.4) but the manual/reference + fourth edition seems good enough for at least my usage: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682777</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The domain (digital) might be less important than the role.As a contributor, you have to be an expert, but you're really not on the hook.As a decider, you can be a generalist, but you're on the hook.The traditional mid-life transition is from contributor to decider, into management or starting your own company.In my lifetime, the value of contributors has diminished while the value of deciders has exploded, largely due to the pace of change and the leverage of capital.  Contributor skills get stale fast, but deciders making the right decision at the right time is a gold mine, waiting to be tapped by capital leveraging the latest tech/policy.Also, I think people mature more as deciders.  It grows confidence and effectiveness.  Contributors grow to become defensive and stuck, i.e., dependent on being specifically useful.It's tempting to look for nearby opportunities, but it may be more transformative to ask what kind of person you want to be in 10 years (and what will the world be like).  If you operate from that perspective, you're leveraging world change and relatively immune to personal difficulty.  People respect that, and you can be proud of making your way instead of just fitting in.Becoming a principal rather than an agent is something (like meditation) that applies at all fractal scales of life, so you can re-orient while in current roles.And don't worry too much about realistic.  Focus more on delivering value, and the principle of least action will arrange things for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting jobs I've seen are where people bring two specializations together, into a single role.Take the strategy, user research and frameworks you do to drive better CX, and apply that to something you have a deep interest in away from the usual mainstream. It could be a hobby, it could be the cyber stuff you're interested in.On that, you're more likely to enjoy getting into cybersecurity by joining a company doing that today as a CX expert and getting more technical over time and looking for a horizontal move, than you are from starting from scratch and working on an IT help desk and trying to work your way up.I'd also suggest starting a blog or producing open source content in the field you want to move into. I'm starting to do this, because it can highlight my knowledge/skills while my CV is in a completely different field, in order to gently build traction and attention in my "target" industry.One last thought: don't underestimate that you're stressed, burned out and just need a decent period of slow work to recover. I think most people looking for major changes in their career are just tired and fed up. I know I am. They say a change is as good as a rest, but a rest is as good as a rest as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a 15 year JavaScript developer. Now I run operations for an enterprise API system at a large organization.My career stagnated as a JavaScript developer. Most of my peers were afraid to write original software which made it really challenging to do anything until I was finally laid off from worst of it. Everything had to be little more than copy/paste from some enormous framework into an enormous mono…monster of stupidity. If you ever proposed sanity people would get irate because it threatens to expose that nobody has idea what they are doing.Simultaneously, though, I have a part time job in the military. In the military I learned networking (routers and switches), operations, security, management, and more. I still maintain my security certs and have a clearance.Last year a recruiter reached out to me about a work from home job writing enterprise APIs. I passed the interview using my knowledge of data structures and the inner mechanics of WebSockets from years of writing personal software. For most of my career as a JavaScript developer it seemed the only way I could program at all was to do it on my own outside of work.Since then they promoted to lead operations and at the same time to be a team lead in a different organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42735767</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Derelict" delves into the story of a forgotten and abandoned ship, exploring its mysterious history and the maritime legends surrounding it. It recounts the discovery of this vessel, its once-glorious adventures, and how it eventually fell into decay, capturing the allure of shipwrecks and the stories they leave behind. The narrative reflects on themes of neglect, time, and the tales that emerge from objects left to the ravages of nature. Through vivid imagery and storytelling, the piece invites readers to ponder the fates of such forgotten relics of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a research paper on RealGPU, an efficient architecture for GPU-based computing that addresses the limitations of traditional NoCs (Network on Chips). It proposes a novel design that aims to improve data communication and resource utilization within multi-GPU systems, enhancing performance scalability and reducing energy consumption. The paper discusses the architectural innovations and experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of RealGPU in terms of throughput and latency compared to existing solutions. Additionally, it highlights the potential for RealGPU to advance applications in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth guide to mastering the Isolated Queen Pawn (IQP) in chess, detailing its characteristics, strategic advantages, and common tactics associated with this pawn structure. It explores the positioning of pieces, typical plans for both sides when an IQP is present, and tips for effectively managing the strengths and weaknesses that arise from this configuration. Through examples and illustrative games, the guide aims to enhance players' understanding of the complexities involved in games featuring an isolated queen pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This analysis is largely drawn from the book Winning Pawn Structures by Baburin (1998), which the blog author credits. Most chess books do not keep their relevance past 5 years, so it's a great testament to the quality of the book that it's still highly esteemed today.Baburin is a Russian-born Grandmaster who came to Ireland around 1993. You might think the popularity of this book would have led to a generation of Irish players who specialized in IQP positions. But instead the opposite seemed to happen: it bred a generation who assumed their opponents had read the book, felt they hadn't mastered it themselves, and avoided those positions with both Black and White.A contributing factor was that this book was more difficult for young intermediate players to grasp than an openings manual, where you can improve your results just by memorising a few extra lines. Perhaps also that there just wasn't the same culture of chess and chess education that other European countries had: Irish players just weren't used to being taught how to play the middlegame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chess is such an interesting game wish more poor children had access resources to learn it without sthe stressors of poverty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680796</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article "In Defence of Productivity Crap" argues that productivity tools and techniques, often dismissed as gimmicky or ineffective, can actually offer valuable insights and motivation for individuals looking to improve their efficiency. The author defends the use of various productivity hacks and frameworks, explaining that while they may not work universally, they can spark creativity and help individuals find their own methods of productivity. By embracing these tools without rigidly adhering to them, people can discover what truly enhances their workflow and personal effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an autistic individual, I find task management systems invaluable not for their own sake, but because they help me overcome my natural difficulty in switching between detailed and big-picture thinking. While I excel at focusing on details, I can struggle to identify true priorities. My simple system (voice memos processed through Claude) helps me intentionally zoom between granular tasks and high-level priorities. This isn't about getting lost in productivity tools - it's about having the right support structure for how my brain naturally works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you know what needs to be done, you don't need "productivity", you just need to work.When you don't know what needs to be done, no amount of "productivity" will compensate for the fact that any work you do is meaningless and any result thereof accidental.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading both posts it sounds like they're in violent agreement rather than disagreeing. There is a lot of FOMO in the aesthetics of productivity but at the end of the day everyone needs a system. It's wise to balance trying to improve the system with getting work done.Personally I run with a very minimalist setup, am unlikely to change software defaults unless I need too, keep a todo list for myself and use whatever we're using this week to work with others.I do wonder how much the more productivity systems optimizing people are measuring the actual result versus chasing aesthetics but at the same time I've not noticed it being a net drain so don't particularly care. In part I think it's a case of doing what works for you unless it becomes detrimental. There's a lot to be said for ritual making you comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42681969</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of cascading Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and critiques the traditional implementation of this framework within organizations. It argues that while OKRs can enhance alignment and focus, the conventional top-down approach often leads to rigidity and a lack of engagement among teams. The author proposes a more flexible and collaborative method for setting OKRs, encouraging feedback and adaptability to better achieve results and foster a culture of ownership across all levels of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

At that reading -- I forget the exact context -- but either Kevin, or possibly another poet deadpanned the word "straight" in a poem, which got a few MFA students in a tussy, which was kinda funny. (For context, Killian has won awards for his gay erotic fiction.)Super nice guy. Wished me happy birthday on Facebook every year, even though we'd only talked maybe two or three times. I was very sad to hear of his passing a few years back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got the opportunity to get to know Kevin in the mid 1990's.  He was visiting Vancouver and created a play for some local artists and writers to perform in, me being one of them.   He was a generous, brilliant man and sorely missed.

They are free apps, running on a shoestring budget.But that whole account looks a little dodgy. The posts make it seem like one of those "I made $30K/mo, from my living room! You can too!" outfits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run your cloud contracts (or anything possible to incur liability) through a separate LLC so if there are billing issues you can just move on.The structure should look like:"My App LLC" has contract with "My Host LLC" for hosting services. "My Host LLC" provides those services via a cloud provider. If "My Host LLC" racks up a 2 million dollar bill with the cloud provider and goes out of business then I just move to "New Host LLC" and carry on.It's not as if the patients of a Doctor who fails to pay his office rent would become liable.This is the entire purpose of LLCs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the days before, there used to be a hard spending limit - I know this because of an old official tutorial video on youtube. Last time I checked, there was billing alert functionality and they were recommending creating a function that will halt your service when it hits the limit - the problem is, billing lags behind and you can rack up a hefty sum until anything is triggered.Amazing service but its a scary one. Every time a social-media-worthy accident happens, they cancel the bill but I wonder how many are burned without recourse.Maybe if your rack up something modest like 5K accidentally, its better to push it as high as you can and get it declined  on your CC and increase your social media prospects :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732714</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having made an 4 year excursion from IT into the world of making gears, I can attest that what seems like something fairly simple from the outside really isn't.Just like a bearing, gears (ideally) have a rolling contact. The smoother and harder the faces the better, until you get to the point where fractures and spalling occur. The best gears are cut, sent out to be hardened via heat treat, then ground (with "superfinishing") to exact size. As with bearings, you have to get the size just right for long life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of SKF's sponsorship of the new Marble Machine by Martin from WintergatanSee for example this video, how to choose your ball bearinghttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-BgMiC2yg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting away Mosquitos (the real Wunderwaffe of that war) for freight runs (and for stuffing the occasional Nobel Price physicist in the bomb bay) tells a rather different story about the importance of swedish-made ball bearings for UK arms production:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37884749&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42743673</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of software on the fast food industry, highlighting how technology enhances efficiency and customer experience. It details various software solutions that streamline operations, such as digital ordering systems, inventory management, and employee scheduling tools. Additionally, the piece emphasizes the importance of these technologies in adapting to changing consumer preferences and improving profitability. Overall, it underscores the transformation of fast food operations through software innovation, contributing to better service and operational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like someone who hasn't been in the industry long enough to know what it is like to try and design software before implementing it with groups larger than 3, and yearns for problems that aren't as complex as the ones they are dealing with.It is easy to build "home cooked" (by his definition) software when you are building for a small number of people by a small number of people. Old Visual Basic programs built for a single version of Linux will do just fine - and that will work well for some use cases. But if you are building software that has to work on thousands to millions of machines, and fulfill their needs, you will need to build a factory to build that software.The factory, in this case, is the infrastructure necessary to turn the R&amp;D (you and me) into the repeatable product (that is, your app.) The factories need a lot of maintenance. If nobody is buying your product, you need to change the factory to produce outputs that people are buying. If people have bought your product (let's say... on subscription) then you need to keep the factory maintained well enough to produce the product that people are happy to buy.Some things will be like tarsnap and change relatively little. That's great. A small shop will need less maintenance. A bigger shop that is a factory for more users with wider needs will need more complicated products and that will mean more maintenance.But yes, if you don't need to have a return on investment, you don't need to react to customers' needs and therefore you can build a spec first and let it change little. (Or, you build something as niche and as good as Tarsnap!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I couldn't disagree with the premise of the sections more on development methodology&gt; Fast Food
&gt; Here, we develop in "agile" sprints. Working software is developed at the fastest pace possible, and all bugs are to be fixed later.&gt; Home Cooked
&gt; Here, things are slower, more thoughtful. More waterfall-y.While Sprints is a term that sounds like fastest pace possible, that is not what the term means; and a key part about waterfall vs agile is that waterfall IS NOT more thoughtful, but all planned up front.Both methodologies can create bugs, or deliver features faster than scale can be thought of and deliver features faster than can be tested.If we remove the quotes from "agile" we actually get slower and thoughtful. A key part of that is measuring (training, interviewing, analyzing). An agile process should build a feature, release that feature, interview users, analyze system behavior, iterate by improving user's goal, adding appropriate scale, iterating by removing unexpected errors or behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the same vein, I recommend reading this post by Robin Sloan

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Geerling's article discusses the creation of a compact and portable homelab called the "Project Mini Rack." The project focuses on building a small-scale server rack that can house various hardware components essential for a homelab setup, offering insights into design considerations, equipment choices, and practical implementation. Geerling shares his experiences and challenges faced during the process, providing valuable tips for readers looking to set up their own efficient and space-saving homelabs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that he linked an inexpensive "260W GaN USB-C Charging Station".It's less than $30 with a coupon, which seems to good to be true.A look at the Amazon 2-star reviews suggests it has good build quality but can only output 75W to 100W total, not 260W as advertised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I don't understand about these Pi based mini-racks is why you would build a home lab that's less powerful than your client devices. My 24 U rack exists precisely because I want on demand, large amounts of compute/GPU for compiling, transcoding, encrypting, etc. and the cloud is too expensive. If you're going to make the investment into any type of home labbing, why gimp yourself with devices that can only run small services you could run on a single old desktop using containers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have zero need for a portable raspberry pi cluster but damn is this cool anyway.Also, I learned about this device from this post and immediately bought one for my existing home server remote access: https://jetkvm.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738284</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines what users can expect from the upcoming release month of the Zig programming language. It highlights key features and improvements, such as enhancements in the compiler, standard library updates, and significant bug fixes. Additionally, it discusses community involvement, upcoming events, and the importance of feedback from users to shape the language's development. Overall, it emphasizes the excitement around the new features and the commitment to making Zig more efficient and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

The memory safety guardrails are just high enough to help out without feeling like a tourist trap.There is space to enjoy writing code with someone’s PhD dissertation, untyped dynamic free for alls, and all that in between. Zig feels like a hacker's language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been a lurking fan of Zig for a while. Discovering they listen to IM and Bliss to code to just made me like their project even more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding Aro (new C compiler in the Zig toochain), it seems that a C compiler written in Zig shortens considerably the path to supporting constexpr in C using Zig's comptime capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737345</guid></item><item><title>48.

If you haven't seen the inside of LexusNexus, it is a stalkers paradise. I got a glimpse when I talked to some guys about helping them with some python automation. Turned out they use LexusNexus to figure out who to buy mineral rights from for fracking nat gas. They gloated how they used deep personal data to do thing like play spouses against each other as they are going through a divorce. I walked away because of basic human values and ethics I feel need to be upheld&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am having trouble making sense the word "parks" in the title. Is "GM parks" an entity, or is this a mistake and "parks" is just an extra verb in there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So basically if I get out of the store not paying I'm going to jail, but big companies when doing crime, they promise they will behave for five years, and then go on, but more openly?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re looking for a compressor.Lots of pro audio boxes out there.A MiniDSP box where you can implement a compressor is fun, you can also tune just about everything else with it.https://docs.minidsp.com/product-manuals/flex/dsp-reference/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 - Get an amplifier that has a "Night Mode" function. It has been a basic function on most AV-receivers in the past decade+, assuming you don't buy the most pedestrian model. It compresses the dynamic range of the sound, to avoid the loud parts waking up the neighbors while you can also hear the conversations. Of course here you are looking for an investment of between $350 and $inf. Buying secondhand can save big bucks.2 - Use a PC for your video needs. Most video players support the same function (VLC, GOM player, Kodi... look for "dynamic range compression" and similar options). A 10 years old mid-tier machine will play everything including UHD, so this solution is fairly cheap. If you get a cheap IR-USB remote, you won't even have to mess with keyboard and mouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your source is Dolby Digital, you may not need anything new - just adjusting your settings. Dynamic range compression is a standard feature, and the bitstream should already include the necessary metadata for the decoder to implement this.It's been a while since I looked into this in detail, but iirc the decoder must automatically enable dynamic range compression when it's set to two channel output. So avoid configurations where you first convert the audio to 5.1 channel PCM or analog, and then apply downmixing or virtual surround.If you're using a surround system, most receivers have a night mode as mentioned by others already. Some have also an adaptive system that adjusts the dynamic range based on your volume setting - turn it up and you get the full dynamic range, turn it down and the dynamic range is compressed more as you set the volume lower to try to keep the dialog audible. Many receivers include a microphone for automatic settings, and after calibration know the actual output level. The Dolby Digital bitstream (and I think DTS) include a flag to indicate the overall dialog level, and based on these a receiver can do quite a good job. Some I think go only by the DD metadata, others have a compressor that can be applied to any input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42702507</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting to quit working is a different feeling. You may spend time in the first month untangling your role and your ego. I had no idea how important the status was to me until I was just a guy, at home, that no one needed. It was a valuable lesson about self worth, and one that stayed around after I rejoined the work force.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit his job to start a company. Probably different from quitting with the intent to look for another job, or take a break, or retire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quit a hell of a job (in the good sense!) kinda out of nowhere at a point in my career where I was in a great upward trajectory to go on an "indefinite sabbatical" (turned out to be 7 months).I did not quit to start a company, but the sense of multiple plunges does resonate.From my perspective:- It's very hard to detach yourself from stable (and growing) personal finances- The comparison aspect is always there, you just need to learn to manage it- The most rewarding bit was re-adjusting my metric of what's sufficient/enough in life- I was not familiar with that video, but, indeed, I did learn to ask myself "would you rather be doing something else?" and the answer was no- I learned to dream again- As soon as I pulled the trigger on the decision I was flooded by a sense of insecurity even if I was really certain of itI wrote stuff about it at the time but never published it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42688834</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the National Archives' initiative to recruit volunteers to help transcribe and decipher cursive handwriting from historic documents. It highlights the challenges posed by cursive writing, particularly for younger generations who may not be familiar with it. The project aims to make these documents more accessible and to preserve historical records for future research and education. The National Archives encourages individuals to participate by providing guidance on how to get involved and contribute to this important work of transcription and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a really interesting project. But boy do they make it hard to participate.* Article doesn't provide a direct link to the topic mission* Signup is pretty easy. Well organized and even gently requires you to have two forms of 2FA.* Sign up complete. Go back to the primary page and try to find the mission. A little buried but not too deep.* Notice I'm not signed in. Ok, let's do that. Now I'm back on the main page and navigate back. Find the first document and open it. Really interesting to scan through the doc and to read. People back then generally had really nice handwriting.* Ok, what next, how do I transcribe? ... ? Oh it says I'm not logged in again. Fine, click the link and...* I'm logged in and directed back to the main page, again.Look, this is an interesting project and I'd love to spend my spare cycles to help out. But they really need to clean up this process.Volunteers shouldn't have to jump through kinda poorly designed interfaces to help out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before commenting asking about why they don't just use LLMs, please note that the article specifically calls out that they do, but it's not always a viable solution:&gt; The agency uses artificial intelligence and a technology known as optical character recognition to extract text from historical documents. But these methods don’t always work, and they aren’t always accurate.The document at the top is likely an especially easy document to read precisely because it's meant to be the hook to get people to sign up and get started. It isn't going to be representative of the full breadth of documents that the National Archives want people to go through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok I did one letter, from a woman in 1814 writing to James Monroe (then Secretary of State) asking for a passport to go to Scotland to get her late brother's property. What a trip! So enjoyable to get into the flow once you've "synchronized" with the persons handwriting. Furthermore, due to the fact that you're reading and re-writing word for word of whatever you're transcribing, the stories you end up reading have tremendous memory-stick. This is not surprising, considering that you are dedicating an inordinate amount of time per page, but it's a welcome side effect when you try and recollect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745334</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks neat. I have to look up the very fiddly and unintuitive systemd commands all the time. service start? service.foo start? start foo.service? Oh right, sudo systemctl start service.fooAnd the feedback is so bad. It should know everything in its own config dir and tell me how to do what I want to do. Was it enabled? I forget. How do I look at logs? Oh right journalctl. Also the layout of things with lots of symlinks and weird directories in places that annoy my 90's linux sysadmin brain. Why am I looking at /lib/systemd/systemI am annoyed by the redundant "systemd/system" directory name every time I have to go there. At this point, just promote it to /etc/systemd and build a better CLI.As a very occasional linux sysadmin just trying to make things work, the "typing at a console" systemd interfaces are not fun to work with. Maybe nobody should be doing that. In an enterprise, sure that's different. I think interfaces should be human, and linux should still be fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice.One thing I found systemd really confusing was its treatment of ExecStop in a service script.  ExecStart is the command to run when systemd starts the service at system boot up (or when a user tells systemd to start the service).  However, ExecStop is run when the starting command has finished running.  You have to set RemainAfterExit=yes to have the desired function of running the stop command on system shutdown or on user stopping the service.  ExecStop is basically the "on-cleanup" event rather than "to-shutdown-the-service" event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this. I use raw CLI commands until it hurts, and have recently embraced tools like lazygit/lazydocker to get visibility into otherwise opaque system/tree states, and it’s been a huge level-up.I have several user and system level services I manage, but debugging them is tedious. Your opening line that lists common commands and their pain points really resonated with me.I’m on NixOS, so editing immutable unit files directly won’t work, but the service discovery, visibility, and management will be really helpful. Nice work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42749402</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth exploration of the AMD Radeon Instinct MI300A, a high-performance accelerator designed for data centers and AI computations. It highlights the card's architecture, which integrates both CPU and GPU components on a single chip, enhancing speed and efficiency for machine learning and other intensive workloads. The piece discusses its features, including advanced memory options and performance specifications, while comparing it to competitors in the market. Additionally, it emphasizes the implications of the MI300A for cloud computing and the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often thought that one of the places AMD could distinguish itself from NVIDIA is bringing significantly higher amounts of VRAM (or memory systems that are as performant as what we currently know as VRAM) to the consumer space.A card with a fraction of the FLOPS of cutting-edge graphics cards (and ideally proportionally less power consumption), but with 64-128GB VRAM-equivalent, would be a gamechanger for letting people experiment with large multi-modal models, and seriously incentivize researchers to build the next generation of tensor abstraction libraries for both CUDA and ROCm/HIP. And for gaming, you could break new grounds on high-resolution textures. AMD would be back in the game.Of course, if it's not real VRAM, it needs to be at least somewhat close on the latency and bandwidth front, so let's pop on over and see what's happening in this article...&gt; An Infinity Cache hit has a load-to-use latency of over 140 ns. Even DRAM on the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D shows less latency. Missing Infinity Cache of course drives latency up even higher, to a staggering 227 ns. HBM stands for High Bandwidth Memory, not low latency memory, and it shows.Welp. Guess my wish isn't coming true today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the 300A is an accelerator coupled with a full 24-core EPYC and 128GB of HBM all on a single chip (or, packaged chiplets, whatever).Why is it I can't buy a single one of these, on a motherboard, in a workstation format case, to use as an insane workstation?  Assuming you could program for the accelerator part, there is an entire world of x86-fixed CAD, engineering, and entertainment industry (rendering, etc) where people want a single, desktop machine with 128GB + of fast ram to number crunch.There are Blender artists out there that build dual and quad RTX4090 machines with Threadrippers for $20k+ in components all day, because their render jobs pay for it.There are engineering companies that would not bat an eye at dropping $30k on a workstation if it mean they could spin around 80 gigabyte CATIA models of cars or aircraft loaded in RAM quicker. I know this at least because I sure as hell did with with several HP Z-series machines costing whole-Toyota-Corolla prices over the years...But these combined APU chips are relegated to these server units.  In the end is this a driver problem?  Just a software problem?  A chicken and egg problem where no one is developing the support because there isn't the hardware on the market, and there isn't the hardware on the market because AMD thinks there is no use case?Edit: and note my use cases mentioned don't rely on latency, really, like videogamers need to hit framerates.  The cache miss latency mentioned in the article doesn't matter as much for these type of compute applications where the main problems are just loading and unloading the massive amount of data.  Things like offline renders and post-processing CFD simulations.  Not necessarily a video output framerate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;its interesting that two simultaneous and contradictory views are held by AI engineers:- Software is over- An impenetrable software moat protects Nvidia's market capitalization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747864</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Infinite Wave Function Collapse (Infinite WFC) algorithm, an extension of the traditional Wave Function Collapse (WFC) model used for procedural content generation. It explores how the Infinite WFC allows for the generation of large, unbounded content by tiling and seamlessly extending patterns, making it suitable for applications in game development and other areas where endless environments are needed. The article provides insights into the algorithm's workings, implementation details, and potential use cases, along with examples to illustrate its effectiveness in creating complex and visually appealing structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700483"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work with this algorithm quite a bit in a personal project. (I've changed from calling it WFC to Model Synthesis; Paul Merrell earned the naming rights, unless we discover an even earlier description.)I mentally divide it into two important components:1. Cross-correlation  (the 'wave function')2. Label selection (choosing where the 'collapse' occurs)The "cross-correlation" is exactly what it sounds like - given an incomplete model and a set of example patterns, this data structure represents the cross-correlation of every place that any of the patterns would individually fit in the incomplete model.  I think this is the most useful structure in the algorithm, and is a form of iterative 'feature detection' over the incomplete model.I think there are many interesting things which can be done with this which aren't in the basic algorithm, such as:- Having larger indivisible 'patterns' and collapsing such patterns all at once.  Although example patterns are always broken down into discrete cells, larger patterns can exist where each cell gets a unique label and very limited transition set. The cross-correlation will detect where they can be placed, and if one is chosen the entire pattern could be chosen at once.- Partial seeding of labels, e.g. selecting portions of the incomplete model and artificially limiting the available labels in that area, without collapsing it.- Addition of information to labels which aren't easily expressed in an example pattern, such as rudimentary counting of distances.The 'label selection' portion (in WFC terms, this is the algorithm used to choose which space to 'collapse') is where all of the random generation comes into play.  If using Model Synthesis for full world generation, this is what should be focused on for generating more interesting types of environments.However, given the common label selection algorithms I've seen and used, I think that Model Synthesis excels mostly at adding small-scale, largely self-similar patterns onto constraints provided by a larger structure.  I think that other proc-gen methods better lend themselves to generating large-scale structures. A combination of the two - generating a large-scale structure to serve as a constraint, and allowing model synthesis to fill in interesting detail - seems like a good path to explore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think proc gen like this often falls victim to the 1000 bowls of oatmeal problem.Unless things _feel_ different, it just feels same-y.Some games handle this well (often through biomes with different rules and/or special areas with different rules) and others (interestingly, often those that talk about how many billions of possibilities there are) are techniquely different... But just all feel the same.It's interesting to see how game devs continue to be creative in this area and how many games continue to have this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People seem to go ga-ga over this algorithm with some frequency on HN, and I think it is only because of its in-name-only connection to quantum mechanics, because I have to say that as procedural generation algorithm I find it very lacking. It works on the cases I saw for something like a 10x10 grid decently enough but for any large-scale work it just produces endless seas of structureless repetition. Even the long-in-the-tooth "just fire Perlin noise at varying levels of detail at the problem" at least produces some overarching structure even if it is itself just random because the low-frequency, high-amplitude components you use will produce some sort of higher-level variation.Literally anything with any hierarchy in it would be better, unless you're really leaning into that SCP-esque, liminal-space creepiness. But if that isn't your explicit goal I would definitely not recommend this for large-scale usage because in most projects that creepy liminal-space-ness is probably actively fighting your artistic goals.It wouldn't even take that much; lay down some sort of street network with some other algorithm, a bit of "zoning" to switch some tile sets between "residential" and some other zone or even just a couple different types of "residental", perlin noise it up if you've got no better ideas, then use "wave function collapse" (I really dislike the in-name-only "quantumness" of the name, can hardly call the algorithm that with a straight face) to fill in the blocks. A straightforward implementation of that would still be pretty same-y but it would at least have some sort of structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42700483</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of an Amazon web crawler designed to extract product data from Amazon's website. It highlights the challenges faced, such as navigating Amazon's complex site structures and handling anti-bot measures. The author shares insights into the technologies and methodologies employed in building the crawler, including the use of specific programming languages and libraries. The crawler's capabilities, potential use cases, and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping are also addressed, emphasizing the importance of adhering to legal guidelines and respecting website terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's time for a lawyer letter. See the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prosecution guidelines.[1] In general, the US Justice Department will not consider any access to open servers that's not clearly an attack to be "unauthorized access". But,"However, when authorizers later expressly revoke authorization—for example, through unambiguous written cease and desist communications that defendants receive and understand—the Department will consider defendants from that point onward not to be authorized."So, you get a lawyer to write an "unambiguous cease and desist" letter. You have it delivered to Amazon by either registered mail or a process server, as recommended by the lawyer. Probably both, plus email.Then you wait and see if Amazon stops.If they don't stop, you can file a criminal complaint. That will get Amazon's attention.[1] https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the solution in this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42727510.Put a link somewhere in your site that no human would visit, disallow it in robots.txt (under a wildcard because apparently OpenAI’s crawler specifically ignores wildcards), and when an IP address visits the link ban it for 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upvoted because we’re seeing the same behavior from all AI and Seo bots. They’re BARELY respecting Robots.txt, and hard to block. And when they crawl, they spam and drive up load so high they crash many servers for our clients.If AI crawlers want access they can either behave, or pay. The consequence will almost universal blocks otherwise!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750420</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study highlighted on NutraIngredients Asia reveals that an increased intake of potassium during dinner is associated with fewer sleep disturbances. The research suggests that consuming potassium-rich foods in the evening may enhance sleep quality by reducing issues such as waking up during the night. The article discusses the implications of these findings for dietary recommendations and emphasizes the importance of potassium for overall health, particularly in relation to sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't read too much into the title, the closing parts of the article give a much more balanced take on the whole issue. This study disagrees with some previous work and it's unclear which result makes sense and why. As usual, more research is needed, and while a catchy title is nice, this isn't anything to change your dietary habits by,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What isn't mentioned is that bananas and other potassium-rich foods are alkaline, and so can neutralize stomach acid reflux. Acid reflux is a common source of poor sleep quality. So that could be one explanation for the fewer sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this isn't related to potassium directly, but anecdotally I have had success using magnesium supplements for insomnia/improving general sleep quality. I have also been consuming electrolyte mixes containing potassium to help with muscle recovery from training, and have found them to help with physical soreness &amp; general well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742161</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the importance of bees and their role in ecosystem health. It highlights the various species of bees, their behaviors, and the critical services they provide, such as pollination, which is vital for the production of food and maintenance of biodiversity. The site also addresses the threats that bees face, including habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change, and encourages conservation efforts and practices to protect these essential pollinators. Additionally, it offers resources for individuals and communities to engage in bee-friendly initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honeybee queens are the only honeybees with stingers that don't die when they sting.  That's because the queen bee's stinger has no barbs, and the reason for that is that the queen must not die easily, and she must use her stinger, so if she's going to survive at all her stinger has to not have barbs.  The queen almost certainly has to use her stinger when she exits her cocoon: to kill ther other queens that are about to hatch or have hatched already.  She also has to possibly use her stinger when she goes out to mate (though she does go with attendants who will defend her if attacked).I was surprised not to find mention of this in TFA.&gt; A honey bee dies when it stings you because its stinger is covered in barbs, causing its abdomen to get ripped out when it tries to fly away. And surviving with your guts spilling out everywhere is pretty bloody hard.There's another interesting detail here: when the worker tries to fly off after stinging, she has to try really hard because the barbs hold the stinger in place, and trying hard causes two things to happen:  - noise that attracts other workers
    to attack the same creature
  
  - spreading of the dying bee's
    distress pheromones that also
    attract other workers to sting
    the same creature

So when you get stung by a bee near other bees you will be in trouble.  That's how you go from one sting to hundreds.  And hundreds is enough to kill a human.  That's why you don't go near a hive without protection.  Being in or near a swarm is safer than being near a hive: the bees in a swarm don't have much (larvae, honey) to protect, so they don't attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn’t that just so unbearably sad? These little creatures work tirelessly their whole lives, buzzing from flower to flower, pollinating the plants that sustain ecosystems and our food supply. They barely get to live a few weeks as worker bees, and then if they ever need to sting to protect their hive... that’s it. Their life ends in an act of ultimate devotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While a bee stinger may get stuck in you, that's not so when stinging fellow insects.The barbs don't catch on an exoskeleton like they do for thick and elastic mammalian skin.An elegant way to deliver more venom to larger targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42749069</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article highlights the playful and imaginative drawings created by Charles Darwin's children on the margins of his manuscripts. These illustrations, discovered in Darwin's notebooks, provide a glimpse into the family life and creativity of his children, showcasing their playful engagement with their father's scientific work. The piece celebrates the intersection of science and art, revealing how the children's sketches add a personal touch to Darwin's rigorous research, and invites readers to appreciate the lighter side of one of history's most significant scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t really care whose they are. I just love seeing any of these drawings.I have to imagine that drawing was a much greater source of entertainment at the time, and I’m kind of sad that that isn’t the case any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The project’s direc­tor, David Kohn, “doesn’t know for cer­tain which kids were the artists,” notes Staynor, “but he guess­es that at least three were involved: Fran­cis, who became a botanist; George, who became an astronomer and math­e­mati­cian; and Horace, who became an engi­neer.”Are we sure these were all from the children and none were the work of their father? Why couldn't Charley have thrown in a silly doodle himself?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not really exposed to children’s drawings, but these look particularly talented.I always feel a little weird about generating AI art because it really is   standing on the shoulders of giants. I’d say it’s the closest thing to when Napster got everyone used to theft.Any little simple drawing you generate is really off the back of kids and teenagers that draw out of a passion. So I try not to do it, feels icky.Ideally we want a world where we license the artist’s style, and hopefully they can get paid out like streaming music artists in the long term. Along with that, we need laws that let you sue people that copy the style with no license.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711012</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;hey! this is the inventor, danielle fong.thanks to curl-up who posted this, whoever you are.since it came up, "wire-to-wire" efficiency is what I intended to coin a synonym for electrical to electrical efficiency, with hydrogen storage. for example, an 80% electrical to hydrogen efficiency, and a 50% hydrogen to electrical efficiency, would yield a 40% wire to wire (electrical to electrical) efficiency. of course, people are working on 95% electric to hydrogen efficiency, and 50% fuel to electrical efficiency is a target.here's an illustrative energy flow diagram for us trying to hit 60% -- even more  aggressive.  https://x.com/DanielleFong/status/1775595848887677138&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The energy densities listed are flagged as approximate, so grains of salt etc, but the numbers on the page aren't entirely consistent.The stated energy density is "&gt; 500 watthours/liter".But higher on the page we see a relative-energy-density bar graph shows lightcell at 5x the energy density of lithium batteries, and (38/5 =) 7.6x less dense then petrol.  This implies an energy density for lightcell of 1250 Wh/liter, as (according to Google) petrol clocks in just under 9500 Wh/liter, and (again according to Google) lithium batteries can reach 300 Wh/liter so let's call it 250 for the math to work out.I'm curious which number is closer to truth: 500Wh/liter, or 1250?  Is 1250 the theoretical max and 500 the current output in a test rig?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bottom line: 40% efficiency, which is better than I expected but the competition is batteries at 80+% efficiency.  It's a hard sell, especially as continual improvements in battery storage will continue to eat away at their niche.5,000 W/kg sounds great on paper compared to 150 W/kg for batteries and is even in the same ballpark as gasoline at 12,000 W/kg, but I think that's just the figure for the fuel.  I don't think it includes storage, the solar panels, the burner, etc...  The cost is an open ended question as well.  Maybe this will pan out for aircraft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697001</guid></item><item><title>11.

For example, it described the motto "urbi et orbi" as "urb-eye e.t. orbee".Movement is very jerky (maybe because of my old computer?) and I was disappointed that I could only roam freely around the wireframe model, not any of the photographic images. Because of the jerkiness, it was sometimes hard to tell what part of the architecture I was looking at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The necropolis of Roman tombs, over which the Basilica was built, and what is claimed to be Peter's Tomb, can actually be visited, deep in the bowels of the Basilica.  To do so one must sign up for the Scavi Tour and book well in advance as only very small groups are taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I visited St. Peter's Basilica a few years ago. I highly recommend it.I had to exit the experience because my laptop (admittedly a few years old) could only give me 1-2 frames per second. I love the idea, but in the current state, viewing hi-res pictures would give you a better experience than this virtual 3d tour, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731740</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always telling this whenever the topic of Kalman Filters come up:If you're learning the Kalman Filter in isolation, you're kind of learning it backwards and missing out on huge "aha" moments that the surrounding theory can unlock.To truly understand the Kalman Filter, you need to study Least Squares (aka linear regression), then recursive Least Squares, then the Information Filter (which is a different formulation of the KF).
Then you'll realize the KF is just recursive Least Squares reformulated in a way to prioritize efficiency in the update step.This PDF gives a concise overview:[1] http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws13/mapping/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time that one comes up, this one comes up https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Pyt...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and advocates for its support across various platforms. The author expresses concerns about the decline of RSS use due to the rise of social media and other content delivery methods, highlighting the advantages of RSS, such as user control over content consumption and the ability to follow multiple sources in one place.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a general PSA, youtube channels have an RSS feed to alert you when a favourite creator releases a new video.The form ishttps://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2wdo5v...where channel_id is the channel hash code which is buried in the source for the "nicely named" channel:https://www.youtube.com/@CuttingEdgeEngineeringand can be found without source diving via (say) FeedBro (RSS browser extension) "Find Feeds in Current Tab" function.https://nodetics.com/feedbro/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of advocating RSS, I was trying out Nikola [0] for static site generation and found that they have a really nice-looking RSS end-point [1] that is viewable both from the browser and an RSS reader. Looking into the XML, it turns out it's called xml-stylesheet:    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="assets/xml/rss.xsl" media="all"?&gt;

And I would argue that this is an excellent way to introduce new readers to RSS: instead of the browser popping up a download prompt, you can make your RSS feeds themselves a dedicated page for advocating RSS, in case an interested reader is browsing through the links on your site.[0] https://getnikola.com/[1] https://getnikola.com/rss.xml (Open it in your browser!)[2] https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/blob/master/nikola/data/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently added RSS to my personal site (https://www.tyleo.com/)Even with a custom implementation it’s a simple thing to support. You can find the whole spec here: https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specificationI’ll mention that there is a competing Atom specification which is compatible with all notable RSS readers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard). The POV I’ve seen on HN favors Atom because it offers more functionality and is a clearer standard.I want to voice my support for RSS though based on its simplicity. To me the feed doesn’t need a bunch of bells and whistles. I get analysis paralysis I get deciding which Atom features to support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42746222</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recursive division algorithm used for generating mazes. It outlines the process by starting with a simple area and recursively dividing it into smaller sections by creating walls, ensuring that passageways are maintained between the divisions. The author explains the steps of the algorithm in detail, including how to determine where to place walls and how to create openings for paths. The narrative emphasizes how this method can create interesting and complex maze structures through systematic division. Additionally, visual examples illustrate the algorithm's results, making it clear how the technique produces varied maze configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite maze algorithm is this one: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/papers-fcpcg/presentation/sli...Live demo at: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/hydrodendron/It allows generating an infinite maze looking at any arbitrary area of the maze, without any loops, using fractal coordinates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remarkably simple with great results. I recommend checking out the author’s book Mazes for Programmers: one of the best programming books I’ve ever read. Incredibly clearly explained, and very interesting, which is an excellent combination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me a little of Hilbert curves.It would be kind of cool to generate an 'infinite' maze this way by starting the process and only recursing to max depth only for the nodes closest to the exits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42703816</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) released a statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold a ban on TikTok, expressing concern over the implications for free speech and digital privacy. The EFF argues that the ban sets a precedent that could endanger other social media platforms and restrict the rights of users to access content and communicate freely. They emphasize the need for transparency and accountability in governmental actions that impact technology and communication tools, calling for a critical examination of the motivations behind such bans.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the end, it's a security and sovereignty issue.  A country can restrict foreign business, full stop.That said, I don't think banning tiktok will have the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Shutting down communications platforms or forcing their reorganization based on concerns of foreign propaganda and anti-national manipulation is an eminently anti-democratic tactic, one that the US has previously condemned globally.These platforms are fundamentally anti-democratic in their very nature, increasingly so in the age of LLMs. They're places where people buy a voice and the illusion of support by astroturfing the platform and/or manipulating the algorithm (either through paid advertisements or by owning a platform and controlling the algorithm outright). They're places where a small minority of people can become an unstoppable movement that seems to have real support, sucking gullible voters in to join the growing "consensus".In short, these platforms are places for manufacturing consent. The only sense in which banning one is anti-democratic is that it's selectively applied to tiktok instead of to all such platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A former sausage maker here.  I (used to) design these engagement/recommendation engines for a large corp, did academic research in the field, went to conferences, etc.In general, I wholehearted support the freedom of speech, and if it were any other case, I would agree with the EFF statement here.  However, knowing how the sausages are made, I am reluctantly agreeing with the ban, at least for now.People underestimate how powerful these tools can be.  Based on simple, readily available "anonymous" data, we can already impute your demographics data -- age, gender, family relations, occupation, income, etc -- using a decade-old ML techniques.  In some cases, we can detect which stage of your emotional journey you are in and nudge you towards our target state.  What surprised me about Cambridge Analytica was its ineffectiveness, at least as reported.  There are plenty of teams out there that use these techniques to greatly further their gains, whatever those may be.In Primakov doctrine, information warfare through sowing discontent and/or eroding psychological well-being is very much real and actualizable.  I am not claiming that a foreign government is currently single-handedly controlling TikTok to brainwash the American youth; we do not have conclusive proof of that.  However, the fact that such a tool is in a foreign country's arsenal is itself a massive danger to America's national security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744695</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a common issue with managing BitLocker encryption on Windows devices when a recovery key is needed, particularly when a user has lost access to the PIN or password. It highlights the importance of having backups of recovery keys and provides tips on how to retrieve them from different sources, such as Microsoft accounts or Active Directory. The piece emphasizes the potential risks and complications of being locked out of a device and encourages users to be proactive in managing their encryption settings to avoid being "screwed without a screwdriver."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t understand this design. You should derive the disk’s encryption key from the user’s login password. You have a small, secure program that presents a login screen on boot. It takes the password you input and uses it to unlock the disk. It passes the username and password along to the OS so that it can take you right into your account after it boots.As long as your encryption is decent, this makes it fundamentally impossible to read the drive from a turned-off state without knowing or cracking the password.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we know how to edit a BCD file. But what do we put in there? This was the trickiest part of this exploit chain, as you get very little feedback when things go wrong. Recall the bug we are trying to reproduce: We want the bootloader to attempt to boot from our BitLocker partition, fail, and then trigger a PXE soft reboot into our controlled OS.&gt; The easiest way to get this working has three parts:&gt; Get the original BCD from the victim’s device. This ensures the configuration matches the specific partition GUIDs. You can do that by shift-rebooting Windows, going “Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt”, mounting the boot partition, and copying its contents to a USB drive. Or, be more advanced and use an SMB mount, if you don’t have USB access.Do I understand it correctly that to bypass the encryption you need access to the decrypted contents of the encrypted disk? Did the original exploit guess the layout of the partitions instead?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all correct, but it’s been fairly well known since over 15 years ago that BitLocker only really protects a computer if you configure BitLocker to require a pre-boot password, and also only after you turned off the computer [0].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker#TPM_alone_is_not_eno...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747877</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Outside the boat, Sarah, Hissora and the others who had jumped off eventually found the two life rafts, which had deployed after the sinking. As they clambered on board, they saw the boat's captain and a number of other crew members were already there.&gt; "There should be some supplies in here," Sarah remembers one of the other guests saying. All the people we spoke to recall a safety briefing mentioning that the life rafts had food and water in them - but they did not, the BBC were told.&gt; "We found a torch, but again it didn't have any batteries. We didn't have any water or any food," Sarah says. "There were flares, but they had already been used."&gt; Sarah also says of the three blankets on board the raft, one had been taken by the captain for himself, leaving one for the rest of the crew and another for the guests. "We ripped it up and huddled together," says Sarah.Absolutely disgraceful behavior from the captain here. This is not a person who should be entrusted with a houseplant, let alone the wellbeing of any number of people on board that vessel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of this older story, of Harrison Okene, who was trapped in a capsized boat at the bottom of the ocean for 3 days: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/26/i-survi...video of his rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um1ym9u8XaARandomly, the next year, he rescued his friend when their car goes off a bridge into water. He later became a diver!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After several hours trapped in the air pocket, the dive guide, Youssef, wanted to try to swim through the boat, but Lucianna and Christophe persuaded him not to. "Stay with us because they are going to come to get our bodies, so they will find us," Lucianna recalls telling him.An odd decision, I would have thought he was a good diver, so presumeably also a decent free diver, knew the boat well, could alert rescuers to the trapped people, and would not use up oxygen when gone from the bubble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42707660</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The project "llmpeg" is an open-source library designed to provide a lightweight implementation of the FFmpeg multimedia framework, focusing on simplicity and ease of use for developers. It enables the manipulation and handling of audio and video files through a straightforward API, allowing for tasks such as encoding, decoding, and streaming multimedia content. The repository includes detailed documentation, examples, and installation instructions to help users get started with integrating multimedia functionalities into their applications efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FFMpeg is one of those tools that is really quite hard to use. The sheer surface area of the possible commands and options is incredible and then there is so much arcane knowledge around the right settings. Its defaults aren't very good and lead to poor quality output in a lot of cases and you can get some really weird errors when you combine certain settings. Its an amazingly capable tool but its equipped with every foot gun going.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good that you have a "read" statement to force confirmation by the user of the command, but all it takes is one errant accidental enter to end up running arbitrary code returned from the LLM.I'd constrain the tool to only run "ffmpeg" and extract the options/parameters from the LLM instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i think this type of interaction is the future in lots of areas. i can imagine we replace API's completely with a single endpoint where you hit it up with a description of what you want back. like, hit up 'news.ycombinator.com/api' with "give me all the highest rated submissions over the past week about LLMs". a server side LLM translates that to SQL, executes the query, returns the results.this approach is broadly applicable to lots of domains just like FFMpeg. very very cool to see things moving in this direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42706637</guid></item><item><title>20.

Sokobon itself is three lines of code in this and many other games only need to add one or two more. Its genius. https://www.puzzlescript.net/My goal rn as an art project is to try to combine the two, so every puzzlescript game can be queried for interesting properties in Dusa / Potasscio / Some Logic Language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748534</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Intel's introduction of its new E-Cores as part of the Skymont architecture, which aims to enhance performance and efficiency in processing tasks. It highlights the advancements in technology that enable these cores to improve multitasking capabilities, reduce power consumption, and provide a competitive edge against rival processors. The piece emphasizes the strategic goals behind the development of E-Cores and their potential impact on the future of computing and gaming performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triple decoder is one unique effect. The fact that Intel managed to get them lined up for small loops to do 9x effective instruction issue is basically miraculous IMO. Very well done.Another unique effect is L2 shared between 4 cores. This means that thread communications across those 4 cores has much lower latencies.I've had lots of debates with people online about this design vs Hyperthreading. It seems like the overall discovery from Intel is that highly threaded tasks use less resources (cache, ROPs, etc. etc).Big cores (P cores or AMD Zen5) obviously can split into 2 hyperthread, but what if that division is still too big? E cores are 4 threads of support in roughly the same space as 1 Pcore.This is because L2 cache is shared/consolidated, and other resources (ROP buffers, register files, etc. etc.) are just all so much smaller on the Ecore.It's an interesting design. I'd still think that growing the cores to 4way SMT (like Xeon Phi) or 8way SMT (POWER10) would be a more conventional way to split up resources though. But obviously I don't work at Intel or can make these kinds of decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel advertising the fact that their schedulers can keep MS Teams confined to the efficiency cores... what a sad reflection of how bloated Teams is.We make a single Electron-like app grow, cancer-like, to do everything from messaging and videoconferencing to shared drive browsing and editing, and as a result we have to contain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly off topic, but if I'm aiming to get the fastest 'make -jN' for some random C project (such as the kernel) should I set N = #P [threads] + #E, or just the #P, or something else?  Basically, is there a case where using the E cores slows a compile down?  Or is power management a factor?I timed it on the single Intel machine I have access to with E-cores and setting N = #P + #E was in fact the fastest, but I wonder if that's a general rule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750734</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of identity, emphasizing its complexity and multifaceted nature. It explores how identity is shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural influences, and societal expectations. The author reflects on the continuous evolution of identity throughout one’s life and the importance of self-discovery and authenticity in understanding oneself. Additionally, it highlights the role of digital life in shaping contemporary identities, suggesting that online presence can significantly influence personal and social identities. Overall, the piece encourages readers to engage in thoughtful reflection about their own identities and the factors that contribute to them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the domain name identity model used by AT (so much so I built handles.net[1] for managing domain name based handles) but during my time reading opinions on Bluesky it has become apparent there's a lot more confusion about and distrust towards domain names amongst non-technical people than I previously thought.I thought that people generally understood that domain names are owned and that their provenance can be independently verified (which is why they're valuable for identity) but there's a fairly large and vocal contingent of Bluesky users that are frustrated by domain names, so much so there are multiple efforts to establish a private verification system on Bluesky like verified.quest[2].A lot of people do not want to look at and understand domain names, instead they want to see a name and a check mark. They want a central authority to tell them who is trustworthy and who is not. Domain names are a great solution for technology-adjacent people and I hope that they become more widely accepted, but I'm not too optimistic.I am optimistic and hopeful that AT has a bright future ahead of it. I think AT has a lot going for it... but I do not think that identity will be a part of that. I suspect many apps built on AT will not bother with handles and will just use local display names.[1] https://handles.net
[2] https://verified.quest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Ownership of identityThis isn't currently a reality with ATProto, though they're making important progress over the status quo.Your identity in atproto is your DID. Your domain (if you use one) is just a handle. Currently all DID resolution goes through https://plc.directory, which is completely controlled by Bluesky. Their plan is to eventually have this run more like the DNS by something like a nonprofit, but AFAIK that process hasn't started.The question is if Bluesky turned completely evil today, what recourse would users and app developers have?All the other apps could form a coop for a new DID directory and switch their users over. That might work, but I would like to see something like this in place running alongside Bluesky's directory since the logistics of running such a thing are not obvious.Also, it's not entirely clear to me that running an alternative pseudo-DNS is really better than just using DNS like the fediverse does.One really nice thing about it is that DIDs are opaque values, so squatting should essentially go away. And there's not really any good reason for DIDs to expire like domains do. This is nice for account recovert, since in the worst case if you couldn't prove your identity to the DID registrar your account would just go stale, rather than potentially being taken over by a bad actor[0].[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699099&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ATProto is an interesting technology but the Bluesky app itself is seriously flawed as a Twitter/X competitor.Probably the worst feature is the "nuclear block" which allows a single user to completely disrupt a conversation: if one user blocks any other user in the thread, this removes the blocked user's replies for everyone else reading the thread, and severs the connection between posts so that even if you go directly to a post from the blocked user  you can't see what post they were replying to or any of the rest of the thread above that.There are partial workarounds to this with third-party websites that attempt to piece together the thread from various other API calls, but these aren't perfect and it's annoying to have to do this to understand the context of a conversation full of blocked posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748101</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;BorrowChecker.jl is a Julia package designed to provide borrow checking functionality similar to that found in the Rust programming language. The package aims to help developers manage memory safely by enforcing rules that prevent data races and ensure safe access to mutable state. It incorporates a formal system to check variable borrowing at compile time, aiming to catch potential issues early in the development process. The repository includes documentation for installation and usage, examples of its application, and guidelines for contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its a cute idea but, why does a GC language need this? For shared mutable references across threads I get it for some data race conditions? Can it handle that with awareness of smart pointers, etc?Honestly, I'd write Rust. Or write Julia. Whatever one you want.Kudos on the project though, looks like it was fun to make. Who knows maybe it will evolve into something else that makes more sense to me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This package demonstrates Rust-like ownership and borrowing semantics in Julia through a macro-based system that performs runtime checks. This tool is mainly to be used in development and testing to flag memory safety issues, and help you design safer code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool! I wanted to try implement this idea years ago…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750954</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses TCL's Nxtpaper screen technology, which aims to improve the visual experience on digital devices by using a matte display that mimics the appearance of paper. It highlights the technology's features, such as reduced glare, better eye comfort, and the ability to reflect ambient light, making it more readable in bright conditions. The piece also explores potential applications of Nxtpaper in tablets and other devices, emphasizing its importance in enhancing user interaction and reducing digital eye strain compared to traditional glossy screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that individual use of artificial intelligence (AI) isn't inherently detrimental to society, countering the notion that personal AI applications lead to negative societal impacts. It explores how individual engagement with AI can foster innovation, improve productivity, and contribute to personal and professional development. The author emphasizes that the responsible use of AI technology—rather than its mere existence—determines its effects on society, advocating for a balanced perspective on individual AI practices while acknowledging the need for ethical considerations and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One miss in this post is that the author tries to make their point by comparing energy consumption of LLMs to arbitrary points of reference. We should be comparing them to their relevant parallels.Comparing a ChatGPT query to an hour long Zoom call isn't useful. The call might take up ~1700 mL of water, but that is still wildly more efficient than what we used to do prior - travel/commute to meet in person. The "10x a Google search" point is relevant because for many of the use cases mentioned in this post and others like it (e.g. "try asking factual questions!"), you could just as easily get that with 1 Google search and skimming the results.I have found use for LLMs in software development, but I'd be lying if I said I couldn't live without it. Almost every use case of an LLM has a simple alternative - often just employing critical thinking or learning a new skill.It feels like this post is a long way of saying "yes, there are negative impacts, but I value my time more".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet we also see that hyperscale cloud emissions targets have been reversed due to AI investment, Datacenter growth is hitting grid capacity limits in many regions, and peaker plant and other non-renewable resources on the grid are being deployed more to handle this specific growth from AI.  I think the author, by qualifying on "chatgpt" maybe can make the claims they are making but I don't believe the larger argument would hold for AI as a whole or when you convert the electricity use to emissions.I'm personally on the side that the ROI will probably work out in the long run but not by minimizing the potential impact and keeping the focus on how we can make this technology (currently in its infancy) more efficient.
[edit wording]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great article for discussion.  However articles like this must link to references.  It is one thing to assert, another to prove.  I do agree that heating/cooling, car and transport use, and diet play massive roles in climate change that should not be subsumed by other debates.The flip side to the authors argument is that LLMs are not only used by home users doing 20 searches a day.  Governments and Mega-Corporations are chewing through GPU hours on god-knows-what.  New nuclear and other power facilities are being proposed to power their use, this is not insignificant. Schneider Electric predicts 93 GW of energy spent on AI by 2028. https://www.powerelectronicsnews.com/schneider-electric-pred...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745847</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Hilbert curves, a type of space-filling curve that can cover a two-dimensional area entirely without any gaps or overlaps. It explores the mathematical properties of these curves, including their recursive construction and the concept of mapping one-dimensional data to two-dimensional spaces. The text also highlights potential applications of Hilbert curves, such as in image processing and data visualization, and provides visual examples to illustrate how these curves behave and their implications in various fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For want of a better term, I've called this Zigzag order.I learned this has a technical name: the zigzag order is called “Boustrophedonic”, after the Ancient Greek tablets where they wrote right-to-left on one line, then left-to-right on the next. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoustrophedonIt totally depends on the specifics of your application, but a little while ago, I compared Hilbert to both Boustrophedonic and Morton order, and surprisingly, Boustrophedonic was the winner. My application was partitioning a 3d grid into blocks of active voxels where each block could be represented efficiently with only a range (pair) of indices. It’s surprising at first that the zig-zag sometimes has better locality than Hilbert or Morton.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun article, but the example of Hilbert Curve usefulness with hard drives is quickly aging out. SSDs, which are increasingly prevalent, have more-or-less constant access time. There is no equivalent of the seek time or rotational latency that slows down HHD access when successive reads are on different tracks, at different rotational angles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilbert curves are used in modern data lakehouse storage optimisation techniques, such as Databricks' "liquid clustering" [1]. This can replace the need for more traditional "hive-style" partitioning, in which the data files are partitioned based on a folder structure (e.g. `mydatafiles/YYYY/MM/DD/`).1. https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744932</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sometimes chuckle that most of the cool Lexuses are now Priuses under the hood!But that’s a good thing. I own a Toyota Corolla hybrid myself, and hybrids are one of those things that I can say I’ve completely changed my mind about. I used to dislike the idea of hybrids, because I assumed that the overall system complexity must be higher than either an ICE, or an EV. And I’m a sucker for simple systems, so I thought it’s either EV, or nothing.Then I looked into how hybrids work. Specifically Toyota hybrids. And came away totally amazed. It’s an amazing system, and much simpler than a traditional ICE car. It doesn’t really have a gearbox, or a clutch, or a starter. The engine is a normal atmospheric engine, so no turbines, overcompression, and the issues that come with it. Furthermore, the engine is typically configured to use the Atkinson cycle, which puts less stress on it. And, the engine has a chain drive, so no belts to change, and by design gets stressed a lot less than in a traditional ICE, because the stop-start load is carried by the electric motor. Also, it can’t really have trouble starting in cold weather, much like an EV. All of that boils down to crazy reliability.I’m at a point where if I’m looking for a car that uses fuel, it’s only cars that use the Toyota hybrid tech (or similar) that I’m looking at. At the moment it’s just Toyota, Lexus, most Ford hybrids (but not all).Other companies have hybrids that are liable to my original concerns about massively increased complexity. As an example, VW hybrids have an electric motor within their DSG gearbox. So you have all the complexity of their modern  ICEs (turbines, DSG, whatnot) plus additional hybrid related complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new Prius is really good-looking (to my eye at least), especially in person: I don't think the photos (I've seen) do it justice. Fun comparisons to the car  Burt Reynolds drove in Smokey and the Bandit: Compared to the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am:   - The Prius is as fast 0-60 (~7 seconds)
   - The Prius has nearly the same top speed (~115 mph)
   - The Prius is 4x(!) as fuel-efficient (57mpg vs. 12-16mpg)
   - The Prius has all the modern stuff: air conditioning, antilock brakes, airbags, crumple zones, information display screen, backup camera, proximity alerts, etc. etc.
   - Adjusted for inflation, the Prius costs almost exactly the same&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love my Prius. What amazes me about the car is how “idiot-proof” or “smart” it is. I try my best to hypermile and squeeze out every last MPG, while my wife doesn’t make any effort to baby it—and yet, we both consistently get about 57 MPG combined. The car adapts to how you drive it, which is really impressive.I think Toyota deserves as much credit as Apple for its “it just works” ethos. The way they design the technology to be seamless and work so well behind the scenes is remarkable. Additionally, many Toyota mechanics consider the Prius to be the most reliable car Toyota makes. This often surprises people because of the perceived complexity of hybrids, but in reality, they are elegantly engineered and surprisingly simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747899</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach to improving network security by introducing a new method for securely executing processes without relying on traditional operating system features that are vulnerable to exploitation. It highlights a specific security technique called "flight," which allows code execution in a protected environment, mitigating risks associated with memory corruption and similar attacks. The author emphasizes the importance of developing more robust systems that prioritize security in contemporary computing environments, showcasing the potential benefits of this innovative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

But key agreement doesn't tell the parties why they should trust each other; you need signatures and certificates for that, and those will need to be PQ-ready too.That part is much harder, for both technical (larger certificates implied by most PQ signing schemes are much harder to reliably convey over packet networks) and political (the X.509 ecosystem moves very slowly, and penetration of new signature schemes takes years) reasons.[1]: Nothing about it is easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Scott Aaronson talk he links at the bottom[1], Prof. Aaronson says&gt; A fourth reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself... Or they say things like, “complex Hilbert space in 2^n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality”—the kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.How is that a failure to take intellectual responsibility?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the relevance of traditional natural language processing (NLP) in the current landscape dominated by deep learning models. It explores how advancements like transformer architecture and large language models (LLMs) have shifted the focus away from classical techniques. However, the author argues that traditional NLP approaches still possess value, particularly for specific tasks and applications where they can be more efficient and interpretable than complex models. The piece emphasizes a balanced view, suggesting that both traditional and modern methods can coexist and complement each other in the evolving field of NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No, it has not and will not in the foreseeable future. This is one of my responsibilities at work. LLMs are not feasible when you have a dataset of 10 million items that you need to classify relatively fast and at a reasonable cost. LLMs are great at mid-level complexity tasks given a reasonable volume of data - they can take away the tedious job of figuring out what you are looking at or even come up with some basic mapping. But anything at large volumes.. Na. Real life example: "is '20 bottles of ferric chloride' a service or a product?"One prompt? Fair. 10? Still ok. 100? You're pushing it. 10M - get help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For my use case, definitely.I have worked on AWS Connect (online call center) and Amazon Lex (the backing NLP engine) projects.Before LLMs, it was a tedious process of trying to figure out all of the different “utterances” that people could say and the various languages you had to support.  With LLMs, it’s just promptinghttps://chatgpt.com/share/678bab08-f3a0-8010-82e0-32cff9c0b4...I used something like this using Amazon Bedrock and a Lambda hook for Amazon Lex.  Of course it wasn’t booking a flight. It was another systemThe above is a simplified version.  In the real world , I gave it a list of intents (book flights, reserve a room, rent a car) and properties - “slots” - I needed for each intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question seems malformed to me.Text classification, clustering, named entity recognition, etc. are NLP tasks.  LLMs can perform these tasks.  ML models that are not LLMs (or even not deep learning models) can also perform these tasks.  Is the author perhaps asking if the concept of a "completion" has replaced all of these tasks?When I hear "traditional NLP" I think not of the above types of tasks but rather the methodology employed for performing them.  For example, building a pipeline to do stemming/lemmatization, part of speech tagging, coreference resolution, etc. before the text gets fed to a classifier model.  This was SOTA 10 years ago but I don't think many people are still doing it today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708291</guid></item><item><title>33.

So either this should be "... unless there was no other option", or I'm completely misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the way the system is rigged to the wall of the station is quite humorous to me in how it is taking full advantage of being weightless. From the arm the camera is attached to the tracker, and then the tracker being mounted to the one arm just seems like it would collapse on itself if it were on terra firma.I've seen some crazy/shitty rigging done, but this one gets a pass because it's in spaaaaaaaace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat.Debbie Downer: Looks like it fairly easily could have been made with like 50% less mass.Perhaps that wouldn't have mattered though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42701645</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses post-timing attacks, which are a form of side-channel attack that exploit the timing information associated with cryptographic operations. It explains how these attacks can leak sensitive information by measuring the time it takes to execute certain operations, particularly in systems using cryptographic algorithms. The article highlights various methods of mitigation to protect against such timing attacks, including constant-time implementations and other countermeasures. It emphasizes the importance of secure coding practices and raises awareness about the risks posed by timing discrepancies in cryptographic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A note on the Thompson sampling: classic TS is optimizing for regret, while the goal here is to identify the 'best arm' (ie. the actual secret value at that position - it's like a 0/1 loss). There is no partial credit in getting part of a password correct, it still won't work. So it's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit#Best_Arm_Id...You can tweak the Thompson sampling to handle best-arm, like https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publica... "Ordered-Statistic Thompson Sampling". I am not sure if the pseudocode TS presented by OP winds up doing the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the author:
"Benchmarking page to choose good parameters..." seems to spin forever and I don't feel the device getting warm. Don't have an error console on mobile so not sure what's up but this is on an Android webview browser. Maybe add an onerror event handler to at least show the user this spinner is going nowhere?Edit: wait, it did complete now that I've not used the skip to demo link and read the article. "Benchmark complete! Using 29000 iterations". Maybe mention that it can take several minutes on a modern device? Or a progress indicator?Now that I'm running the password guesser, the device does get warm in the usual spot for cpu load. Cool way to visualise the method! After five minutes, 6 out of 10 guesses have the right first character, and of those, 2 the right second character. Am I extrapolating correctly if I guess it'll need to do this 4 more times so some 20 minutes? Battery use is 30%./hour currently so about 10% of a full charge would be 1.1 WhEdit2: the number of correct prefixes is decreasing after 10~15 minutes. This will take forever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of timing side channel attacks in general. With VUSEC (VU University Amsterdam) we did flush/reload side channel attacks. I don't remember the specifics, I did this in 2018.But yea, basically if a cache hit versus a memory roundtrip will result in different time values, then you can iterate over all 256 bytes (assuming ASCII) and when you have a cache hit for a specific value, the time should be much lower.However, this also assumes you understand cache internals of the specific CPU and it means you need to know when caches fill up, why they fill up and how to do cache eviction. Knowing how to do cache eviction means that you need to know how many elements can be cached, and if I recall correctly that means you need to reverse engineer the cache size of the CPU. But once you can reliable evict values from the cache set and reliably fill them up, then the rough outline I mentioned above is possible.Again, this is like 50% accurate since it has been a long while and I currently work in marketing as a data analyst (I like a mix of fluffy marketing/psychology talk and being deeply technical - if you feel the same way, feel free to reach out. My email is on my profile). There's some of what I described on this website (and a whole bunch more) [1]. I think the reverse engineering of cache lines was specifically in the accompanied paper.[1] https://www.vusec.net/projects/glitch/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708212</guid></item><item><title>35.

There's the 'we wanted to do this thing but you're already doing it' merge. There's the 'let's be a monopoly!' merge, and its sibling, 'you are getting in the way of my aspirations to be a monopoly' merge. There's the quiet merge to deal with debts, the making-it-formal-but-functionally-we-were-already-merged, the hey-that-collaboration-went-well merge, and many more.And then there's this merge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perplexity sounds desperate. They got early traction and have money but they seem to be lost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My cousin also submitted a bid to merge with TikTok, not sure why that’s not being reported on?!?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42751649</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work at a worker-owned IT company that has offices in three states and has been in existence for 20 years. We do not provide any kind of SaaS service but I can assure you it is possible! My suggestion is to reach out to the Tech Worker Coop Peer Network for the USFWC:https://www.usworker.coop/programs/peer-networks/They will probably have ideas. 
Good luck!PS an LLC is definitely a good way to go, but some states (e.g. NY, MA, CA, MN, etc) have dedicated worker coop company types you can create.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might be interested in Subvert, a group of people (formerly?) from Bandcamp that are now founding a worker-/artist-owned version of Bandcamp and launching the platform soon. They basically want to avoid running into the same issues that came with Bandcamp’s recent ownership changes and the instability and worker-facing hostilities around it.They also published a magazine explaining their thinking behind the setup, etc. – you can find out more on their website: https://subvert.fm/Could be interesting to check out, even if just for inspiration or fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I established a limited liability company (LLC) for a business venture initiated with friends. My objective was to ensure that all contributors received a fair share of the equity while maintaining a simplified structure for tax purposes. Additionally, I wanted to ensure that equity shares did not confer voting rights, functioning instead as profit-sharing interests. Legal counsel assisted in structuring the entity as a single-member LLC, where I am the sole owner, with profit-sharing units allocated to other contributors. This arrangement entitles contributors to a defined percentage of the company’s profits and proceeds from events such as a sale of the company.My only regret is that I spent a lot of money on legal fees and the company ended up not being profitable so a lot of the work went to waste. But now I can re-use the structure again if I wish to create a new venture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748394</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Generative Adversarial Nets" presents a novel framework for training generative models using a process involving two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity against real data samples. This adversarial process leads to improved performance in generating high-quality data, with applications in various domains including image generation and unsupervised learning. The authors describe the mathematical foundations and empirical results of their model, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing realistic data distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google announced a significant change to its search engine by requiring websites to support JavaScript to be indexed effectively. This move aims to enhance the user experience by ensuring that dynamic content, which relies on JavaScript for rendering, is fully accessible in search results. Webmasters and developers are encouraged to adapt their sites accordingly to maintain visibility on Google Search, as failure to comply could lead to reduced indexing of their web pages. The article discusses the implications of this requirement for the web development community and highlights the importance of optimizing websites for both performance and searchability.&lt;/p&gt;

The rest are from bots, and not like people who haven't found I have an API, but bots that are attempting to poison Google or Bing's query suggestions (even though I'm not backed by either).  From what I've heard from other people running search engines, it looks the same everywhere.I don't know what Google's ratio of human to botspam is, but given how much of a payday it would be if anyone were to succeed, I can imagine they're serving their fair number of automated requests.Requiring a headless browser to automate the traffic makes the abuse significantly more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tested (ignoring AI search engines, non-english, non-free):Search engines which require JavaScript:Google, Bing, Ecosia, Yandex, Qwant, Gibiru, Presearch, Seekr, Swisscows, Yep, Openverse, Dogpile, WaldoSearch engines which do not require JavaScript:DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Search, Brave Search, Startpage, AOL Search, giveWater, Mojeek&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've put off learning JavaScript for over 20 years, now I'm not going to be able to search for anything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42747092</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the emulation of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) using finite element methods. It explores the challenges and methodologies involved in replicating GPU functionalities within a CPU environment, aiming to enhance computing efficiency for specific tasks commonly handled by GPUs. The author presents theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, highlighting the potential benefits and performance metrics of this approach. Additionally, the article emphasizes the applicability of this emulation in various computational fields, proposing it as a viable alternative when GPU resources are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction : 
Finite Field Assembly is a programming language that lets you emulate GPUs on CPUsIt's a CUDA alternative that uses finite field theory to convert GPU kernels to prime number fields.Finite Field is the primary data structure : FF-asm is a CUDA alternative designed for computations over finite fields.Recursive computing support : not cache-aware vectorization, not parallelization, but performing a calculation inside a calculation inside another calculation.Extension of C89 - runs everywhere gcc is available.
Context : I'm getting my math PhD and I built this language around my area of expertise, Number Theory and Finite Fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I get it. You're using the Ring isomorphism from the Chinese Remainder Theorem to do "parallel computation". This is the same principle as how boolean algebra on binary strings computes the pairwise results of each bit in parallel. Unfortunately, there's no free lunch - if you want to perform K operations on N-bit integers in parallel, you still need to work with (K * N)-bit-wide vectors, which is essentially what SIMD does anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the more subtle aspects of retargeting GPU code to run on the CPU is the presence of fine grained(read - block level and warp level) explicit synchronization mechanisms being available in the GPU. However, this is not the same in CPU land, so additional care has to be taken to handle this. One example of work which tries this is https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00257 .Interestingly, in the same work, contrary to what you’d expect, transpiling GPU code to run on CPU gives ~76% speedups in HPC workloads compared to a hand optimized multi-core CPU implementation on Fugaku(a CPU only supercomputer), after accounting for these differences in synchronization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42695414</guid></item><item><title>41.

It is great for solving the kinds of math, coding and logic puzzles it has been designed for, but for many kinds of tasks, including chat and creative writing, it is actually worse than 4o. It is good at the specific kinds of reasoning tasks that it was built for, much like alpha-go is great at playing go, but that does not actually mean it is more generally intelligent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of luck using 4o to build and iterate on context and then carry that into o1. I’ll ask 4o to break down concepts, make outlines, identify missing information and think of more angles and options. Then at the end, switch on o1 which can use all that context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750096</guid></item><item><title>42.

Sadly, it was meant to only print text, and having a fancy typewriter definitely wasn't very much fun to me. Somehow, I figured out that the printer actually supported defining custom fonts! After some reverse-engineering of the format I ended up with a program to slice the screen into rectangles matching printer's letter sizes (which were not 8x8 pixels, to make it extra fun) and sending them as custom font definition for each symbol of the alphabet, then printing "ABCD..."Getting a paper printout of loading screens or in-game screenshot art was mind-blowing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why’s the Spectrum’s screen layout different from, say, a C64? The explanation on the page sounds a lot like the 64’s.(Not trying to sound snarky, but curious.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the implications of a potential TikTok ban in the United States, questioning whether such a move could lead to a broader re-evaluation of internet governance and the digital landscape. It discusses concerns about privacy, national security, and the influence of large tech companies while highlighting the complexities of regulating social media platforms. The author argues that rather than simply banning individual apps, there is an opportunity to rethink the structure and principles that underpin the internet as a whole, fostering a more secure and equitable digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course it's a chance to rethink the internet. COVID was also a chance to rethink our responses to pandemics. Cambridge Analytica was a chance to rethink data privacy as it relates to private companies. Edward Snowden was a chance to rethink data privacy as it relates to governments. Climate Change is a chance to rethink how we live our lives, build our cities, and produce our food. In my hometown, an earthquake was a chance to rethink how the city worked.Life is full of these chances, but we seldom take them. Whatever happens with TikTok, it'll be business as usual in no time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting trend I've noticed: Tiktok's users tend to like its algorithm, and its probably the app's most valuable assets, but western tech executives tend to hate it and speak of it with derision.This stands in stark contrast with US-based social media companies, where both its users and content creators often speak like they're at war with the algorithm, yet to the tech elite these sites algorithms are tuned to perfection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RSS was too good and too decentralized to exist. It's a miracle that it's still possible to independently publish and subscribe to podcasts (notably, Spotify doesn't let you subscribe to unapproved podcasts).I social web based on RSS would be heaven: publish anywhere you want, own your content and URL, no content moderation, pick your own service (separately) for discovery. Google should be pushing harder for this to bust content back out of the walled gardens of Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745082</guid></item><item><title>44.

Strangers machines that you trust enough to connect to your servers, and are able to install putty or your preferred ssh client of choice on? Better just have SSH on your own phone and laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42745876</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only given it a skim read so far but this looks like a really nice write up and it's a fantastic piece of work. Laser fault injection is a very powerful attack so great to see it becoming more accessible through work like this (or terrible if you're someone relying on security of hardware that considers LFI to be a highly advanced technique that it doesn't need to defend against...).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much more complicated than the Cullen's hack at CCC, but I think that also required a bit of luck. This was an very interesting read in terms of solid research experimentation setup. We now have two really nice attacks on the RP2350 secure boot, and only a few months after release.The Cullen observation that the OTP power supply wasn't being glitch detected was pretty damning and a much more devastating attack in practice. If you require decapping and lasers, anything is possible.Thanks for the write-up!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related but could this setup be used for laser micro drilling? I've been wondering if there are ways to do it quick and dirty by brute forcing the reality with the fact that the year is 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708682</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Path of Our Lives" by Steve Blank discusses the importance of understanding and reflecting on the personal and professional journey individuals take throughout their lives. Blank emphasizes that each person's path is unique and shaped by experiences, challenges, and decisions. He encourages readers to consider how their past influences their current choices and future aspirations. The piece serves as a reminder to be intentional about one's life trajectory and to learn from both successes and failures in order to create a meaningful and fulfilling future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I too have survivorship bias that I try to explain away with self serving theories and ideas that pit my special nature against the tendencies of the inferior masses. In my case I literally survived alcoholism after I was lucky enough to come out alive after an accident. I used this as motivation to do the hard work of getting and staying sober. My brain sometimes tells me that I have some special power of “working hard enough to change myself” that has also helped me become an entrepreneur and make other positive changes in my life. I tell myself people sometimes fail because they didn’t go through this and can’t work hard enough to change themselves for the better. In reality it all comes down to luck and circumstance that I was fortunate enough to take advantage of.In this post the author tries to set up an unassailable scenario where two very similar people end up with strikingly different life outcomes because of “how some of us have chosen to live their lives.” Conveniently, the author is the successful one because he is part of “a small set of humans who don’t act like their lives are predestined.” The majority, and the person he compares himself to, obviously couldn’t succeed without this special character aspect. In reality, it’s the “small set of humans” part that shows the way to the truth. The analysis that says successful people are different because they chose to act differently and not live a “predestined” life ignores all the people who also made that choice without getting lucky and achieving success. It also leaves out the people who lived a “predestined” life and succeeded despite their lack of willpower or special abilities or whatever else we can point to as an explanation.Like I said, I am victim to the same fallacies in my own reasoning about my life, but I try very hard to overcome them or at least recognize them. The takeaway from this article isn’t that “you are the master of your own fate” but instead something like “be careful when trying to explain your own life’s circumstances, especially when your explanations put you in some special class that only few people have achieved.” Luck, by its very nature, is only for the few.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"But what we know with certainty is that there is a small set of humans who don’t act like their lives are predestined. For better or worse, regardless of circumstances, country or culture they struggle their entire lives wanting to change the outcome. And a small percentage of these translate the “wanting to change” into acting on it. This small group is dissatisfied with waiting for life to hand them their path. They act, they do, they move, they change things."Oh! I wish I could live by the storytelling and narrative that this gentleman does!He thinks there is no such thing of a predestined life but he is actually predestined to think that way. And then he blames those who are not predestined and forces them to work in an Amazon warehouse and sleep in their car.Look at his sprawling estate he wants us all to see right there at the top of his blog! His ego!It sounds like his friend Glen is the guy I want to be around, ans Steve seems to think that it might not have been lucky for him that "we were both sent to bases in different parts of the U.S."This is the equation I will leave you with.Success = hard work + LuckLuck is an uncontrolled variable, so success is uncontrollable. If anyone can refute that logic please do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42699370</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses TikTok's recent decision to temporarily cease operations in the U.S. due to mounting regulatory scrutiny and security concerns. It highlights the challenges the platform faces amidst increasing pressure from lawmakers about data privacy and its ties to China. The piece notes the potential impact on users and businesses that have come to rely on the app for communication and marketing, while also exploring TikTok's efforts to address these issues with transparency and engagement with U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

TikTok has easily more influence than most TV channels so it does not seem strange to limit its foreign ownership. If the purchase of US steel by a Japanese company threatens national security, surely the ownership of TikTok is also one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A point I think most people don’t understand is that the government interest in TikTok has little to do with exploiting user data per se, a lot of other companies do that. The issue is that TikTok is somewhat unique in being aggressively weaponized in currently very active “grey zone” conflicts.This has been an open secret in national security circles but the average person on the street has no idea what a grey zone conflict is, what it looks like, or why it matters. Geopolitic strategies are increasingly executed as grey zone warfare, and some hybrid warfare, because the costs and risks of traditional overt warfare have become unacceptably high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753396</guid></item><item><title>2.

A fork of Gitea [0] but managed via a non profit, no premium upsells, all freely licensed [1](GPL) etc.Good to see their community outreach is via Matrix and Mastadon. My kind of nerds.Apparently this is what Codeberg is running out, if you click . Looks like gitea/github to me, nothing wrong with that [2] source code is available from the little branch icon in the top right corner, hosted on codeberg which TIL is a forgejo instance [3][0] https://forgejo.org/2024-02-forking-forward/[1] https://forgejo.org/2024-08-gpl/[2] https://v10.next.forgejo.org/explore/repos[3] https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got curious about why Forgejo split off from Gitea, and it seems like yet another case of broke FOSS creators/maintainers getting screwed from above (and maybe below too).From the Gitea incorporation announcement (below), it looks like they couldn't pay their bills as FOSS, and there were wealthy free-riders (which the MIT license allows).&gt; "Over the years we have tried various ways to support maintainers and the project. Some ways we have tried include bounties, direct donations, grants, and a few others. We have found that while there have been many wonderful individuals, and a few corporations who have been incredibly generous, and we are so thankful for their support, there are a few corporations (with revenues that are greater than some countries GDP) are building on Gitea for core products without even contributing back enhancements. [emphasis added]I'm not a fan of Bruce Perens, but he kind of nails the problem when he says:&gt; "We have a great corporate welfare program, our users are the richest companies in the world. Indeed, we've enabled companies like Google to be created.&gt; "In contrast, if our developers aren't working for those companies, they probably go un-compensated."----On the flip side, the community rebelled when the creators formed a company, but not supposedly because they formed a company, but because that co held the domain and trademark. Seems like a small hill to die on to me, but I don't know the details.Regardless, it looks like exhibit #187 of FOSS failing for anyone outside of hobbyists and FAANGs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fedora Project (Linux) is switching to this, FWIW https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-moves-towards-forgejo-a-un...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753523</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of procedural programming within the context of Haskell, a functional programming language. It highlights the differences between procedural and functional programming paradigms, emphasizing how Haskell, despite its functional nature, can still support procedural styles through techniques such as monads and IO actions. The author explores practical implications and examples of writing procedural code in Haskell, aiming to bridge the understanding for programmers coming from a procedural background by demonstrating how Haskell can be employed in a more imperative style when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; and (c) requires a language feature (sequence points) to disambiguate in which order side effects get executed. With Haskell, we just don’t have to care.Reading up to this point, I had to chuckle a bit. I have struggled with the Haskell type system more than I care to admit; It's almost never "we just don't have to care" when comparing to most other popular languages.That being said, this article does a nice job of gently introducing some of the basics that will trip up somebody who is casually looking through code wondering what *&gt; and &lt;*&gt; and &lt;* do. As usual, there is a steep learning curve because of stuff like this all over the codebase. If I walk away for a month, I need to revisit &gt;&gt;= vs &gt;&gt; and other common operators before I can be productive. It probably doesn't help that I never actually speak to a human about these concepts so in my head it's always "&gt;&gt;=" and not "bind."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way I think about effectful computation and IO in Haskell is as a kind of enforced metaprogramming. The actual language comprises a strongly typed meta-layer used to assemble an imperative program from opaque primitives. Like all powerful metaprogramming systems, this allows doing things you cannot easily do in a first-order imperative language. On the other hand, this makes all the 99% of simple stuff you don't have to even think about in an imperative language necessarily roundabout, and imposes a steep learning curve. Which contributes to the empirical fact that not many people are rushing to use Haskell, the superior imperative language, in real-world projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gave a talk that goes more into what makes imperative programming better with Haskell compared to traditional imperative languages. https://speakerdeck.com/ajnsit/supercharged-imperative-progr...In a nutshell, first class effects and built in set of patterns for composing them get rid of boilerplate code. Combine that with type safety and you can churn out relatively bug free code very fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42754098</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how the Unix spell-checking program operates efficiently within a constrained memory environment of just 64KB RAM. It provides insights into the design and implementation of the program, highlighting the algorithms and data structures that enable it to function effectively even with limited resources. The author delves into the history and evolution of the program, illustrating how its lightweight nature allows for fast processing and reliable performance in text correction tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can write an external memory spell checker with a tiny amount of RAM:  something like   - sort the words in the document
   - eliminate unique words (they sort together)
   - merge the sorted words with the sorted dictionary and keep only the missing words

I saw this in BASIC in Creative Computing and got it working in on my TRS-80 Color Computer which had much less than 32k of available RAM,  so that was the first thing I thought when I saw the headline.Now this blew people away when it came outhttps://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-lightning/1xit had a compressed dictionary that would fit together with the other programs you were running on a PC and spell check as you typed;  there was a 640k limit for the PC but it could only use a fraction of that so as not to interfere and in the early days of the PC you couldn't actually afford to fill it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; At this time, Bloom filter was not even called Bloom filter. In his paper, Douglas calls it a “superimposed code scheme”.A Bloom filter is a specific type of superimposed code.Calvin Mooers developed random (1) superimposed coding in his Master's thesis at MIT back in the 1940s, directly influenced by Shannon's work.Bourne's superb 1963 book "Methods of Information Handling" gives details of the mathematics.I've no doubt Douglas knew about the broader technique, which, for example, the author of "The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma" (1975) at http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci60001a005 described as "an old technique called super-imposed coding".(1) The "random" is an important qualifier because there were superimposed codes predating Mooers, but they were not mathematically interesting or all that practically important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Way too smart for worse is better. Think Worser!The main memory bandwidth and the disk bandwidth were about the same, a little of 1MB/s.I would have done this in multiple passes (but still used the Bloom Filters, those are cool).https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/v10spellhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/unix-spell/The original paper is great https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Development-of-a-Spell...It is hosted on his web page https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroyIf you are a word nerd, you will have found obovate and there, this chart.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Leaf_mor...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752604</guid></item><item><title>5.

It analyzes the implications of these restrictions for fan engagement and media coverage during the tournament, highlighting how such measures could stifle creativity and limit the ways in which the event is presented to the audience.

In the USA, the licensing notices specifically prohibit use of even "the descriptions" that appear in a broadcast.I suppose they'll close that loophole in other countries.The whole regime is a big F-U to fans, and to the taxpayers who subsidize these teams out the wazoo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like watching random sports on YouTube so saw this yesterday. I could only manage a minute, it was just bizarre. It did make me wonder how I could watch the Australia Open, but I wasn't willing to subscribe to ESPN to see it.Not bad advertising really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this harm the long-term value of AOs rights sales to the broadcasters?If I know AO is going to broadcast on youtube, why am I as a European broadcaster going to pay them the same amount as I did when they weren't trying to work against me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42719498</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the public preview of an evolving GitHub Issues experience, which introduces several new features aimed at improving user interaction and project management. Key enhancements include a redesigned user interface, support for customizable templates, better organization of issues through labels and milestones, and improved search functionality. These updates are intended to streamline workflows, facilitate collaboration among users, and ultimately enhance productivity within GitHub projects. The preview invites user feedback to further refine the features before a wider rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 50 trillion of begging Github for a functional notification system so I can stop receiving infinite numbers of emails from all the bots and similar things commenting on PRs.Also being designated a codeowner in a large repo, the number of notifications I get daily from the number of PRs is fucking absurd, with no way of turning them off. Drives me up the wall daily. If a colleague doesn't straight up send me a PR in a DM, I'll basically never see it because I've given up on the notification screen a looooong time ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A GitHub feature I think would be really handy is suggesting duplicate issues when writing up a new issues. Many projects ask that you search for already reported tickets, but GitHub's current search isn't great if you aren't sure what you are looking for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think of GitHub as a sad story. There are probably going to be at least 3 public companies that should have "just" been GitHub features: GitLab (GitHub Enterprise), Sourcegraph (search), and Linear (GitHub Issues). There are dozens of upstarts "unbundling" features of GitHub that are genuinely useful, but which are under-loved and under-invested in, and surely some of those will become successful too. It feels like GitHub continuously invents the future, and then waits for someone else to make it truly great.It is so painful to watch because I love GitHub so much. I graduated college in 2013, which means I started programming right when they got started. I read their dev blog every single day, eagerly waiting for new features (which were released every couple days). I watched their team page grow, I looked carefully at what they did to deserve a spot at such a cool company. I scoured the projects they contributed back to for hints about what good code looked like (my favorite was Vicent Martí's contributions to libgit2). I eagerly taught my friends how to use git because university taught subversion. I wrote my own Rails tutorials as a way to learn the magic.But it's been years now, and it's not an easy love. It's work! It's so painful to watch it get continuously lapped by upstarts. I always just thought the core offerings (Pull Requests and Issues) would get better eventually. And now, 14 years later, they finally are. But very slowly. I really want to believe, but after 16 years, it is starting to sink in that GitHub might just be a place to store files.The magic is still in there. I think there are lots of people like me, who want to believe. But it will take real agency to do it, and that's really hard to muster at this stage in a company's life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725692</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of building a database from scratch in just 3000 lines of code, emphasizing the importance of understanding the fundamentals of database functionality. It outlines the essential components of a database, such as data storage, retrieval, and management, and provides insights into the programming techniques and algorithms that can be employed to create a simple yet effective database system. The author aims to demystify the process and encourage developers to explore database creation as a practical exercise in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

JPEG 2000 lets you zoom in and access higher levels of detail without reading the whole file. Or not zoom in and read a low-rez version from a small part of the file. So it's good for map data.Deep zooming doesn't come up much in web usage, and browsers don't support JPEG 2000.The JPEG 2000 decoder situation isn't good. OpenJPEG is slow and has had several reported vulnerabilities. There are better expensive decoders, and GPUs can be used to help with decoding, but the most popular decoders are slow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm amused by how quickly he shifts from "all existing image viewers have silly bugs, no-one knows what they're doing, I want to understand everything" to "here's some code I copy-pasted that seems to work". What a deeply quixotic approach to, uh, everything in this blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From his footnotes:&gt; I was able to find a reasonable amount of AVIF HDR images, but HEIC HDR is nowhere to be found.Anything taken by an iPhone camera is an HDR HEIF image… sort of. For backwards compatibility reasons it's an SDR image with an additional attached image called a gain map that HDRifies it. (This is mathematically worse for a reason I don't remember; it causes any picture taken at a concert with blacklights or blue spotlights to look bad. Once you see this you'll never unsee it.)I believe the very newest Sony cameras can also save HEIF images, however I don't feel like spending $2500 to upgrade my second-to-newest A7 to a newest A7 to find out.Lightroom also recently added HDR editing so maybe it can export them now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42730512</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The Fuzzing Book is a comprehensive resource dedicated to the art and science of fuzz testing, a technique used to identify vulnerabilities in software applications. It provides a thorough introduction to fuzzing concepts, methodologies, and tools, including practical examples and detailed explanations. The content is designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners, covering topics such as input generation, test case creation, and the design of fuzzing engines. Additionally, the book emphasizes hands-on learning with exercises and code samples, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to enhance their software security practices through effective fuzz testing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An API fuzzer I've been building for several years now: https://github.com/Endava/cats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just reading about these whacky German's yesterday, after investigating a particularly undescriptive (and still available 20 years after it's last update) PKG in pacman. It was the tool/framework/concept that these guys used in the mid to late 90s to fuzz those 2k+ bugs out of Netscape Navigator like they mention in the article. 
Rather ingenious that it's fuzzing technique allowed them to not only isolate bugs without really knowing what behavior triggered it, but it would automatically narrow it down to the specific line of code at fault. I'm not really doing it justice, even less so because I can't remember the name of that tool/framework/technique.... Definitely made me rethink my understanding of how under lying systems architecture and code actually interact, and what a "bug" truly is. 
So anyway, tl;dr, a coincidence happened to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also Fuzzing 101: https://github.com/antonio-morales/Fuzzing101&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756286</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Yek is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to enhance the performance of Python applications by allowing users to run scripts in parallel across multiple CPU cores. It simplifies the process of executing tasks concurrently, helps in improving the efficiency of data processing, and supports easy configuration for various job types. The tool facilitates a streamlined workflow for developers looking to optimize their Python scripts without delving into complex multiprocessing code. The repository provides detailed documentation, examples, and installation instructions for easy integration into existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is where the future of coding is. It is still useful to be a coder, the more experienced the better. But you will not write or edit a lot of lines anymore. You will organize the codebase in a way AI can handle it, make architectural decisions and organize the workflow around AI doing the actual coding.The way I currently do this is that I wrote a small python file that I can start with    llmcode.py /path/to/repo

Which then offers a simple web interface at localhost:8080 where I can select the files to serialize and describe a task.It then creates a prompt like this:    Look at the code files below and do the following:

    {task_description}

    Output all files that you need to change in full again,
    including your changes. In the same format as I provide
    the files below, that means each file starts with
    filename: and ends with :filename
    Under no circumstances output any other text, no additional
    infos, no code formatting chars. Only the code in the
    given format.

    Here are the files:

    somefile.py:
    ...code of somefile.py...
    :somefile.py

    someotherfile.py:
    ...code of someotherfile.py...
    :someotherfile.py

    assets/css/somestyles.css:
    ...code of somestyles.css...
    :assets/css/somestyles.css

    etc

Then llmcode.py sends it to an LLM, parses the output and writes the files back to disk.I then look at the changes via "git diff".It's quite fascinating. I often only make minor changes before accepting the "pull request" the llm made. Sometimes I have to make no changes at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added some benchmarking to show how fast it is:Here is a benchmark comparing it to [Repomix][1] serializing the Next.js project:      time yek
      Executed in    5.19 secs    fish           external
         usr time    2.85 secs   54.00 micros    2.85 secs
         sys time    6.31 secs  629.00 micros    6.31 secs



      time repomix
      Executed in   22.24 mins    fish           external

         sys time    0.23 mins    1.72 millis    0.23 mins

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and limitations of using WebAssembly (Wasm) with garbage collection (GC) for real-time graphics applications. It argues that while Wasm provides significant performance benefits, the current state of Wasm GC is not mature enough to handle the demands of real-time graphics efficiently. The author highlights issues such as latency, performance overhead, and the inconsistency of GC behavior that could hinder the development of interactive applications. Additionally, the piece emphasizes the importance of understanding these limitations for developers considering Wasm for graphics-intensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Does progress for WASM GC mean progress for DOM access as well?Every time I check back on that the initiative seems to run under a different name. What is the best way to track progress on that front?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really liked NaCl (and PNaCl) idea, which allows running arbitrary code, sanitized, with ~90% speed of native execution. Playing Bastion game in browser was refreshing. Unfortunately communication with js code and bootstrap issues (can't run code without plugin, no one except chrome supported this) ruined that tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750781</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline of the traditional personal computer (PC) and the shift towards more personalized and mobile computing devices. It argues that as technology evolves, the focus should return to enhancing personal user experiences rather than simply upgrading hardware specifications. The author advocates for a more intuitive and user-centric approach to computing, emphasizing the need for devices that better cater to individual needs and lifestyles, rather than conforming to a homogenized standard. The piece encourages embracing innovation that enhances the personal connection users have with their technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convenience kills. I think every sane individual in the world knows the article speaks the truth, and I think everyone wants this to happen. But corporations are not individuals, corps are their own life-form, and even though humans make up the corp, the corp is not human, it is not even inhumane, it is a whole different thing, and the humans that operate it has very little influence on it.So, as far as a corp can understand anything, it can't understand this human article. I don't know if one can write articles that a corp can understand, maybe it cannot understand medium in the same way we can.. It seems to act based on information it sees in "markets" and "consumer behaviour", and we don't yet know how to write an article with those (even if "vote with your money" was once believed to be it, until we discovered that mankind as a whole is not an individual that can make a decision)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I expect these comments to be full of agreement. Corporate behavior in the computer space leaves much to he desired.I will however observe;None of the supplied examples showed any form of network effect. It was all stuff you did at home.Today, there are certainly options for personal computing for most everything- as long as network effects are not in play.Those options may not be as convenient, as cheap, or as feature-rich as the invasive option. That's fair though - you decide what you want to prioritize.Network effects are harder to deal with. To the extent that in order to be in community you need to adopt the software the community has chosen.Not surprisingly, software producers that can build-in network effects, do so. It's excellent from a lock-in point of view.The title of the article is perhaps then ironic. It's trivial to make computing personal. All the tools to do so already exist.The issue is not Personal Computing. It's Community Computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article made me even more sad than I already was. I've just been reading about Bambu Lab (a leading 3d printer manufacturer, who introduced really good 3d printers a couple of years ago and really shook up the entire market) self-destructing itself and burning through all the goodwill accumulated over the years. They are working on closing down access to their printers, apparently with the end goal of locked-down subscription-based access. This is much like the path that HP followed with their printers.I also write this on a Mac, where I'm watching with sadness the formerly great company being run by bean-counters, who worry about profits, not user experience. The Mac is being progressively locked down and many things break in the process. Yes, it is still better than Windows, where apparently the start menu is just advertising space and the desktop isn't mine, but Microsoft's, but the path is definitely sloping down.It's just sad.I don't know what else to write. There isn't much we can do, as long as everybody tolerates this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763095</guid></item><item><title>14.

I sometimes feel Phoenix has become the hammer we sort of use on everything, but maybe there are better ways (e.g. for more content focused websites).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m getting a weird issue with scrolling on this page: https://hologram.page/docs/quick-start (iOS safari)I seem to only be able to scroll once, then it freezes. Tapping the URL bar kinda resets it and lets me scroll again, but then it freezes again.It looks like a static page so I’m not sure what would be causing that, but a total guess would be re-renders on the code blocks? Not sure if that makes sense though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710376</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a tiny certificate authority (CA) using a Raspberry Pi and a YubiKey for enhanced security. It explains the benefits of having a personal CA, such as managing certificates for devices and services securely. The guide walks readers through the necessary hardware and software requirements, installation procedures, and configuration steps, ensuring users can create a self-hosted CA that leverages the strong authentication capabilities of the YubiKey. Additionally, it covers potential use cases and considerations for users interested in implementing their own certificate infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This being raspberry pi absolves you from needing to buy a separate hardware noise generator: it has plenty of GPIO. For example, one can obtain entropy by sampling random noise generated by reverse-biasing a junction in a cheap pn transistor. Here is an example: http://holdenc.altervista.org/avalanche/. Bonus — maybe it will get you hooked on electrical engineering!Btw, some versions of raspberry pi already have hardware random number number generator accessible at 
/dev/hwrng.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"with a Yubikey" is probably a better title. The yubikey thingy costs more than the PI (and there is a helpful link if you want to buy one).Very little of this has to do with a PI, it seems like almost any kind of home server would work (especially linux). And it is unclear to me what value is added by the yubikey? And would any FIDO device work, or is this yubikey brand only?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm running smallstep CA in my homelab. While it's nicely done and clearly focuses to the containerized enterprise market, its defaults are very harsh.Take for example the maximum certificate duration. While from a production/security perspective short-lived certificates are great, you don't want to renew certs in your homelab every 24-48hrs. Also, many things just don't support ACME but still benefit from a valid certificate, e.g. router/firewall/appliance web interfaces. Out of the box, the limit for traditionally issued certificates using the CLI is very low, too.The default prevents expired certificates to be renewed. If your homelab does not offer a couple of nines behind the comma, you'll pretty much have to intervene on a regular basis UNLESS you adjust the defaults. You can't set the max duration to years, months or days but only hours:  "claims": {
     "minTLSCertDuration": "24h",
     "maxTLSCertDuration": "26400h",
     "defaultTLSCertDuration": "9000h"
    },

If the goal of hour homelab is to design/test/experiment with a fault-tolerant high availability k8s infra, e.g. for your job, it's great.CAVE: macOS enforces duration limits even for trusted enterprise CAs, e.g. Safari won't accept your 1000 days certificate anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758070</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how to convert a UTC date-time string into a Unix epoch timestamp, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970. It details various methods of performing this conversion using programming languages and tools, such as Python, JavaScript, and command-line utilities. The author provides examples and code snippets to illustrate each method, ensuring ease of understanding for readers looking to manipulate date and time formats in their applications. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of time zone awareness when working with date-time conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it a struggle though?They needed to have a locale matching the language of the localised time string they wanted to parse, they needed to use strptime to parse the string, they needed to use timegm() to convert the result to seconds when seen as UTC. The man pages pretty much describe these things.The interface or these things could certainly be nicer, but most of the things they bring up as issues aren't even relevant for the task they're trying to do. Why do they talk about daylight savings time being confusing when they're only trying to deal with UTC which doesn't have it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My personal rule for time processing: use the language-provided libraries for ONLY 2 operations: converting back and forth between a formatted time string with a time zone, and a Unix epoch timestamp. Perform all other time processing in your own code based on those 2 operations, and whenever you start with a new language or framework, just learn those 2.I've wasted so many dreary hours trying to figure out crappy time processing APIs and libraries. Never again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13 more years to go until the 2038 problem.Surely we'll have everything patched up by then..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758257</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an investigation into a peculiar out-of-memory (OOM) error encountered while using the Rust programming language. It outlines the author's experience with debugging the issue, emphasizing the importance of understanding the Rust ownership model and memory management. The piece highlights various techniques for diagnosing memory problems, such as utilizing tools like Valgrind and Rust’s built-in features. Ultimately, it serves as a guide for Rust developers facing similar memory-related challenges, providing insights into best practices for efficient memory usage and error resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis looks rather half-finished. They did not analyze why so much memory was consumed. If this is the cache which persists after the first call, if it's temporary working memory, or if it's an accumulating memory leak. And why it uses so much memory at all.I couldn't find any other complaints about rust backtrace printing consuming a lot of memory, which I would have expected if this was normal behaviour. So I wonder if there is anything special about their environment or usecase?I would assume that the same OOM problem would arise when printing a panic backtrace. Either their instance has enough memory to print backtraces, or it doesn't. So I don't understand why they only disable lib backtraces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the article they talk about how printing an error from the anyhow crate in debug format creates a full backtrace, which leads to an OOM error. This happens even with 4 GB of memory.Why does creating a backtrace need such a large amount of memory? Is there a memory leak involved as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can't they print something that llvm-symbolizer would pick up offline?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708904</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of safeguarding the protocols that underpin Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform developed by Twitter's co-founder. It discusses the potential risks associated with centralized control over social media networks and argues for the necessity of maintaining open protocols to ensure user autonomy, privacy, and freedom of expression. The piece highlights the broader implications of protocol governance on digital culture and communication, advocating for collaborative efforts to strengthen and protect these foundational technologies against monopolistic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't tell why the writers feel that Bluesky's AT protocol is somehow the technologically best, or most politically strategic foundation, for a viable open mechanism for this kind of communication.This article does seem to have the effect of being an endorsement of Bluesky, though.(What I mean by endorsement: "Why would this progressive political operator be saying that we need to focus on freedom safeguards for this Bluesky platform, if it wasn't obviously the place for progressives to be.  And no mention of anything else, like W3C standard ActivityPub, so that's right out.  Clearly we must once again get behind a platform that someone owns.  And then work from a position of weakness, like activists.  Since that went so well for the co-author's former MoveOn.org, as evidenced by the incoming administration.  And we can keep telling people they are under attack, and keep raising donations from them, to continue the fight.")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The internet doesn’t need to be like this. As luck would have it, a new way is emerging just in time.  If you’ve heard of Bluesky...Why do they write as if activitypub and mastodon do not exist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky is two completely separate things:1) A Twitter clone without the political baggage and chaos of the current Twitter ownership.2) A vastly overengineered distributed software system with a strong ideological commitment to federated design.There's no inherent relationship between the two, but a lot of the people who run 1 are heavily committed to 2, and so end up sowing a lot of confusion about it.I would wager that most Bluesky users don't care about it being decentralized, and in fact want a lot of features (soft block, private blocklists) that the federated design makes impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752703</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the humorous analogy between Git's autocorrect feature and the high-speed world of Formula One racing. It highlights how Git's rapid corrections can sometimes overwhelm users, much like the lightning-fast pace that drivers endure on the racetrack. The author elaborates on common Git commands that users might mistype and how the autocorrect feature attempts to correct these errors quickly, drawing a parallel to a pit crew's efficiency during a race. Ultimately, the piece demonstrates the balance between speed and accuracy in both technology and motorsport.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For reference, Valtteri Bottas supposedly recorded a 40ms!!! reaction time at the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix.https://www.formula1.com/en/video/valtteri-bottas-flying-fin...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Originally, if you typed an unknown command, it would just say "this is not a git command".Back in the 70s, Hal Finney was writing a BASIC interpreter to fit in 2K of ROM on the Mattel Intellivision system. This meant every byte was precious. To report a syntax error, he shortened the message for all errors to:    EH?

I still laugh about that. He was quite proud of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The root cause here is poorly named settings.If the original setting had been named something bool-y like `help.autocorrect_enabled`, then the request to accept an int (deciseconds) would've made no sense. Another setting `help.autocorrect_accept_after_dsec` would've been required. And `dsec` is so oddball that anyone who uses it would've had to look up.I insist on this all the time in code reviews. Variables must have units in their names if there's any ambiguity. For example, `int timeout` becomes `int timeout_msec`.This is 100x more important when naming settings, because they're part of your public interface and you can't ever change them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760620</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Divers recently recovered an ancient shipwreck that sank approximately 2,600 years ago off the coast of Spain, revealing artifacts that provide insights into maritime trade during the time of the Phoenicians. The ship, which is believed to have been involved in commerce, contained various items such as ceramics and metal objects. This discovery adds to the understanding of ancient cultures and their interactions through trade in the Mediterranean. The site is an important archaeological find that emphasizes the significance of underwater exploration in uncovering historical narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it’s one-way, it’s just a “mo”. The “dem” part will only be on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to bear in mind, if anyone feels like trying out this old stuff, is that modems relied on the latency being absolutely fixed; as was guaranteed in the POTS network - and of course an analogue connection. Modern VoIP calling does not guarantee this at all, and even if you have a landline it will almost certainly  have been converted to run on VoIP by now. There were compatibility fixes (such as V.150.1)  but given the limited usage it would not be  surprising if they have bitrotted at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is brilliant and elegant. It's quite satisfying to have ways to have older computers communicate with the rest of the world.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proliferation of charity and community bookshops is substantially the product of tax policy. Commercial property is taxed at ~50% of the nominal rental value, but charities are substantially or wholly exempt from this tax. Importantly, this tax is owed regardless of whether the property is occupied; for a commercial landlord, it is therefore preferable to lease a unit to a charity at a peppercorn rent if the unit is expected to remain vacant for some time. This has had a profound effect on the makeup of retail tenants, particularly in small towns with high vacancy rates, which some argue amounts to a harmful market distortion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be honest, I prefer charity shops to professional shops for 2nd hand books.That said, I still visit professional shops rather more than I should (it depends on the shop.)Of course charity shops are cheaper, that's part of the appeal, but I have more success in them because they are less discerning.Over the years I've acquired a LOT of books, so now I tend to limit myself more. Mostly I now collect science fiction, with an emphasis on work pre 1970. These were made cheap, and are usually in "poor" condition now.Professional shops won't shelve them, whereas charity shops will, so I have more success there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A.Z. Fell has a decent bookshop but when I called recently they said: "Fell's Bookshop. We probably don't have what you're looking for and we wouldn't sell it to you if we did."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712341</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it's used in industry sometimes, ROS is really one of those by-and-for-academia tools. There's a reason it's near-universally reviled, and why "migrate off of ROS" is a standing goal at a lot of robotics companies.There's also a reason why it's a standing goal, rather than a completed goal.It does little or nothing really well, but it does everything kind of okay.There's a lot of "alternatives", most of which do something much better, sometimes much much much better, than ROS, but none of which can replace it all completely. PyRobot, Viam, OROCOS, Webots, all of these do some things much better than ROS, but none of them can drop in and easily replace everything without a lot of developer time, often adding new features to the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to use ROS2 twice in my professional career. Both times ended up with massively bloated build pipeline code, significantly longer build times, and massively bloated Docker images.Don't use ROS2. The benefits just aren't worth it. It's great for school but it's terrible for production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ROS project has terrible governance, and the community suffers heavily from groupthink.I just got banned from their forum for questioning what the ROS Foundation has done in the past two years--specifically on the build system. Yes, their middleware is unforgiving of alternative ways other than their wrong and outdated development practices, but their community is more religiously attached to their precious tools for development.This is the post I wrote:

What if anything can we learn from this to understand the jury system and prosecutorial process?Also, I have watched a bunch of series and I have not once noticed anyone click the obvious “hack”: the last person to enter the breakfast room after a kill night is almost always a faithful, because of the TV cliffhanger of viewers hanging on which of two faithful survived. It’s the best truth signal the game gives and I’ve never seen a player mention it. Maybe TV edits the knowledge out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This game (under the "Mafia" name) has been popular in Finnish math-contest circles since some time in the 1990s, probably as a Russian import. In large groups there can be many more roles, such as the axe-wielding lone killer, the police chief who gets reliable information from the game master, and the doctor who can rescue a victim if they guess correctly. Lots of fun.Someone mentioned Blood on the Clocktower &lt;https://bloodontheclocktower.com/&gt; which has many more roles and a more complicated game that can take hours. The upside is that you aren't out of the game when you are eliminated.In the other direction, there is a One Night Ultimate Werewolf ruleset &lt;https://www.wargamer.com/one-night-ultimate-werewolf/review&gt; that leads to a much faster game because it's not iterated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42755251</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“… we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training”Ha ha ha. Even written agreements are routinely violated as long as the potential upside &gt; downside, and all you have is verbal agreement? And you didn’t disclose this?At the time o3 was released I wrote “this is so impressive that it brings out the pessimist in me”[0], thinking perhaps they were routing API calls to human workers.Now we see in reality I should’ve been more cynical, as they had access to the benchmark data but verbally agreed (wink wink) not to train on it.[0: https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=agnosticmantis#42476... ]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A co-founder of Epoch left a note in the comments:&gt; We acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions, with the exception of a unseen-by-OpenAI hold-out set that enables us to independently verify model capabilities. However, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training.Ouch. A verbal agreement. As the saying goes, those aren't worth the paper they're written on, and that's doubly true when you're dealing with someone with a reputation like Altman's.And aside from the obvious flaw in it being a verbal agreement, there are many ways in which OpenAI could technically comply with this agreement while still gaining a massive unfair advantage on the benchmarks to the point of rendering them meaningless. For just one example, knowing the benchmark questions can help you select training data that is tailored to excelling at the benchmarks without technically including the actual question in the training data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do people actually think OpenAI is gaming benchmarks?I know they have lost trust and credibility, especially on HN. But this is a company with a giant revenue opportunity to sell products that work.What works for enterprise is very different from “does it beat this benchmark”.No matter how nefarious you think sama is, everything points to “build intelligence as rapidly as possible” rather than “spin our wheels messing with benchmarks”.In fact, even if they did fully lie and game the benchmark - do you even care? As an OpenAI customer, all I care about is that the product works.I code with o1 for hours every day, so I am very excited for o3 to be released via API. And if they trained on private datasets, I honestly don’t care. I just want to get a better coding partner until I’m irrelevant.Final thought - why are these contractors owed a right to know where funding came from? I would definitely be proud to know I contributed to the advancement of the field of AI if I was included in this group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763231</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a case study exploring the design process and conceptual framework behind the project "Under Whose Command," which examines themes of power, authority, and identity in contemporary society. It highlights the collaborative approach taken by the design team, the methodologies used, and the significance of the resulting work in fostering dialogue about the implications of command and control within various contexts. The study emphasizes the interplay between design, narrative, and audience engagement, showcasing how the project aims to provoke thought and reflection on the structures of leadership and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go into detail on their technical decision making, very cool:Choosing Clojure6 and Datalog7 was a calculated risk–but one which paid off. The Datalog model offered the simplest and most ergonomic queries, had strengths in graphs and relationships, and the entity model could easily transform to more standard formats. In–memory Datomic was chosen on the server, allowing complicated relational rule–based queries to map over tens of thousands of claims, linking sources to the attributes of entities. Using Clojure allowed for rapid prototyping and fast feedback cycles. Together, this allowed constructing arbitrary graph traversal queries, without having to round–trip from the database to execute recursive code, allowing the nature of traversing the domain model to be separated from the specifics of the relationship. How entities relate, and how relations work through time, could be developed as separate concepts. Using Datalog queries, it was possible to get every subordinate, as well as the time ranges they held true for, with a simple query like (subordinate-of ?a ?b ?start-date ?end-date)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting and I think important. Something that should be done for any Armee even.I found the writing style … interesting. The author assumed we the reader would have a specific understanding how to model this data. And that they cracked the code. Well that military posts, commands and in some cases government loyalty can change is known. Maybe I read too much into it this morning :). I dislike being treated as ignorant that’s all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a reason Russian forces are wearing face-covers in Ukraine. That anonymity even became integral part of the official propaganda with the country plastered with images with covered faces like this https://ok.ru/group/53906516017252/album/922573735012/931001...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42723464</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of how heat typically disrupts order in physical systems, leading to increased entropy and disorder. However, it highlights a special case where certain systems can maintain some level of order despite rising temperatures. The piece explores the underlying principles of this remarkable behavior, examining how specific interactions or structures in materials enable them to retain some degree of organization even in hotter conditions. This counterintuitive result has implications for understanding phase transitions, material science, and potentially for the development of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now if only I could purchase one**I realize enterprise “GPUs” are difficult to purchase as an individual whether they’re AMD or Nvidia, but AMD might be well-served to mimic their RX 480 strategy (“make a competitive mid-range GPU, distribute it through several board partners, and sell it at rock-bottom prices to get it to as many customers as possible”). If there’s a compelling reason to use AMD hardware over Nvidia, the software support will come. As an extreme example, if one could purchase an MI300X for $50 a pop, surely FAANG and others would invest time and effort into the software side to leverage the cost savings vs Nvidia, who is unquestionably price-gouging due to their monopolistic hold on the enterprise GPU market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those are some sketchy bar charts. If the bar doesn't start at y=0 and you don't even have axis ticks, it's meaningless and just a colorful blob on your slide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our team has access to multiple systems that either have MI250Xs or H100s. Getting stuff to work with AMD/ROCm is substantially more effort than the NVIDIA/CUDA experience.Some of this is lack of groundwork/engineering by packages or system administrators, but it seems a decent amount is the relative lack of effort by AMD to make things work well OOTB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42718656</guid></item><item><title>32.

Real people publishing real stuff.Last year X started occasionally showing some random content like Reddit, I'd mark them as "not interesting" and move on.Since last month there's no tech content by tech people, there's exclusively junk worse than on Reddit's homepage. No amount of "not interesting" will fix it. Oh, there's porn now too.I stopped opening X altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me the worst part is not even the feed (I can use “following” tab) but the replies. I often used to look at single threads to see replies there. Since they started prioritizing replies from premium users it turned into cesspool and I eventually stopped using X altogether&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use X to mostly follow politics and some math/physics, and the political feed in the "For you" tab is remarkably balanced. I actually maintain two separate lists called "Left" and "Right" that I slot accounts into, and I just go to each list's feed to see what each side is saying about something. The "For you" tab has a mix, and overall has been pretty well balanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42755173</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed explanation of indentation in Lisp programming, discussing its importance for readability and code structure. It outlines various indentation styles and conventions used in Lisp, including specific examples for different scenarios. Additionally, it covers how to apply these conventions in practice, helping developers write cleaner and more maintainable Lisp code by adhering to established formatting guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

        (define (ok? datum)
            (every 
                (lambda (restriction)
                    (restriction datum)
                )
                restrictions
            )
        )
        (define (element-match data dictionary succeed)
            (and 
                (ok? data)
                (let ((vcell (match:lookup variable dictionary)))
                    (if vcell
                        (and 
                            (equal? (match:value vcell) data)
                            (succeed dictionary)
                        )
                        (succeed (match:bind variable data dictionary))
                    )
                )
            )
        )
        element-match
    )

It may not be densest or most compact indentation scheme, but damn is it readable for someone without a lisp/scheme background!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any formatters that detect related things and put them in the same column? Here's a Pie example:  (claim  Tuple3 (-&gt;                U       U     U    U))

&lt;p&gt;The article by Paul Graham reflects on Twitter's impact and its significance as a communication platform. It discusses the unique aspects of Twitter, such as its brevity and real-time engagement, which invite diverse conversations and ideas. Graham explores the platform's advantages for users, like fostering creativity and enabling rapid access to information. He also considers the potential downsides of Twitter, including the spread of misinformation and the nature of online discourse. Ultimately, the piece presents Twitter as a powerful tool that shapes contemporary communication while acknowledging its complexities and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PG was/is completely wrong. Twitter was supposed to be the new SMS, or text message protocol, but that never happened. RSS is an example of a protocol in that space. At best, Twitter was/is an API.In a practical utility perspective Twitter was a pub/sub broadcast system in the social media space. It was slim, fast, and real time in a way the Facebook wasn’t, due to a 140 character limit. Yet, it never seemed to become more than 10% of Facebook and almost exclusively used only by people who were already heavy Facebook users.I remember the optimism around Twitter in 2007 because it was immediately evident that it was addictive to certain personalities. Some people just had to broadcast absolutely everything they did, often irrationally. Most everyone else tried to find a use for Twitter but couldn’t. I know many early users that either abandoned or deleted their accounts before 2010.Eventually it just became a text broadcast interface via their client. That is good for people who want to build a following, but nobody else found a use for it. In that regard YouTube is the Twitter replacement but YouTube had value otherwise that Twitter never could.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Paul Graham fella seems to be a trumpet of bad ideas.
His hype-takes on tech influence laypeoples notions of the world.
His failure to clarify how tech functions is misleading.Techne is the Greek word for hand.
Xitter is a megaphone owned by and fully utilized by a misanthropic bully.
In no way shape or form is it a voice of the people. 
It is weighted multicast media with owners and nobility and a feed and an algorithm for prioritizing the owner and the nobility in the feed.A protocol? Ha! We knew it wasn't a protocol or layer for anything before the so-called Arab Spring.How many bad ideas has Paul Graham defended?Despite the continuing proliferation of crypto-currency pyramid schemes, and their continuing ability to fool investors, they are a net negative for a planet in the throes of a climate meltdown.Despite the reverent tones of baffled journalists speaking of LLMs as AI, despite the tech CEOs claiming that developers will be replaced tomorrow, anyone who knows anything about LLMs rolls their eyes, amd yet Paul will reliably write apologies for yet another destructive wave of investments in lousy scamware companies.The king of bad ideas, chewed into bite size pieces for the masses.What do i know, I'm obviously very unhip in this sort of fabricated false world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In early 2000-2007 I felt technology optimism (things like Digg, slashdot) about new websites and there was a hopefulness about new technology (file sharing) The spirit of new technology that "there is something new" and the "this is how things work from now on" (WAP websites, floppy disks, guest books, simple 1megabyte web hosting, geocities, fan sites, myspace, WhatsApp on cheap phones).In other words, every new thing was something that may have been before but it was "this is how things work from now on". The platform defines and upholds the character of interaction. Twitter and Reddit do that and as pg highlights how twitter recipients is by algorithm. (From OP: "where you don't specify the recipients.")I have fond memories of writing HTML from magazines and in the eras before me it was handwriting text games into BASIC interpreters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760054</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m glad they actually tried synthesizing one of the materials their model predicted. Looks like they succeeded in synthesizing only 1 out of 4 of the materials for which they tried. The 20% accurate property claim appears to be for bulk modulus. I’m still seeing little value for this technology for designing electronic properties, mainly because density functional theory which provides the training data is not reliable. Their code looks nice and clean and well organized, perhaps I’ll give it a try.My biggest problem with this application of AI is trying to approximate DFT, which itself is an unreliable approximation. The claim is it lets you amortize the expensive DFT to search the space, but it’s also true that especially for inorganic materials, training sets do not appear to promote strong generalization. So you embark on an expensive task to wind up back with unreliable DFT. I think perhaps the best goal would be to try to make DFT itself better, and I have seen impressive albeit computationally expensive approaches, e.g. FermiNet by DeepMind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42727329</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, Linux network programming, especially socket programming, isn’t that difficult. However, learning this topic on your own can be challenging because many online resources are unclear, and sample codes often only cover the basics. You might find yourself unsure of what to do next. That's why I created this tutorial. It aims to give you clear guidelines and plenty of examples to help you understand better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a guide about Linux Cgroups programming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know - Is there a guide like this that does this with Python instead of the C Socket API?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756365</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The content discusses the features and functionalities of the Mastodon social media platform, highlighting its decentralized nature and user-friendly interface. It emphasizes the importance of community interactions and privacy, as well as the platform's appeal to users seeking an alternative to traditional social media giants. The article also touches on the challenges of moderation and the cultural aspects of utilizing a federated network for social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a shame it had to come to this but I can see why Element had to make this choice.To me it feels like they've ended up in a position similar to Docker Inc. where they've spent years of work and tons of resources building the standards and reference implementations, but missed out on the juicy integration and support contracts.Docker has turned into the OCI standard and most Kubernetes deployment don't even run containerd anymore. The company has massively rate limited Docker hub and recently increased the pricing again, which has had much bigger impact for end users than this pivot by Element.I really hope this works out as a funding source for future Matrix development, I don't see how its ecosystem can continue to be developed and healthy without Element.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find this comment interesting: https://mastodon.matrix.org/@element/113848890455666110 where IMO it is stated that Deutsche Telekom (with HessenConnect 2.0) did the free-riding and "directly contributed to layoffs at Element in 2022 and 2023". It sounds as if Telekom changed its mind after an initial contract or something. Or was Telekom one of many companies that did a similar thing?I know from my own experience that making money based on an open source project is extremely challenging.However, I don't understand why they frame their Pro version in this way and point to failure instead of success. I can't think of a better way (they will have to do the work :)). But it's already a good thing if they've won them as "Matrix believers", and they shouldn't scare them to get there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, the money has to come from somewhere. There's only a handful of companies that make the open source profit game work and last I checked, most of them make their money from B2B deals with support, SLAs, etc. If you want to deploy something at nation scale, surely you can afford to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752402</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like how the author didn’t try to be overly clever with it. They could’ve used Docker to install and isolate dependencies, Caddy or Traefik to serve the site and manage SSL automatically, maybe even k3s to run a mini cluster for HA, Tailscale to avoid manual port forwarding, Terraform for future auto-provisioning without hassle, or Ansible to prepare the machine and all that jazz.Instead, they took the simplest possible route that works: installing the web server on bare metal, serving plain HTML and CSS, and using direct port forwarding via the router. This was a delightful read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had set one (Pi 3B+)up to do both a website as well as a  public service announcement slideshow display for a local Community TV.  Used PHP/CMSimple for the site and wrote a custom slider.Things I learned:- set the pi to reboot on poweroff- Given this was TV used the AV output on the PI displaying in NTSC 4:3 (to support customers with older TVs), so had to be aware of overscan margins- Added a startup script to start chromium in kiosk mode and open the slider page for the show side.  worked 95% of the time, if not just power off then on.- part of the troubleshooting was just unplug and replug - but SD cards will choke on too many power cycles, so instead of SD use a USB-&gt;SATA cable and a regular spinning rust HDD - slower but VERY reliable, the journaling file system can recover after power-outage.- Get the right USB-&gt;SATA cable, USB-3 models seem to be more responsive and the PI can boot from them, there are some are too slow and the Pi will fail to boot.- Slider had it's own login page (outside of CMSimple) to remotely manage the slideshow.- Also changed the SSH Port to something uncommon to thwart bad guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Step 5: Getting an HTTPS CertificateIf you’re using Apache2 you might also want to look at mod_md, not just certbot: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_md.htmlAlso, if you want to minimize the amount of JS, then just drop jQuery and use fetch, it’s reasonably pleasant too: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_APILovely article!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42712378</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article critiques the trend of forcing dark mode across applications and websites, arguing that it should be a user choice rather than a default setting. The author explains how dark mode can negatively impact visibility and usability for some users, particularly in certain lighting conditions and for those with visual impairments. They emphasize the importance of providing options that cater to individual preferences and promoting user control over their own experience. The piece also highlights the potential downsides of dark mode, including reduced readability and distractions in certain contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark mode was the traditional normal.From early green or amber text on black mono displays.
Grey on black DOS text mode.
Light Blue on Dark Blue C-64.
Apple 2's grey/white (I don't recall) on black.
Even GUI wise, Amiga used a dark-blue background as the default Workbench, with user selectable palettes for everything.It was Microsoft Windows that changed the paradigm to default to a searing white display with black text in most apps, like Notepad, Word, etc., because "it's more like paper".  Sure, paper is white, but it's not glowing white.  That transition was painful.I'm glad to see dark-modes return, I agree there needs to be an option, not just forced dark-mode.  Preferably light mode options to use a not-as-bright-as-possible white too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well hang on a sec. If a website is dark with light text and has just that one style, then that's it's theme, it's vibe. Dark mode only exists if there is a light mode, and give versa.Don't force having to maintain two modes on websites who don't want to?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree with this. Default, unconfigurable light mode has been around for a while, and infrastructure like the Dark Reader plugin is around to address this. There is no such thing for light mode, though.In my opinion, light mode is better than dark mode in most situations. The only situation dark mode is better than light mode is when you're sitting in a dark room with your screen as your only light source, and most of the time that's not really a healthy situation to be in. Dark mode is a crutch. Turn on a light or go to sleep.Light mode might be annoying to read in no-light environments, but dark mode is nigh impossible to read in high-light environments. Ever try to read a dark mode UI on your phone on a bright summer's day? Can't read a thing, even with brightness cranked all the way up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762054</guid></item><item><title>44.

Coming from a point of ignorance here: I lucked into some higher and DLAs (though not 5v compatible so they wouldn't directly help here) and their softwares allow both decode and measurements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reliability of this e-shifter in the X3 and S3 has been argued as the cause of the failure and eventual bankruptcy of VanMoofI always wondered what exactly the problem e-shifters were trying to solve was. Is it the "ugliness" of shifting cables? Route them through the frame...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710953</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has decided to remove the iconic TrackPoint nub from its latest ThinkPad laptops, a feature that has been a defining characteristic of the series for decades. This change has sparked disappointment among long-time ThinkPad users, who valued the TrackPoint for its precision and convenience. While Lenovo aims to modernize its designs and features, many loyal customers express concern that the removal of the TrackPoint may detract from the usability and appeal of the new models. The article discusses the implications of this decision for Lenovo's brand identity and its user base.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind of a weirdly written article. Only one model removed the nub, and it's from one of its "we're trying to be MacBook" lines (the X line, like the Z line, are more about form than function). And all that tech shipped in its other lines for a while, afaik.I recently sold a Z13 because it had so many quirks (low battery life due to OLED, trackpad and trackpoint were crap, bluetooth barely worked through the dense metal chassis, display didn't fold down 180 degrees, felt heavy af).I got a T14s instead. Holy crap, it is so much better. Feels lighter, the touchpad and trackpoint are great, 500nits low-energy display is "ok" but battery can last all day. I use the trackpoint all the time (partly due to the touchpad drifting for some reason, and partly just to have a more precise pointer for fine work). The only downside is the lack of more USB-C ports.A random upside if you order it with Ubuntu: it comes with Secure Boot set up correctly. But then a downside: Linux kernel prevents hibernate from working if Secure Boot is enabled, unless you set up an encrypted swap and jump through hoops to set up the bootloader right (and of course it's not set up on Ubuntu). I can't believe it's still such a pain to get otherwise-standard laptop functionality with Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Does that mean the TrackPoint is dead? No, thankfully. It will still appear in the other ThinkPads made by Lenovo, said a company spokesman.This is not about the death of the nub, but about how far the Thinkpad brand name can be diluted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real tragedy is the omission of top TrackPad buttons.Middle-click paste is widely used in Linux, and while I tried mouse emulators with limited success, it sure is good to have a physical button at your thumb.  With a tiling window manager, you can copy (by visual select depending on the application) and paste (middle-click) without ever leaving your home row across multiple windows.  This is a serious work flow tool in REPL.Moreover the new haptic feedback they got on button-less TrackPads have motors etc which are not as reliable as million-click-tested ThinkPads' physical buttons.Laptops are the tools of our trade, and unfortunately, we cannot make too many compromises, especially for the sake of trendy aesthetics.  If ThinkPads want to be MacBooks, then we might as well buy MacBooks; indeed, many of us already do. Almost a decade ago, Lenovo already made a similar mistake with 2nd generation Carbon X1 (and some T series) and they had to revert back. Having a diversity in the market place is important, and I surely hope Lenovo keeps ThinkPads as uniquely performant as they have been since the IBM days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758570</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have multiple degrees in philosophy and I have no idea what this article is even trying to say.If anyone has access to the full article, I’m interested, but it sounds like a lot of buzzwords and not a ton of substance.The framing of ai through a philosophical lens is obviously interesting, but a lot of the problems addressed in the intro are pretty much irrelevant to the ai-ness of the information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; what counts as knowledge (epistemology), and how AI represents reality (ontology) also shape value creation.As a skeptic with only a few drums to beat, my quasi-philosophical complaint about LLMs: we have a rampant problem where humans confuse a character they perceive out of a text-document with a real-world author.In all these hyped-products, you are actually being given the "and then Mr. Robot said" lines from a kind of theater-script. This document grows as your contribution is inserted as "Mr. User says",  plus whatever the LLM author calculates "fits next."So all these excited articles about how SomethingAI has learned deceit or self-interest? Nah, they're really probing how well it assembles text (learned from ones we make) where we humans can perceive a fictional character which exhibits those qualities. That can including qualities we absolutely know the real-world LLM does not have.It's extremely impressive compared to where we used to be, but not the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philosophy eats AI because we're in the exploration phase of the s-curve and there's a whole bunch of VC money pumping into the space. When we switch to an extraction regime, we can expect a lot of these conversations to evaporate and replaced with, "what makes us the most money" regardless of philosophic implication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42760210</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Open Dylan is a collaborative initiative aimed at the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive, openly accessible resource for the works of musician Bob Dylan. The site features a diverse collection of his lyrics, songs, and recordings, along with critical analyses and tools for studying Dylan's music. It serves both as a scholarly archive for researchers and a fan-driven platform, promoting the understanding and appreciation of Dylan’s artistic contributions through community engagement and open-source principles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m curious - what is Dylan really for? Who should use it, and in what situations? I totally could have missed something obvious, but I read through the intro and the ‘Tour’, and it has a lot of detail about what the language is, but not much on when and where to use it. The closest thing seems to be it’s LISP but faster? What are the reasons to choose Dylan over C++, Swift, JavaScript, or Python?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll say this because it's possible to go from my username to name anyway: I share a name with this language. And usually that's fine because it's not very widely used. But seeing this headline was certainly a surprise on an otherwise calm Sunday morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember Apple giving away Dylan CDs when Java was first released.
I learned them both and went with Java.
But I should have taken the opportunity to also learn the Common Lisp Object System.These days we like to bitch about OOP languages, but we could have had better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42756896</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OK, these are a LOT of fun to play with. I've been trying out a quantized version of the Llama 3 one from here: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-...The one I'm running is the 8.54GB file. I'm using Ollama like this:    ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0

You can prompt it directly there, but I'm using my LLM tool and the llm-ollama plugin to run and log prompts against it. Once Ollama has loaded the model (from the above command) you can try those with uvx like this:    uvx --with llm-ollama \
      llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \
      'a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together'

Here's what I got - the joke itself is rubbish but the "thinking" section is fascinating: https://gist.github.com/simonw/f505ce733a435c8fc8fdf3448e381...I also set an alias for the model like this:    llm aliases set r1l 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' 

Now I can run "llm -m r1l" (for R1 Llama) instead.I wrote up my experiments so far on my blog: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.We've been running qualitative experiments on OpenAI o1 and QwQ-32B-Preview [1]. In those experiments, I'd say there were two primary things going against QwQ. First, QwQ went into endless repetitive loops, "thinking out loud" what it said earlier maybe with a minor modification. We had to stop the model when that happened; and I feel that it significantly hurt the user experience.It's great that DeepSeek-R1 fixes that.The other thing was that o1 had access to many more answer / search strategies. For example, if you asked o1 to summarize a long email, it would just summarize the email. QwQ reasoned about why I asked it to summarize the email. Or, on hard math questions, o1 could employ more search strategies than QwQ. I'm curious how DeepSeek-R1 will fare in that regard.Either way, I'm super excited that DeepSeek-R1 comes with an MIT license. This will notably increase how many people can evaluate advanced reasoning models.[1] https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/discussions/2608&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: I am very well aware this is not a valid test or indicative or anything else. I just thought it was hilarious.When I asked the normal "How many 'r' in strawberry" question, it gets the right answer and argues with itself until it convinces itself that its (2). It counts properly, and then says to it self continuously, that can't be right.https://gist.github.com/IAmStoxe/1a1e010649d514a45bb86284b98...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42768072</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reality for most graduates is even grimmer:&gt; • £25,000 starting salaries at traditional engineering firms&gt; • Exodus to consulting or finance just because it's compensated betterThis is _exactly_ my career so far.The key thing about the British economy is that while most things operate in a free market, construction is centrally planned by councillors who are incentivised to block most development. So the whole economy is struggling, but industries that need physical space are especially hard hit. Your local council can't block you from writing more code, but can stop you from building lab space near where people want to live and work.My first job out of uni was in a wonderful small engineering firm in Cambridge. Lab space there is eye-wateringly expensive because it's illegal to build enough, so we were based in a makeshift lab in an attic next to the sewage works. I loved working there, but it shows that we're restricting our small businesses unnecessarily through our planning system.The solution is frustratingly simple, but politically suicidal for any government that tried to implement it: just legalise development subject to basic design codes. I hope we see some planning reform before it's too late for our struggling innovation industries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think it’s just a UK thing, or that it’s much easier to start a hardware startup in the USA.I think it’s more that the bar for getting a hardware startup off the ground is much higher than a software startup - everywhere in the world.Personally I’ve been trying to self-fund and bootstrap a hardware startup (based in Australia but I’m reasonably well connected in Silicon Valley as I’m a YC alum). I’ve had plenty of early success and validation of all my market theses, but it’s super hard to get any investors interested. Plenty say “exciting” and want to chat. All lose interest when you start talking funding needs and path to market.In a world in which investors and other startup industry contacts are accustomed to seeing a bootstrapped SaaS app showing signs of growth and revenue just a few months in, with a hardware startup it’s just impossible to avoid looking like a failure by comparison - due to all the costs, delays and complications involved with getting an MVP to market. And because successful hardware startups are so scarce relative to software ones, it’s hard even to get any good advice; there’s just barely anyone around with good, relevant experience to share (and I already know many of the people who have built companies in this vertical in past decades, none of whom are in SV).I’ve come to the conclusion that the only way to make it work is to start by achieving success as a software startup, then transition into hardware to later - but even then you’d have to convince investors that it’s worth the risk.In short, the whole tech industry has been spoiled by easy SaaS wins over the past decade, and that’s all that most investors are willing to even consider.The exceptions are “start-big and-get-huge-fast” plays like Groq - but the founders of that company were already highly credentialed and connected when they started, and even then vanishingly few investors are willing/able to fund new companies like that. That’s not the kind of thing young, unproven founders can pull off, anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a Brit, when I was raising the seed round for my startup, UK and European VCs would consistently try to haggle you down on price while the American VC's were exclusively focussed on trying to figure out whether this could be a billion dollar business or not (in the end we raised a $5m seed led by Spark, and have done extremely well and raised more since).The UK lost Deep Mind - which could have been OpenAI!! -- to Google. I think part of the issue is cultural - the level of ambition in the UK is just small compared to the US. Individual founders like Demis or Tom Blomfield may have it but recruiting enough talent with the ambition levels of early Palantir or OpenAI employees is so hard because there are so few. Instead, a lot of extremely smart people in the UK would rather get the 'safe' job at Google, or McKinsey than the 'this will never work but can you imagine how cool it would be if it did' job at a startup.There are probably political reasons as well. Unfortunately the UK has not been well governed for 20 years or so, and hence economic outcomes as a whole have been abysmal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763386</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article on reverse engineering Bambu Connect provides a detailed guide on how to analyze and understand the functionality of the Bambu Connect software and hardware. It outlines the steps involved in the reverse engineering process, including tools, methods, and techniques used to examine the code and architecture. The guide also discusses potential applications and implications of the reverse engineering findings for users and developers, highlighting the importance of understanding software interactions, troubleshooting, and enhancing user experience within the Bambu ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I don't get...BambuSlicer is open source. And, not only is it open source, it's a fork of PrussaSlicer, so Bambu doesn't have the ability to re-license it.It's licensed under the Affero GPL which is very strict about the licensing of derived works. That license requires Bambu to include the source code to any additions they make, including all of the logic, keys, etc. that they're baking into any binary distributions. If they don't, they're violating the copyright rights of Prussa and many others.So, either Bambu has to open source all of this, which defeats the purpose (given that it's already leaked, that's gonna happen anyway) or they have to route everything through a separate program for their own slicer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am angry at the bait-and-switch Bambu is pulling. I bought one of their printers in the Black Friday sale on the understanding it was reasonably hackable and open. Now they're trying to lock it down so I can't print on my own printer without using their approved software and DRM chain. It's outrageous.More info on the hacking (the first in what may be a long stupid fight): https://hackaday.com/2025/01/19/bambu-connects-authenticatio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish Prusa weren't asleep at the wheel, then we would have bought a core one (that is, the hypothetical variant with large build volume and same quality as bambulab).Instead, we bought a P1S, which is, technically speaking, a fantastic machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764602</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used mixxx to do the djing for my wedding last year. Created a collaborative music voting site for the guests, then got all the music and made a mix which worked really well, even going between genres.  Had a lot of fun playing with it getting everything ready and it worked with a couple of DJ controllers bought cheaply without any issue.I even made a little program to read the now playing track from the sqlite database which then allowed the lights to follow the music (for complex reasons I don't have time to explain).Most importantly it worked on the night without missing a beat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been using it for the past few years, nothing bad to say about it, lovely piece of software. Vendor lock-in is very present in this field, with different brands of controllers supported by a myriad of proprietary DJ applications all more interested in onboarding you to their music subscription services rather than implement useful features or support open protocols.Meanwhile, Mixxx allows you to write your own adapter scripts for any controller you have (as long as it outputs MIDI), and there's a built-in library featuring scripts for the most common commercial controllers and MIDI devices out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really happy that 2.5 added 'beats until next marker', which together with a USB controller from Numark I have pretty much feature complete DJ setup for under $500 (including cost of laptop &amp; controller) without having to rely on Windows, Mac, subscription licenses or feature-crippled 'lite' versions.And it's surprising how quickly people adapt to it when they're used to other setups, within an hour a few people have gone from 'oooh, can I have a go' to showing me their own tips, tricks and different styles.Especially combined with a youtube &amp; soundcloud downloader running on a different workspace, I can get pretty much any track into the library within a minute or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769871</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of eSIM technology with devices that only have a physical SIM slot by introducing a 9eSIM card, which allows for the integration of eSIM capabilities in devices that traditionally do not support them, such as certain Android and Linux devices. It covers the benefits of eSIMs, including convenience and flexibility in managing mobile connectivity, and provides guidance on how to set up and use the 9eSIM card to enable eSIM functionality in compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the effects of interruptions on work performance and productivity, highlighting research findings that demonstrate how interruptions can lead to increased errors and longer task completion times. It explores the types of interruptions, such as external distractions and multitasking, and offers strategies for managing them, like establishing boundaries, using technology wisely, and creating a focused work environment. The piece emphasizes the importance of minimizing disruptions to enhance overall efficiency and maintain concentration in both personal and professional settings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interruptions are productivity and creativity killers. Middle managers are of questionable utility but that layer of an organization would be much more effective if it focused ruthlessly on removing distractions.I worked at a small company where a significant portion of my effort went toward shielding my team from the distractions created by a CEO who couldn’t seem to help meddling in every aspect of the business. I think it’s because he started out doing, or at least being involved with, many of the functions of the company and had a hard time letting go as we grew. Even after the organization grew to 50+ people he couldn’t keep himself out of the nitty gritty details, but the format of the distraction changed over time. Instead of walking up to people and interrupting them in person (a double whammy according to this study, including both an “important” person and the in-person aspect), he would send what we called “Slack attacks” throughout the day. These were paragraphs-long Slack messages without any semblance of organization, punctuation, or line breaks. Fortunately, many of these messages were sent during the very early hours of the morning so they could be dealt with first thing in the AM, but that wasn’t always the case.In the first phase I literally moved my team location and reorganized the desk arrangement so it was harder for him to get in and bug everyone. I had to “guard” the area and try to stop him from physically entering the space, which was always a strange dance. I couldn’t control his Slack messaging behavior so I worked with people to understand that while yes “the CEO is asking you for urgent work in Slack” seems like a valid reason to switch gears, but instead let me work to figure out what actually needs to be done and we’ll catch up later about what to do.It was a weird dynamic but there was no doubt the distractions were a drag on performance. Every time he went on vacation we saw a marked increase in productivity, and more creative solutions seemed to come up as well. I don’t wish this type of environment on anyone but in a way I’m glad to have gone through it and learned some lessons about interruptions and how to avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;40 or so years later, the book Peopleware by DeMarco and Lister remains the best quantitative study on environmental impacts on developer productivity.The world has changed significantly since it was written, so you have to translate their measurements to modern contexts, but it's easier to translate real data on human behavior than to guess based on guesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Teams is perhaps the worst communication software your company can have for Software Engineers. People usually don't use the half-baked threads capabilities because they're separate and not intuitive, so it's usually just endless chat messages, all at once. And so you get constant pinging all day. And then I need to mute my Teams chats, which is also risky because I could have gotten an important message.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762962</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a personal anecdote of the author's experience of meeting the renowned game developer and creator of the popular character "PG" at a gaming convention. The author reflects on the excitement and nervousness of the encounter, sharing details about the conversation they had and the impact this meeting had on their appreciation for gaming. Overall, it highlights the joy of meeting a personal hero and the memorable moments that come with fandom.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the long run I think realizations like the authors are healthy ones.PG is not a hero. He's just a guy. A guy who entered into business transactions with a number of people, many of whom benefitted greatly (as did Paul himself). I'm not saying any of that as a negative! Just that we have a habit of attributing superhuman characteristics to folks (Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize comes to mind) and ending up disappointed.I'm not an affected group by any means but I still share the disappointment in the world we see today vs the possibilities I felt tech would allow when I was younger. The tech CEOs I previously viewed as visionaries now just look like a new generation of socially regressive robber barons. I wanted to be one of those CEOs, these days I'm still not quite sure what I want to be. My only consolation is knowing that I'm seeing the world more accurately than I once did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great, cohesive, and clear essay! Hear hear.One thing that I think is underappreciated in our current times, that gets lost on both the left and the right sides -- an individual is more important than their identity.- A specific trans person can also be an asshole.- A specific white man can also be a saint.Extremists on both political sides will scream about the reasons one or the other of those statements is wrong, but doing so lumps all possible individuals of an identity into a "them" category to which blanket statements, positive or negative, can be applied.That reductionism feels incredibly insulting to our shared, innate humanity.Are there all kinds of subconscious and societal biases that seriously influence our perceptions of others on the basis of their identity? Sure!But it doesn't change the goal of treating the person standing in front of you, first and foremost and always, as an individual person.Be curious. Be courteous and respectful. Be a normal, nice goddamn human to human across the table from you.(And maybe, if you feel so inclined, have some compassion about what they did to get to that table)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I’m certain he wouldn’t be rude to my face, but he might quietly discriminate against me, say no thanks. He might not even think of it as discrimination, only that I don’t have what it takes."This resonates pretty strongly (and depressingly) with me being an immigrant academic in Europe who came originally from a third-world country. Even though I am one of the most productive researchers in my department, even though I studied in the best university in my country (which is mind-blowingly better than the one I'm currently in), even if I say yes to almost everything, and even if I work easily 150% what an average native colleague does, none of this matter at all. Every morning I wake up there is a new knife on my back. Opportunities just vanish transparently; pressure amounts over pressure amounts pressure; there is always that quiet, mute side look that says (without words) "if you don't like it, why don't you leave?".And what really makes this ten times worse is that the country I'm in has this almost ethereal reputation for begin some kind of paradise where everyone is super polite and calm and rational, so whenever I complain about anything it feels like I'm some kind of spoiled child. Half the time I even convince myself of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767507</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the camera used.[1]It's not exotic. It's a 1936 × 1216 Sony sensor with a C-mount lens.
That's below current phone camera resolution. It's monochrome,
which makes sense in this application.They have bigger collecting optics than a phone, and you get better sensitivity without the color filters.I'm not clear on how they get their "down" reference. It's clear how they get heading; that's easy if you can see the stars. But you need an accurate horizon or vertical to get latitude and longitude.
One degree of error in the vertical is maybe 100 km of error in position. How good are drone AHRS systems today in attitude? They have a correction system that works if you fly in a circle, but that just corrects for constant misalignment between camera and down reference.[1] https://www.alliedvision.com/fileadmin/pdf/en/Alvium_1800_U-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see an explanation of what strapdown meant in this context, so I dug one up:"Traditional, stable-platform navigation systems commonly involve separate accelerators and fibers or laser-based gyroscopes, with all the components mechanically and rigidly mounted on a stable platform that is isolated from the moving vehicle. This leads to the drawbacks of large size, poor reliability, and high cost. In contrast, in strapdown navigation systems, the inertial sensors are fastened directly to the vehicle’s body, which means the sensors rotate together with the vehicle. "https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/11/652&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact:The SR-71 and U2 planes had automated celestial navigation systems b/c GPS wasn't around when they came out.There a story in the book about Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works where they mention turning on the system while one of the planes was in the hangar and it locked on to a hole in the roof (sun was shining through the hole and system thought it was a start).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767797</guid></item><item><title>9.

The one thing that really stood out was how the Flash ROM happened to contain a previous version of the hidden ROM sitting right there.  While it didn't exactly match the release version, it still provided a whole lot of information on how the boot sequence worked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The most critical part of the install was nailing the alignment and reflow of not just one, but BOTH ball-grid-arrays for welding over a single rework profile.Oof.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the inner workings of "Zork," a pioneering text-based adventure game that has profoundly influenced the gaming industry. It discusses the game's innovative design, including its complex parser and rich narrative, which allow players to interact with a vast virtual world using natural language commands. The piece highlights the game's development history, its impact on contemporary storytelling in video games, and the ways it engaged players' imaginations, leading to its enduring legacy in interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone's interested, here's a pretty good overview of Infocom's internal development tooling (how they got from the ZIL source code to a compiled story file). https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-toAdditionally, this site is a really cool visualization that lets you play Zork while being able to see its internal game state and the corresponding source code to where you currently are. https://eblong.com/infocom/visi-zork1/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modern interactive fiction is pretty amazing.I like Zork a lot, but I've never made it even halfway through the game. Knowing that you can permanently lose by doing certain things (does breaking the mirror count? I can't remember) puts a damper on my enthusiasm. The infocom parser is pretty good, but I sometimes run into issues where I know what I need to do, but can't get the parser to accept my commands. This happened in planetfall where I needed to get a key under a grate, but eventually gave up and looked up what the parser wanted.Some modern additions are automatic maps and fast travel so you don't get lost in an infinite labyrinth and have to write your own maps (it was fun once, but I wouldn't want to do it each game). Fast travel is nice, so I can get back somewhere without having to type N N E NE N and so on.As for this thread and more relevant comments, I had no idea the parser variables were named after the authors. HN knowledge never ceases to amaze me. I wish there was a convention or something once a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Years ago I made some maps of things like which rooms of the game have the “sacred” bit, and what it means.If you’re interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/raldi/comments/10dtch/i_spent_my_we...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767132</guid></item><item><title>11.

I just got my green card last year, and it all kind of started with me asking you a question about H1B caps in a thread like this almost a decade ago. Super appreciate you doing this for people that are dreaming of a better future, dreaming of the American dream.Wish you the best!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am married to an american but we are leaving abroad and we never started the process for me to get a green card as we didn't plan to move to the US yet. Is it true that when I apply and get the card I then have a limited amount of time to move in, and if I don't then I would have to start the whole process again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi Peter, thank you for doing this AMA. I am on H1B and I recently lost my job. I only have about 50 days left to get a new job but I have a spouse who is on his own H1B. I wanted to see and find out legal and smooth options to buy more time for myself to find a new job - If anything, it would be those options that do not need me to leave the country and get stamping, if at all. My country of citizenship is India, by the way. If you can help us out, it would be really great. Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770125</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Think Twice Before Using GitHub Actions" discusses the pros and cons of using GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes. It highlights the advantages, such as integration with GitHub repositories and ease of use, while also cautioning against potential drawbacks like vendor lock-in, increased complexity, and security concerns. The author encourages developers to carefully evaluate their needs and consider alternative solutions before fully committing to GitHub Actions, emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach to tool selection in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; no way of running actions locallyMy policy is to never let pipeline DSLs contain any actual logic outside orchestration for the task, relying solely on one-liner build or test commands. If the task is more complicated than a one-liner, make a script for it in the repo to make it a one-liner. Doesn't matter if it's GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps (which has super cursed yaml), etc.This in turn means that you can do what the pipeline does with a one-liner too, whether manually, from a vscode launch command, a git hook, etc.This same approach can fix the mess of path-specific validation too - write a regular script (shell, python, JS, whatever you fancy) that checks what has changed and calls the appropriate validation script. The GitHub action is only used to run the script on PR and to prepare the CI container for whatever the script needs, and the same pipeline will always run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh boy, there's a special kind of hell I enter into everytime I set up new github actions. I wrote a blog post a few months ago about my pain[0] but one of the main things I've found over the years is you can massively reduce how horrible writing github actions is by avoiding prebuilt actions, and just using it as a handy shell runner.If you write behaviour in python/ruby/bash/hell-rust-if-you-really-want and leave your github action at `run: python some/script.py` then you'll have something that's much easy to test locally, and save yourself a lot of pain, even if you wind up with slightly more boilerplate.[0] https://benrutter.github.io/posts/github-actions/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of folks in this thread are focusing on the monorepo aspect of things. The "Pull request and required checks" problem exists regardless of monorepo or not.GitHub Actions allows you to only run checks if certain conditions are met, like "only lint markdown if the PR contains *.md files". The moment you decide to use such rules, you have the "Pull request and required checks" problem. No "monorepo" required.GitHub required checks at this time allow you to use with external services where GitHub has no idea what might run. For this reason, required checks HAVE to pass. There's no "if it runs" step. A required check on an external service might never run, or it might be delayed. Therefore, if GH doesn't have an affirmation that it passed, you can't merge.It would be wonderful if for jobs that run on GH where GH can know if the action is supposed to run, if required checks could be "require all these checks if they will be triggered".I have encountered this problem on every non-trivial project I use with GitHub actions; monorepo or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764762</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's reflections on failure and personal growth, emphasizing that failures are not a reflection of one's worth but rather opportunities for learning and development. The author shares personal experiences and insights gained from challenges faced, highlighting the importance of resilience, adaptability, and self-compassion in navigating setbacks. Ultimately, the piece encourages readers to reevaluate their perceptions of failure and view it as an integral part of their journey toward success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This line in the article resonated with me:&gt; First, it sets the stage for what was to come, and second, while it was unquestionably a success, it was not my success.I used to think that success was being successful the way I wanted and I was often frustrated because things were working but not because of the way I wanted them to. Turns out, it's doubly difficult to make things not only work but also work the way I want.I've since tried to be more open-minded and see wins that perhaps I didn't expect or want still as wins and it's made me feel a lot more successful. One might scoff and say I should hold myself to a higher standard, but at the end of the day, success is only an intrinsic feeling anyways. It's not a measurable metric so I might as well feel better about the progress I'm making.In the context of the article, the author could see these all as failures, but it sounds like some of these were pretty successful. In fact, the author concludes as much, finding happiness in the "failures". It's all an arbitrary label anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is currently a risk asymmetry in startup world that drives away people who could do good work.Investors know the long odds of success, so they invest in twenty to thirty companies and wait for one to get big.Founders and employees can't diversify like that, because you only have so many working years. To mitigate this we have decided to award successful founders with huge paydays as a lure to others to throw their hats in the ring. This has some malign effects, namely unsuccessful founders and employees get bupkis. It also attracts the wrong sort of personality to be a founder, selecting for too much risk appetite. (At least what I consider the wrong sort for building a sustainably profitable business.)I have an idea for how to solve this and I wonder if it's already been tried or if there are holes in it. The idea is to spread the risk of starting a company across something like an accelerator class. If one company in that class gets big, it would be contractually obligated to hire and grant shares from some pool to other members of that class. This would be at the cost of the winning founders' stakes.The upside for winners would be much lower, but the downside would be lower too. This would attract a different sort of person to this accelerator, and be a differentiator for selecting talent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My main lesson from running a startup: don't. And if you do, quit when the going gets tough. Perseverance does not pay off.Obviously it doesn't always end badly. But we get a massively skewed view from survivor bias.My life turned out pretty damn well once I got a plain ordinary job working for someone else. But I don't kid myself: when it comes to starting a startup, I did fail. The main lesson I learned was that I was always going to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771676</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the extensive network of bunkers built in Albania during the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, primarily between the 1950s and 1980s. These bunkers, designed for military defense against potential invasions, number in the hundreds of thousands and vary in size and function. After the fall of communism, many of these bunkers became abandoned or repurposed, raising questions about their historical significance and cultural impact. The site highlights their architectural features, strategic purpose, and the ongoing debate regarding their preservation and potential use in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728692"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had never heard of Enver Hoxha until I listened to the episodes about him on the Real Dictators podcast. Very wild stuff. I find it really fascinating and rather sobering that these invasive authoritarian governments can one day take root and control most or all of the rest of your life. I fear that people's complacency or thoughts that "surely it can't happen here" are part of what lets them rise in the first place, and I wonder just how quickly you can find yourself inside of one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Albania, for reasons related to my job I used to travel there multiple times a year until around 2010.Those bunkers are absolutely everywhere, even right in the middle of nowhere (I guess that's useful if you happen to get lost in the wilderness while hiking).In towns and cities they have been sometimes repurposed, e.g. I remember seeing that someone created a small cafe on the beach using one of the larger bunkers.The problem with reusing them is that the vast majority of the bunkers are of the smaller type (mostly below ground level, and on the inside there is barely enough room for a couple of people) and it's hard to find a new purpose for those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah Albanian mason who has been living in Italy since the 90s told me a story about bunkers. I cannot date it to a year nor assess its truth but here it is.A Minister (maybe Defense? Army? whatever) went to check the new bunkers. They looked good but he asked to the chief engineer how he could be sure that Hoxha would be satisfied with them."You know, if he thinks they are not good I'm dead.""They are very good.""So you must get in.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various patterns and best practices for using enums in TypeScript, highlighting the differences between numeric and string enums. It explains how to define and use enums effectively, including examples of both basic and advanced patterns, such as computed enums and enum member types. The article also emphasizes the importance of choosing the right enum type for specific use cases, providing insights into potential pitfalls and alternative approaches. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to leverage enums in TypeScript to enhance code readability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I'm missing in the comments here is that enums are a very early TypeScript feature. They were in there nearly from the start, when the project was still trying to find clarity on its goals and principles.Since then:- TypeScript added string literals and unions, eg `type Status = "Active" | "Inactive"`- TypeScript added `as const`, eg `const Status = { Active: 0, Inactive: 1 } as const`- TypeScript adopted a stance that features should only generate runtime code when it's on a standards trackEnums made some sense back when TS didn't have any of these. They don't really make a lot of sense now. I think they're effectively deprecated, to the point that I wonder why they don't document them as deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After almost a decade of TypeScript my recommendation is to not use TypeScript enums.Enums is going to make your TypeScript code not work in a future where TypeScript code can be run with Node.js or in browser when typings are added to JavaScript[1]Enums results in runtime code and in most cases you really want type enums. Use `type State = "Active" | "Inactive"` and so on instead. And if you really want an closed-ended object use `const State = { Active: 1, Inactive: 0 } as const`All of the examples in the article can be achieved without enums. See https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/PTAEFEA8EMFsAcA2B...[1] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use TypeScript in a way that leaves no TS traces in compiled JS. It means no enums, no namespaces, no private properties, etc.Great list of such features: https://www.totaltypescript.com/books/total-typescript-essen...TS has a great type system, the rest of the language is runtime overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766729</guid></item><item><title>17.

Real-time audio is very computationally intensive, after all.I've tried various embedded scripting languages in Rust, but Rhai probably has the best documentation and playground.For reference, see this survey:https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/09/16/survey-of-rust-embed...Recent Koto Lang also looks promising:https://koto.dev/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not going to dissuade anyone from having fun hobby projects.But legitimate question: why would I choose this over Lua, which is probably faster, super easy to embed and has a larger ecosystem.(Please, saying "Rust" or memory-safety can be assumed already to be understood, but not considered compelling arguments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a bunch of crates available for scripting in Rust/Bevy (Rhai, Rune, Luau, Teal, etc), anyone who've tried specifically Rhai with specifically Bevy before and could share their experience?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738753</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the Byzantine-Sassanian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire from the 4th to the 7th centuries. It highlights key battles, military strategies, and political motivations that fueled these wars, such as territorial disputes and the control of trade routes. The piece also discusses the impact of these wars on both empires, including significant territorial losses and how the prolonged conflict contributed to the eventual rise of Islamic powers in the region. Overall, it emphasizes the historical significance of these conflicts in shaping the geopolitics of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone is interested in Byzantium fall and why this war was so bad for both empires, read some more about Justinian's Plague which killed ~35-50% of population and also halved economical output. It took about 200 years to get to the same place population wise for most of the empire.Weirdly it didn't hit Persia as much outside of Mesopotamia, most historians estimate "only" ~20-30% of population died and shifted balance of power to Persian side, from almost renewed Roman Empire at 540 which most likely was getting back to ruling mediterranean world once again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in learning more about Byzantium there is a fantastic podcast The History of Byzantium[1] that follows on from Mike Duncan's The History of Rome Podcast.[1] https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tom Holland's "Shadow of the Sword" covers this and the broader context. "Justinian's Flea" is set a century earlier, but provides some grimly fascinating background: both these empires were still suffering the economic and demographic consequences of a plague. It's an under appreciated period of history, just as interesting as the Roman civil war imho.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732533</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article “The Two Hard Things” by Martin Fowler discusses the challenges faced in software development, particularly focusing on the complexities of building and maintaining systems that effectively perform difficult tasks. Fowler identifies two major hurdles: the difficulty of coordinating large teams and the continuous management of the evolving architecture of software systems. He emphasizes that while technical challenges can often be resolved with solutions, the social and organizational aspects of software development are more complex and require thoughtful attention to ensure successful outcomes. The piece highlights the importance of understanding these challenges to navigate the intricacies of software engineering effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm partial to this non-jokey take on two hard things:Phil Karlton famously said there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. I gather many folks suppose "naming things" is about whether to use camel-case or not, or picking specific symbols we use to name things, which is obviously trivial and mundane. But I always assumed Karlton meant the problem of making references work: the task of relating intension (names and ideas) and extension (things designated) in a reliable way, which is also the same topic as cache invalidation when that's about when to stop the association once invalid.https://web.archive.org/web/20130805122711/http://lambda-the...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s two hard problems in computer science: cacsynchronizing shared access to the same resource.he invalidation, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always reminds of the JWZ quote regarding regular expressions:&gt;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42763592</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;Parinfer is a tool designed to enhance the experience of editing Lisp code by automatically adjusting indentation and parentheses in real-time. It simplifies the programming process by allowing users to focus on writing code without worrying excessively about syntax, as it intelligently infers the structure based on either indentation or parentheses. The website provides detailed explanations of how Parinfer works, its various modes, installation instructions, and links to compatible editors, demonstrating its functionality and ease of use for Lisp developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766205"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love innovation in this space, and remember when Parinfer came out having some enlightening discussions with colleagues about how they efficiently edited code.I've since settled on Lispy and Lispyville in Emacs, and have run into very few issues over the past few years.There's something about Lispy’s style of editing that appeals to me — the use of hugging parentheses to enable its bindings, combined with Lispyville making all of my Vim bindings safe, makes me very happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Parinfer with IntelliJ (Cursive) ever since I started developing Clojure professionally back in 2018. The best thing about Parinfer, or at least the implementation in Cursive, is that it doesn't preclude you from also mixing in some Paredit commands too.When you start out with Clojure/Lisp  and you aren't totally used to parenthesis you can just use Parinfer to get editor behaviour similar to developing Python. It removes a major pain point of migrating to a Lisp. It used to be the case that you were forced to learn Paredit pretty much from the start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parinfer was instrumental to me learning Clojure. Paredit felt like operating an airplane cockpit, and Parinfer took that experience and made it much closer to just writing prose, for which I am forever grateful.I remember people, including Rich Hickey, scoffing at it when it came out, which seemed like kind of a snobbish reaction to something that lowers the barriers of entry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766205</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great app! I've been building something similar, but for less advanced language learners, who wouldn't understand definitions in their target language.My app [1] is basically a combination of SRS flashcards with an ebook/YouTube/Website reader. Unlike Anki though, AI creates example sentences, definitions, images and audio.I find it interesting that you want to get inspired by Duolingo. My approach is to have the most efficient grind possible - no gamification. I've found Duolingo was wasting so much of my time with exercises that did not really teach me anything and took a long time to complete + the XP points/levels etc. were quite distracting.[1] https://vocabuo.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, quick suggestion as a PhD Linguistics candidate and avid language learner!The best way I've found to identify vocabulary most important to my life is through journaling in the language I'm trying to learn. Describing exactly what I did that day, my thoughts, etc, as best I can.I had thought of doing the journal entries digitally and gathering dictionary headwords from such journal entries, whether they're written in my mother tongue (English) or not, and use the built dictionary lists to drill vocab.Traditionally you'd use a lemmatizer with a morphosyntactic tagger for the language to identify the dictionary words, but AI is serviceable these days to easily identify dictionary words from long-form text in many languages, though honestly would be surprised if AI outperforms the traditional methods already.Good luck and have fun :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks really good. I wish I had had something like this many years ago when I was studying languages.Somebody has already suggested adding spaced repetition and audio, which I agree with completely.One more suggestion: In addition to having the LLM give you the meaning and example for the context in which you originally saw the word, also ask it to provide the word’s other main meanings and examples of it being used in those senses. You might encounter a word first in a slang or technical sense; while it’s useful to learn that meaning, it’s also important to learn other, more common meanings.Below are some examples of words you might encounter first in technical contexts but would also be worth knowing in their more general meanings. (Examples suggested and defined by ChatGPT o1.)canonicalReligious/General: Relating to a canon (e.g., church law) or a recognized body of works.Math/Computing: Conforming to a standard or simplest form (e.g., “canonical form” of an equation).resolutionGeneral: A firm decision or determination (often heard in “New Year’s resolution”).Tech/Imaging: The detail an image holds, typically measured in pixels, dots per inch (DPI), etc.protocolDiplomatic/General: The official procedure or set of rules governing state or ceremonial events.Computing: A set of conventions and rules for transmitting data between electronic devices.fluxGeneral: Continuous movement or change, often implying instability.Physics/Engineering: The amount of some quantity (e.g., heat, magnetism) passing through a given area over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770200</guid></item><item><title>22.

Doubly boneheaded considering the graphics API they developed, Vulkan, literally does that via SPIR-V!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can understand wanting to prioritize support for the cards people want to use most, but they should still plan to write software support for all the cards that have hardware support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772170</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started cooking ice cream this summer. I bought an ice cream machine that can yield 1L of ice cream in 30 minutes, and prepared about 30L, sometimes sourcing material from the garden (strawberries, raspberries, cherries, figs and blackberries). If you enjoy the taste of fresh figs (which I don't normally because of the texture of the fruit) it is an incredible way to preserve it.The best ice cream I made was blueberry + coco cream + lime. Highly recommend it. Coco cream as a substitute for water in sorbet is an amazing trick.Shared this with a friend yesterday:    1. **Creaminess (smooth, creamy texture)**  
    Creaminess ↑ ⇔ Cream ↑ + Eggs ↑ + Sugar ↑  
    Creaminess ↓ ⇔ Water ↑ + Fresh fruits (high in water) ↑  
    
    2. **Lightness (airy texture)**  
    Lightness ↑ ⇔ Milk ↓ + Cream ↓ + Eggs ↓ + Sugar ↓  
    Lightness ↑ ⇔ Air incorporation (whipping) ↑  
    
    3. **Stability (avoiding crystallization)**  
    Stability ↑ ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Eggs (yolks) ↑ + Alcohol ↑  
    Stability ↓ ⇔ Water ↑ + Uneven freezing temperature ↑  
    
    4. **Density (weight in the mouth)**  
    Density ↑ ⇔ Fats (cream, butter) ↑ + Eggs ↑ + Sugar ↑  
    Density ↓ ⇔ Incorporated air ↑ + Water ↑  
    
    5. **Melting Temperature (softer or harder out of the freezer)**  
    Melting Temperature ↑ (softer) ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Alcohol ↑ + Air ↑  
    Melting Temperature ↓ (harder) ⇔ Water ↑ + Freezing temperature ↓  
    
    6. **Sweetness (perceived sugar)**  
    Sweetness ↑ ⇔ Sugar ↑ + Sweet fruit puree ↑  
    Sweetness ↓ ⇔ Acidity (lemon, vinegar) ↑ + Acidic fruits ↑  
    
    7. **Crystallization (grainy or smooth texture)**  
    Crystallization ↑ ⇔ Water ↑ + Poorly mixed ingredients ↑  
    Crystallization ↓ ⇔ Fats ↑ + Sugar ↑ + Proper agitation ↑&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best ice cream recipe ever I got from a physicist:Cream + sugar + vanilla, stir until dissolved. Slowly add liquid nitrogen while stirring fervently until sufficiently frozen.The stirring in of the liquid nitrogen not only freezes the cream, it prevents any cristallisation and fluffs up the ice cream by evaporating. Truly delicious!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic Ben&amp; Jerry's recipe in an ice cream machine is pretty much unbeatable if you're looking for traditional ice cream. On the other hand, I've tried, without much luck, lower calorie ice creams using substitute sugars like allulose. Unfortunately, they haven't turned out very well. It really is the combination of real sugar, fat, protein, and all that that comes together in the cold to make the magic happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42724323</guid></item><item><title>24.

I-line refers to a specific wavelength of UV light—365nm, and the stepper is the machine that focuses it on the silicon wafer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not clear to me where the novelty is in this... people have been doing similar stuff for ages, and the performance of the optics here leaves a bit to be desired as well.Sure we can mass produce these, but we can also mass produce wafer-scale lenses, and in any serious application, a normal metamaterial lens would justify the higher cost with its performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42737401</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Authors are requesting Meta to provide access to their torrent client logs and seeding data as part of an investigation into the illegal distribution of their works through AI platforms. The initiative is aimed at combatting piracy, as the authors believe that Meta's data could help identify individuals involved in sharing their content without permission. This legal action highlights the ongoing struggle between copyright holders and those who utilize technology to share or access copyrighted material unlawfully.&lt;/p&gt;

There's just no other viable alternative for efficiently acquiring large quantities of text data. Buying millions of ebooks online would take a lot of effort, downloading data from publishers isn't a thing that can be done efficiently (assuming tech companies negotiated and threw money at them), the only efficient way to access large volumes of media is piracy.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports that the Netherlands has agreed to align its export controls on certain advanced chip equipment with those of the United States, specifically targeting technologies produced by ASML Holdings. This move is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to restrict China's access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology, thereby ensuring that critical technologies do not enhance China’s military capabilities. The Dutch government's decision reflects increased international cooperation on technology exports amid rising geopolitical tensions and a global push to safeguard semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ASML is so interesting. Its like sci-fi that one firm in the Netherlands knows how to make the most complicated machine ever made, and no one else can do it.And it is arguably the most complicated machine ever made. 50,000 times a second, the EUV lithography machine hits a 25 micron drop of molten tin that is moving at 70 meters per second with two co-ordinated lasers, the first hit to change the shape of the drop of tin in exactly the right way, the second hit to vaporise it, creating Extreme Ultraviolet Light at the right wavelength to etch chip designs onto silicon at "5nm process" sizes. Some labs can cobble together something similar as a proof of concept, but not well enough to make it feasible for mass production of chips.Video about the light souce - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ge2RcvDlgwNo one else in the world is able to make these machines. If you buy one it costs $150m and gets shipped to you in forty containers on specially adapted planes. Very few firms have the resources/know how to even run the machines - which is what makes TSMC so important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I regret to inform the various nationalists here this wasn't really developed by one group.  ASML signed contracts for research and technology from multiple different countries.  The Netherlands isn't being strong armed here.  It is having to comply with a heavily negotiated contract that they signed decades ago when they aquired a US based firm using export controlled US DOE research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And what are ASML and the Netherlands in general getting out of it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42729488</guid></item><item><title>30.

We considered something like “Sp” or “P” but one founder made the suggestion of using “X” since it's a common variable name in programming and thus makes sense since the name “Y Combinator” itself is a programming term.This chain of reasoning seems totally disconnected? "While trying to come up with a single letter to denote spring, since S was taken, we decided on... a common variable name instead" ??? what happened to denoting spring in there? Am I missing some clever reference? Is spring in particular the season for common variables?The spring constant (in physics) is denoted by the letter "k", why not use that? I know its not programming, but at least it denotes spring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;V25, the Vernal YC 2025 batch!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770629</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the meaning of the message "supports DRM functions and may not be fully accessible" in the context of SATA (Serial ATA) devices. It explains that this message indicates that while the SATA drive has capabilities related to Digital Rights Management (DRM), access to all functionalities may be restricted or limited. The discussion includes potential reasons for this limitation, such as hardware restrictions or manufacturer implementations, and emphasizes the importance of understanding this message for users dealing with SATA storage devices, particularly in scenarios involving operating system installations and data accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think in this very case it has anything to do with digital rights management. It detects an Intel SATA SSD, SSDSCKJF360A5L a disk that supports ATA Trusted Send/Receive commands used to interface with on-disk encryption features. Specifically 5B to 5F (reference: https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_Command_Matrix).To make things even more confusing, kernel refers to the command between 5C and 5F with the acronym TPM, and requires `libata.allow_tpm=1` command line parameter to be passed to allow issuing them. (kernel source reference: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/drivers/ata/lib...), which has _nothing to do_ with the trusted platform module TPM, just another TLA clash.Here's the original commit from 2008. The naming is very likely through misassociation. TCG: Trusted Computing Group is most known for creating TPM specification. Another thing they work on is the OPAL specification for self encrypting drives. Author possibly clumped them into the same thing. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ae8d4ee7ff429136c8b...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The S in SD stands for secure, and can be used for DRM purposes as well.Windows Phone 7 is the only one I know of that used it: https://web.archive.org/web/20110219215401/http://support.mi...Once the SD card was bonded to your phone it was not reuseable elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So... one more reason to not buy the content and pirate it instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42765480</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My brother acquired an aging app (from an aging founder) built on Delphi used by many dozens (or low hundred) of the world’s leading shipping, energy and commodities companies, used as a standard to calculate “laytime” and “demurge” (myriad of fees associated when a ship docks into a port). It used to cost $5k for a perpetual license tied to usb based key that had to be plugged in to activate. If you wanted to use on two machines, you had to buy two licenses with two keys.Customers in the US and Europe hated the usb, especially during COVID. In random places of Africa, where they greatly valued the single perpetual license, it persists. From my perspective, I don’t see anything positive from being an installed application for this use case - he had to hop through so many security hoops that when he rolled out the web solution IT departments breathed a huge sigh of relief and thanked him.Over a period of about 2 years he converted almost everyone to saas and 4x’d the annual revenue. That also generated enough fcf to hire more developers to ship more features.Saas is generally the way to go. Installed apps are common in financial services and industrial applications. I can think of a bunch of other niche examples but I personally would never pursue this model. We put bugs into production from time to time and it is nice to be able to instantly roll out updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legal changes are making it increasingly very difficult to sell perpetual licenses.  For example, in Germany, a new law recently took effect that clarifies that if you sell a software license for a given period of time, you're liable to provide whatever updates/support the customer may need over the course of the software's licensing period to enable the customer to keep running it, at no additional cost, regardless of what it costs you.  I'm not a lawyer and may be getting this wrong, but if you're contemplating getting into the business of selling perpetual licenses in software, definitely check with a lawyer.  It's not like it was in the 90s.In the 90s, a large driver of recurring revenue for software was that when the OS and hardware landscape changed, you made a new version of the software adapted to that change, and then, if customers wanted to upgrade their OS or hardware (frequently for reasons unrelated to your product), that made them come back to you to pay for the new version of your product.  Under the new legal regime, you would be forced to give them the update for free, so if you sell an actual perpetual software license, you have a fixed amount of revenue on one hand, and a potentially unlimited liability to incur additional costs on the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jetbrains is still selling their IDE using old method as well as new. You can buy perpetual license but if you want upgrades, you pay again. That's how I bought my Clion and still use it personally from time to time. Buying a plan for me is too expensive - I do tinkering at home rarely. The same with any Photoshop or Lightroom - I bought a last available license and won't buy the cloud version especially because it has exit fees.Minecraft - having huge community - still sells lifetime license with upgrades. I wouldn't pay for it monthly neither.I also bought some software like GuitarTuna perpetual license and they turned it off (the possibility of buying it that way) but I still use it this way (despite they used to nag me to pay monthly). The problem is that one private person cannot hold to many subscriptions. It's killing the budget. Keep this in mind. Also companies tend to switch to cheaper subscriptions after they calculated where did they go in terms of monthly payments.I know I didn't answer your question because my perspective is different, but I wanted to highlight the other side of the deal. If you want $$$$ go for it. If you have a mission or want to gather community or you want small people to use it from time to time - maybe hybrid both solutions is the way to go?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42764185</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Alligator Eggs" explores the concept of self-organizing systems and emergent behavior, using the example of alligator nesting and how temperature-dependent sex determination in eggs results in varying numbers of male and female alligators. It discusses how environmental factors influence the development of these animals and emphasizes the interconnectedness of biological processes with ecological dynamics. Through this lens, it highlights broader themes of complexity in nature and the ways systems can spontaneously organize to produce diverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the creation and development of Community Notes, a platform that allows users to collaboratively contribute notes and context to online content, enhancing user understanding and engagement. It details the motivations behind the initiative, the collaborative process involving various stakeholders, and the innovative features of Community Notes that ensure transparency and reliability. The piece emphasizes the importance of community involvement in shaping digital discourse and improving information accuracy online.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a very interesting design space. How to design public forums where people can share ideas and eventually improve their knowledge collectively.There are very successful instances of that, for instance MathOverflow.But I don't know what can be achieved when a good chunk of participants don't agree on some basic rules beforehand, such as logic and good faith. It's a bit like consensus with byzantine failures, maybe there's an impossibility theorem here and large social network should be limited to cat videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven't read the entire interview yet, but I have to say so far it has been very helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a useful piece, thanks for posting it.Flagging of misinformation has become a controversial topic but for me personally it strikes me as odd to even do such a thing at all. Or rather, if there's a need for such a system it suggests the platform has already failed, in that people are not able to use it discerningly, whether because of the posters, readers, system, or some interaction thereof. If they are able to do so, why have it?I've posted this elsewhere but the nature of community notes makes it a bit murkier. If Platform A introduces misinformation flags, you can always compartmentalize it as the platform inserting itself into the conversation one way or another, but with something like community notes, you're left wondering at some level "what happened here?" in a way that's similar to upvotes or downvotes.The point about people trusting community notes I'm not sure what to do with either. Other studies I've seen cited elsewhere suggest that there's a very high false negative rate, so are they doing what they're supposed to? How are people interpreting the unflagged posts?The whole thing seems well-intended at some level but also missing the forest for the trees or something. I don't want community notes or misinformation flags, I just want discourse and I want to be able to ignore certain sources of posts and be more exposed to others.It's an interesting idea and I'm not even sure I'm objecting to its implementation. I guess it's more so that I feel like there's an overconfidence in all of the misinformation flagging methods, and this overconfidence is maybe taking attention away from more serious problems, like how people consume and evaluate information, or how information networks are being controlled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772518</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;Blinkenlights refers to a nostalgic installation that recreates the visual and auditory aesthetic of early computer systems using light displays. Originally popularized in the late 1990s, Blinkenlights projects were often set up in large urban environments, transforming buildings into giant interactive displays. The term itself also embodies the early computer jargon, used to describe the blinking lights on equipment that conveyed the status and activity of the machines. The projects often engage the public through interactive elements and serve as a playful homage to the history of computing and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have fond memories of soldering my own small Blinkenlight, a BlinkenLED, around 2005 as a kid. This was before the Raspberry Pi was around - it was just a 10x20 LED matrix controlled by 20 shift registers [0], connected to the serial port of an old DOS laptop. I remember that it was trivial to shift the individual bits through the serial port with a small BASIC program.Soldering this thing, however, was a challenge. It was basically 200 LEDs on a perfboard, the cathodes all connected by a continuous strip of non-isolated wire (I think I used paper clips for that), and the anodes all individually connected to the shift register output pins via flexible wires. It took me several weeks to finish this with a cheap 10 EUR soldering iron from my local hardware store, and it did not look nice from the back.It worked very reliable, however, and I used it to display the time, the date and some small animations for some years.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought went to Project Blinkenlights https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blinkenlights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have one of these [0]; it's fun and a good topic of conversation when we have visitors over.[0] https://www.tindie.com/products/obso/pdp-11-replica-kit-the-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42728392</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked, fortunately briefly, in Apple’s AI/ML organization.It was difficult to believe the overhead, inefficiency, and cruft. Status updates in a wiki page tens of thousands of words long in tables too large and ill-formatted for anyone to possibly glean. Several teams clamboring to work on the latest hot topic for that year’s WWDC — in my year it was “privacy-preserving ML”. At least four of five teams that I knew of.They have too much money and don’t want to do layoffs because they’re afraid of leaks, so they just keep people around forever doing next to nothing, since it’s their brand and high-margin hardware that drives the business. It was baked into the Apple culture to “go with the flow”, a refrain I heard many times, which I understood to mean stand-by and pretend to be busy while layers of bureaucracy obscure the fact that a solid half of the engineers could vanish to very little detriment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am probably suffering confirmation bias. But that said, this LLM smartness continues to be impressively shit. There's a level of "yea that's cool" but it's outweighed by "that'd be wrong, and suggests you understand nothing about me or my data"It's a little (ok a lot) like targeted ads. I'll believe it's targeted when it tries to sell me ancillary, related goods for e.g. that fridge freezer I bought, not show me ads for fridge freezer  I now don't need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how long it will take for "guaranteed AI-free!" to become a serious marketing argument for some products or services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42744785</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the discovery of thriving microbial life deep within the Earth's subsurface, revealing that these organisms could be living several miles below the surface in environments previously thought to be uninhabitable. It discusses the significance of these findings for understanding life's resilience and adaptability, as well as their implications for astrobiology in the search for extraterrestrial life. The research highlights the complex ecosystems that exist in these depths, driven by geothermal energy and chemical processes, suggesting that much of Earth's biodiversity is still hidden underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildfires in California are significantly undermining the state's climate progress, according to research by scientists at the University of Chicago. The study reveals that the increase in wildfire incidents since the early 2000s has not only released vast amounts of carbon dioxide but also harmed the long-term carbon storage capacity of forests. This erosion of climate gains poses a challenge to California's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate resilience. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved forest management and fire prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of wildfires on climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should make prescribed forest burns a high priority- they burn the forest floor but spare the large trees- smoothing out carbon release.There’s evidence that prescribed burns may lead to less carbon emissions [1].In chaparral regions like the LA fires, prescribed burns might not help with carbon emissions. And for fire suppression I suspect there’s only so much that can be done to be responsive enough to recent hydrology changes.[1] https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=116626&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wildfire carbon emissions are very different from fossil fuel carbon emissions. Wildfires are releasing carbon that trees and other vegetation pulled out of the atmosphere in the relatively recent past. It's carbon-neutral for the same reason that burning firewood to heat your home is carbon-neutral.Fossil fuel carbon emissions are releasing carbon that has been sequestered for millions of years. It's a net increase in current atmospheric carbon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This only really makes sense to say, if the wildfire are a result of climate policy. Which this article doesn't seem to be claiming.Also I don't think the stuff that burns in these would have otherwise ended up buried/fossilized, so maybe it shouldn't actually count at all?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762813</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The document N3317 presents a proposal for the C programming language, focused on enhancing and formalizing the C standard to improve language clarity and functionality. It discusses changes and updates to various aspects of the language, including data types, memory management, and standard library functions. The proposal aims to address existing issues, propose new features, and ensure that C continues to evolve while maintaining backward compatibility, ultimately enhancing usability and performance for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of this. The suggested effects have some ambiguities. For example, does sprintf imply the errno effect that's only required under POSIX? Does printf imply file or just system depending on implementation?I'm also not sure what you really gain from this effort beyond mut annotations. It doesn't give you a way to detect or eliminate UB. It doesn't allow the compiler to optimize pure functions better like the reproducible directive does. A better effects system could do these things, but this is an unhappy middle ground between something simple enough to actually get standardized and something powerful enough to provide useful guarantees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See also:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41464994 - C2y Proposal: Essential Effects for C (2024-09-06, 30 comments)Is there a corresponding proposal for C++?

&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that Pluto's largest moon, Charon, may have formed from a "kiss and capture" event, where Pluto and another celestial body collided, allowing Charon to be captured by Pluto's gravity. This theory challenges previous understandings of Charon's origin, proposing that it resulted from a less violent interaction than once thought, adding depth to the study of celestial mechanics and how moons can form around dwarf planets.&lt;/p&gt;

These were the first soil composition measurements ever registered from near the moon’s south pole, and the scientists found that all of them included ferroan anorthosite, a type of white rock.""That finding supports the idea that the moon was once enveloped by magma. “A key prediction of the lunar magma ocean hypothesis is the presence of a largely anorthositic crust,” Vadawale tells Popular Science’s Tom Hawking. This is because during the moon’s magma ocean phase, dense rocks—like magnesium-rich mafic rocks—would have sunk inward, while lighter rocks—like ferroan anorthosite—would have floated to the top."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753542</guid></item><item><title>49.

It emphasizes the importance of developing this skill in order to cope effectively with challenges, both in personal and professional settings. The piece outlines various strategies for improving frustration tolerance, such as mindfulness practices, cognitive restructuring, and setting realistic goals. It encourages readers to view frustrations as opportunities for growth and resilience, ultimately fostering a healthier mindset and greater emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I  learned that the world of men as it exists today is a bureaucracy. This is an obvious truth, of course, though it is also one the ignorance of which causes great suffering.“But moreover, I discovered, in the only way that a man ever really learns anything important, the real skill that is required to succeed in a bureaucracy. I mean really succeed: do good, make a difference, serve. I discovered the key. This key is not efficiency, or probity, or insight, or wisdom. It is not political cunning, interpersonal skills, raw IQ, loyalty, vision, or any of the qualities that the bureaucratic world calls virtues, and tests for. The key is a certain capacity that underlies all these qualities, rather the way that an ability to breathe and pump blood underlies all thought and action.“The underlying bureaucratic key is the ability to deal with boredom. To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breathe, so to speak, without air.“The key is the ability, whether innate or conditioned, to find the other side of the rote, the picayune, the meaningless, the repetitive, the pointlessly complex. To be, in a word, unborable.“It is the key to modern life. If you are immune to boredom, there is literally nothing you cannot accomplish.David Foster Wallace, The Pale King&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having an organisation of highly-frustration-tollerant people is a great way of getting an organisation where nothing ever gets fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things I often find missing in articles and discussion of these topics here on HN is the understanding that different people are really quite different.Articles or comments like this often read like moral judgements. You should be X to succeed. Being X works for me, and it should for you. If X doesn't work for you, it's your problem. There's usually little considering that achieving X may be significantly easier for some than others, or that there may be other ways of achieving a persons goals that work better for them.This article is better than most in that it has a well defined scope, large organizations. I don't have any major problems with the content, other than I'd like some more time spent on wether the model they are applying is really as applicable to the situation as they claim.I must admit to some bias, as I do no do well in large organizations, and the description of frustration in the article doesn't resonate with my experience of frustration at these orgs. I left the last place I worked because it was bad for my mental health. In many ways it was a dream job. It payed extremely well, I liked the people I worked with, and it wasn't that hard. Eventually though, I just couldn't do it anymore, and left for a small startup. I didn't realize how bad it was until I noticed I could still feel myself physically unwinding three months later.I've been at this company for three years, and still love working here. It's absolutely not frustration free. I am however, much better equipped to handle the kinds of frustrations I face at this new company.The author of the article says:"It’s like learning to navigate a bustling city. At first, the traffic, noise, and crowds seem like overwhelming obstacles. But over time, you see these elements as essential aspects of urban life."I've experienced this first hand after moving to NYC, and it's true, but it's also important to remember that some people just don't like cities, and that's Ok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770986</guid></item><item><title>1. 0-click deanonymization attack targeting Signal, Discord, other platforms</title><link>https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/45a3cdfa52246f1d1201c1e8cdef6117</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a basic web application using the Flask framework in Python. It covers the installation of necessary tools, setting up the Flask environment, creating a simple application structure, and writing code to handle routes and templates. The guide emphasizes best practices in organizing code and includes examples for rendering HTML, handling form submissions, and displaying dynamic content, making it a useful resource for beginners looking to learn web development with Flask.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So if you send a picture to a Signal user, it's retrieved via cloudflare, and cached in a data center near that user; now you can look up the cache status and find the data center used. I'd say "deanonymization" is stretching it, unless the user is in the middle of nowhere (no other users near the data center). But interesting writeup anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool writeup with some interesting techniques and approaches!I'll echo the other comments and say "deanonymization" is stretching the definition of the word, along with "grab the user's location", as it isn't anything near precise. 150 miles is approx. a 2-hour drive on the highway from Atlanta, GA to Augusta, GA. In that radius, there's probably 700,000+ people.I do think the auto-retrieve attachment feature of Signal is slightly concerning, as for a private messenger I'd expect there to be an option to turn it off (like turning off JS in Tor). I don't know if I'm not looking deep enough, but there doesn't seem to be a feature for that.Signal appears to take a useful-by-default approach that balances privacy and ease-of-use in order to encourage adoption by the masses, I'd assume most people that are really concerned are hardening Signal, similar to what is in this guide: https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2022/07/07/signal-con... . They've always recommended a VPN / proxy + a modification of settings for more high-security scenarios.Caching isn't going anywhere, and neither is CloudFlare. The DoSing days of old in P2P multiplayer lobbies with exposed IPs seemed to carry more of a threat than this, CloudFlare's response seems to be the best out of the 3. Caching sensitive information is never recommended and the onus is on the application doing the communicating to tell their CDN / middle-service to not cache specific items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! Contrary to some of the other posters I think this definitely counts as deanonymization, or at least is close enough. How anonymous would satoshi be today if we had his location to within 250 miles?Repeated applications of this attack (maybe disguised somehow?) could let you track someone’s travel over time, and it is usually only takes 4-5 zip code sized locations to uniquely identify someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780816</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a technical analysis of the TAC-1 firearm, specifically focusing on its design and functionality for potential reverse engineering and modding. It highlights the components of the TAC-1, including mechanisms and operational characteristics, and provides insights into how these aspects can be altered or improved. The piece includes detailed illustrations and step-by-step explanations to facilitate understanding for those interested in firearms modification, while also addressing safety considerations and best practices for such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I experienced the trust factor (banning, w/o banning officially) issues on my Linux CS:GO account in 2021, dropping to yellow and then red. This made it difficult to find teammates, as I was constantly matched with cheaters.I discovered I wasn't alone, as many other Linux users with Radeon GPUs and 16GB+ VRAM were experiencing similar problems. We created a GitHub issue to track the problem and try to find a solution: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630After some investigation, we found that Valve was punishing Linux users with certain hardware configurations (radeon cards with &gt;=16GB of VRAM, which were quite new at this time).Eventually, after a user reached out to gaben directly, the issue was fixed: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630#...I suspect this was because Valve was preparing to launch the Steam Deck, and gaben wanted to ensure that Linux users had better experience with the device (just a guess).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheating is ultimately a human problem. You can have some safeguards and heuristics like the ones the article describe, to weed out 90% the most blatant cheaters, so I think anticheats like these are fundamentally a good thing. But the anti-cheat can and should err on the safe side because ultimately it should be the players and admins themselves that sort this out.Online multiplayer games must (yes must) take place on servers with human admins. Admins should be present for a majority of the time any players are playing.Ideally with admins the players recognize. Bonus points if players themselves can perform some moderation when no admin is present (votekick, voteban etc). There is no difference between kicking cheaters and kicking people who are abusing chat etc.  Obviously this means that "private" or "community" servers are the only viable types of server for online multiplayer games.This process of policing cheaters and other abuse can not be something that is done via a reporting system and handled asynchronously. Kicking/banning must be done by the admins of the game, and it must be handled quickly.If you are considering buying/playing an online multiplayer game and it doesn't have this functionality (e.g. the only way to play online is via matchmaking on servers set up by the publisher, and the only way cheaters and chat abusers are policed is via some web form) then please, avoid that game.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a remarkable 417-megapixel panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy, which took over a decade to create. The project involved capturing thousands of images to stitch together a detailed view of the galaxy, showcasing intricate details and features not visible to the naked eye. The final image provides a stunning visual representation of Andromeda, highlighting the dedication and effort put into this long-term astronomical endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mandatory recommendation of the Gigapixels of Andromeda [4K] [1] video/version. Especially with this particular song(!), as the 8K version [2] has a different one which doesn't really give the chills... Although, 60fps makes the image much better. Maybe combine the song from [1] with the video from [2]...The source picture is the 1.5 gigapixels version (69.536 x 22.230 pixels).Fun fact: watching the video on certain TV's makes them flicker wildly. Probably because they struggle with many dots in motion. On a monitor it works flawlessly.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9bNqBeAtC8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny how come the original post by NASA was seen be fewer people here on HN:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731686I guess it has to do with the time and day of posting something, on how much it will be upvoted and hopefully rise out of the new posts pit :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never seen Andromeda, even when I was in a deep dark sky area and could remember where to look.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses former President Donald Trump's views on artificial intelligence, specifically criticizing companies like OpenAI for their AI advancements, which he perceives as a threat to the workforce and society. Trump emphasizes the need for America to lead in AI development and suggests that regulations may be necessary to ensure its safe use. The piece also highlights the ongoing competition in the AI sector among major tech firms, including OpenAI, Oracle, and investments from entities like SoftBank, and frames the dialogue around the future implications of AI technology on jobs and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

On this 5-year-old laptop running firefox on windows, the loader animations are prone to stuttering jank.  Perhaps this is just the nature of running an animation through a react reconciler, but also these loaders should be able to go around react without invoking a render function or reconciler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for posting this, I like it very much.Furthermore, I would like to see a simple email client written using it, which can be controlled using only the keyboard (on mobile devices) or with the mouse (when at home).

Base16 would likely be enough given the web has opacity and a bunch of other ways to slightly modify colors. I'd also like to see how much of this doesn't need to be React™, even if your application is entirely React.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses unusual and intriguing phenomena related to electric walls, particularly the effects of high-voltage and electric fields on various materials and living beings. It explores the scientific principles underlying these phenomena, including the behavior of electrons and ionization, and how these factors contribute to the creation of electric fields. Additionally, the piece shares anecdotal experiences and visual illustrations to engage the reader's curiosity about the intersection of electricity and its unusual interactions with common objects. Overall, it aims to educate readers on the fascinating aspects of electricity that are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of the time I turned myself into a Van de Graff generator at work.I was a theater projectionist, back when you had 20 minute reels you had to constantly change, while babysitting two high-voltage, water-cooled, carbon arc projectors. Sometimes the film would break and you’d have to splice it. So when the theater got a print in, you had to count and log the number of splices for each reel, then the next theater would do the same and retire the print when it got too spliced up (plus, sometimes if it was the last night of a run, some lazy projectionists would splice it in place with masking tape and then you’d have to fix it). Sometimes you had to splice in new trailers or remove inappropriate ones as well.Anyway, you counted splices by rapidly winding through the reel with a benchtop motor with a speed control belted to a takeup reel while the source spun freely. Then, while letting the film slide between your fingers, counting each “bump” you felt as it wound through. I was told to ground myself by touching the metal switch plate of the speed control knob with my other hand. One night I forgot and let go until my hair started rising. I’d gone through most of the reel at a very high speed and acquired its charge.I reached for the switch plate and shot an 8-10” arcing discharge between the plate and my fingers.Lesson learned, I held the switch plate from then on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually work with high voltage for a living, and I have high skepticism about this story. While it is technically possible if you work out the math and somehow get an extremely dense e-field flux, from a practical standpoint it might well be impossible. HV like they describe, especially in high humidity, really likes to equalize itself in a big flash.I strongly suspect instead is that there was a spot where you could really feel the e-field, and people just through rumor and story telling morphed it into "the wall".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ever notice how UFO and Bigfoot sightings mostly went away once everyone had a 4K60 video camera in their pockets?One thread about this in 1995, and then the phenomenon is never seen nor heard about again . . .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42782914</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/E5aqe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is only surprising if you expect that every postdoc should stay in academia, or would want to. Being in academia is not the only way to do research, and is not a prerequisite to using your degree. The private sector is a thing, and postdocs leaving academia can do perfectly good work in their field while actually making a grown up salary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not surprising. I quit after about a year. I could have stayed on but I realized that it just wasn't right for me. By then I had figured out that most research is done by post docs and phd students and it doesn't pay very well. Not that I cared about the money but I started thinking about what is next and did not like the perspective.Professors are basically there to manage the process and haggle for funding. They tend to not be very hands-on with research for the simple reason that that's not their main job. They mostly delegate that to people in their team.And you can only become a professor by doing post docs, landing some tenured position and then maybe they'll make you a professor somewhere. It's a long, uncertain process and the failure modes are basically ending up with a teaching position or being otherwise stuck in some faculty mostly not doing research. Nothing wrong with that. But not what I was after. And a lot of teachers in university are basically people that dropped out of the process somehow.Anyway, the whole management thing had no appeal to me: I did not want to be a manager managing other people doing all the fun stuff (research) while basically dealing with a lot of bureaucratic shit. Not my idea of fun, at least.So, I left. It was the only logical thing to do. I worked for Nokia Research for a while after that. But the career paths there weren't a whole lot different there. And the whole thing started imploding a bit after the iphone launch.These days I do startups and a bit of consulting. Mostly as a CTO, and I'm very hands on which is just how I like it. Inevitably, there's a bit of management involved as well. But I like what I do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777193</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fascination with certain prime numbers, which are so memorable that they capture the interest of both mathematicians and enthusiasts. It highlights how specific primes, like the first few hundred or those with unique properties, attract attention and even lead individuals to actively search for them. The piece explores the psychological aspects of why people find these numbers significant and the cultural or mathematical value they hold in various contexts. Overall, it emphasizes the intersection of human curiosity and mathematical discovery regarding prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you were around in the 80's and 90's you might have already memorized the prime 8675309 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny).  It's also a twin prime, so you can add 2 to get another prime (8675311).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My family’s phone number when I was a child was both a palindrome and a prime: 7984897.My parents had had the number for two decades without noticing it was a palindrome. I still remember my father’s delight when he got off a phone call with a friend: “Doug just said, ‘Hey, I dialed your number backwards and it was still you who answered.’ I never noticed that before!”A few years later, around 1973, one of the other math nerds at my high school liked to factor seven-digit phone numbers by hand just for fun. I was then taking a programming class—Fortran IV, punch cards—and one of my self-initiated projects was to write a prime factoring program. I got the program to work, and, inspired by my friend, I started factoring various phone numbers. Imagine my own delight when I learned that my home phone number was not only a palindrome but also prime.Postscript: The reason we hadn’t noticed that 7984897 was a palindrome was because, until around 1970, phone numbers in our area were written and spoken with the telephone exchange name [1]. When I was small, I learned our phone number as “SYcamore 8 4 8 9 7” or “S Y 8 4 8 9 7.” We thought of the first two digits as letters, not as numbers.Second postscript: I lost contact with that prime-factoring friend after high school. I see now that she went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, specialized in number theory, and had an Erdős number of 1. In 1985, she published a paper titled “How Often Is the Number of Divisors of n a Divisor of n?” [2]. She died two years ago, at the age of sixty-six [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange_names[2] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022314X85...[3] https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/claudia...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belphegor%27s_prime"666" with 13 0's on either side and 1's on the ends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42748691</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built an Excel Add-In that allows my girlfriend to quickly filter 7000 paper titles and abstracts for a review paper that she is writing [1]. It uses Gemma 2 2b which is a wonderful little model that can run on her laptop CPU. It works surprisingly well for this kind of binary classification task.The nice thing is that she can copy/paste the titles and abstracts in to two columns and write e.g. "=PROMPT(A1:B1, "If the paper studies diabetic neuropathy and stroke, return 'Include', otherwise return 'Exclude'")" and then drag down the formula across 7000 rows to bulk process the data on her own because it's just Excel. There is a gif on the readme on the Github repo that shows it.[1] https://github.com/getcellm/cellm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have ollama responding to SMS spam texts.  I told it to feign interest in whatever the spammer is selling/buying.  Each number gets its own persona, like a millennial gymbro or 19th century British gentleman.http://files.widloski.com/image10%20(1).pnghttp://files.widloski.com/image11.png&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using Llama models to identify cookie notices on websites, for the purpose of adding filter rules to block them in EasyList Cookie. Otherwise, this is normally done by, essentially, manual volunteer reporting.Most cookie notices turn out to be pretty similar, HTML/CSS-wise, and then you can grab their `innerText` and filter out false positives with a small LLM. I've found the 3B models have decent performance on this task, given enough prompt engineering. They do fall apart slightly around edge cases like less common languages or combined cookie notice + age restriction banners. 7B has a negligible false-positive rate without much extra cost. Either way these things are really fast and it's amazing to see reports streaming in during a crawl with no human effort required.Code is at https://github.com/brave/cookiemonster. You can see the prompt at https://github.com/brave/cookiemonster/blob/main/src/text-cl....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784365</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This stands to reason. If you need the answer to a question, and you can either get it directly, or spend time researching the answer, you're going to learn much more with the latter approach than the former.
You may be disciplined enough to do more research if the answer is directly presented to you, but most people will not do that, and most companies are not interested in that, they want quick 'efficient', 'competitive' solutions. They aren't considering the long term downside to this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two aspects to this from my pov. And I think it might be controversial.When i have a question about any topic, and I ask Chatgpt, i usually chat about more things, coming up with questions based on the answer, and mostly stupid questions. I feel like I am taking in the information, analyzing, and then diving deeper because I am curious. This is based on how I learn about stuff. I know i need to check a few things, and that it's not fully accurate, but the conversation flows in a direction I like.compared this to researching on the internet, there are some good aspects, but more often than not, I end up reading an opinionated post by someone (no matter the topic, if you go deep enough, you will land on an opinionated factual telling). That feels like someone decided what questions are important, what angles we need to look at, and what the conclusion should be. Yes, it is educational, but I am always left with lingering questions.The difference is curiosity. If people are curious about a topic, they will learn. If not, they are happy with the answer. And that is not laziness. You cannot be curious about everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been calling this out since OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT.The danger in ubiquitously available LLMs, which seemingly have an answer to any question, isn’t necessarily their existence.The real danger lies in their seductive nature - over how tempting it becomes to immediately reach for the nearest LLM to provide an answer rather than taking a few moments to quietly ponder the problem on your own. That act of manipulating the problem in your head—critical thinking—is ultimately a craft. And the only way to become better at it is by practicing it in a deliberate, disciplined fashion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780022</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;move our local communities off Facebook and onto our own platform. Is there a off-the-shelf solutionTo get better answers, you need to flesh out all the features of Facebook that your communities are using.  E.g. Shared event calendars?  Groups?  Private Messaging?  Video hosting for users to upload vids of community events? Live feeds?  Etc.Look at the left side of navigation topics to help you enumerate and think about it:
https://www.facebook.com/help/130979416980121/Do you expect those ~50k to create new logins for the new platform? Or do they sign in with their existing "Facebook ID" to avoid hassle of new account creation?  Do they need a phone app?  If it's website only from the smartphone web browser, do you need web push for notifications?  Facebook interaction with others has convenient lookup from the phones' contact listing.  Web-only site doesn't have straightforward access to smartphone's address book (without PhoneGap).  Etc.If your communities are using a lot of those social networking features, it means trying to use Mastodon as a substitute for Facebook is going to be a very incomplete solution.Of course, alternative solutions are not going to fully match Facebook but you still need to think of the threshold for a minimum viable feature set so your 50k users won't reject it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I live in a more rural community (moved from a big city). We have 5-6 small (~50k people) towns, all well connected. Everything happens on Facebook. I would like to move to a different platforms. Plus points for self-hosted, federated.Do YOU want to move off of Facebook for some reason, or do people want to move off of Facebook for some reason. MOST people in the US, especially in a rural are are not going to quit an app because say the CEO of a company is friendly to the President. You have an uphill battle, and at best you are going to shed a majority of users. Facebook is a popular platform, especially for those 30+ people in a small town that use local groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Disclaimer: I've never tried to move large numbers of people off of Facebook; I have organized community groups from scratch before, and I have led initiatives at work that consisted largely of convincing people to do a thing.  Much of this advice is from that perspective.  YMMV.)So: my advice is to not think of it as all-or-nothing.  You will not be able to move 300k people off of Facebook overnight.  This is somewhat akin to every IT migration project ever: it always takes longer than you think, and is not always a linear process from "fewer people migrated" to "more people migrated".It's also akin to community organizing: there is no substitute for actually talking to people about it, especially in the initial phases.  Or: high-touch sales, where you may initially need to spend a lot of energy and time per person successfully moved over.  The other common thing here is that you will hear "no" a lot, which is a valuable experience anyways (but will be frustrating).Also: unfortunately, no one will care if it's self-hosted or federated, outside of niche tech circles.  They will care about whether they can reach the people they want to reach, and whether the user experience is good or not.  This is reality: talking about these points will not help you.Some things you'll probably need to do:- Identify a single credible alternative platform. 
- Identify specific groups of people who are willing to be early "de-adopters".  For instance: a local youth group, a sports club, whatever.  Ideally you are a part of this group already; you then have a much better chance.  Businesses will likely say no, so you want community groups.
- Within those groups, identify champions: people who care about the same thing you care about, and are willing to commit time and effort to help.
- Together with your champions, build a toolkit that allows you to scale up your efforts.  This may be guides on how to talk to people about the change - what works, what doesn't.  This might be instructions for setting up a specific platform.  It might be communications channels, leaflets / flyers for putting up in public places, whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779776</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's journey to create "Guitaraoke," a project that allows musicians to easily play along with backing tracks by stripping vocals from songs. It begins with a focus on the technical aspects of using the Vamp plugin and ImageSharp to process audio and manipulate visuals. The author shares insights on handling audio chords and tracks, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying technologies like FFmpeg. The piece is the first part of a series, setting the stage for further exploration into music technology and its applications in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this is very nice, I hadn't seen it before. A few random thoughts:- The Vamp Plugin Pack for Mac finally got an ARM/Intel universal build in its 2.0 release last year, so hopefully the caveat mentioned about the M1 Mac should no longer apply- Most of the Vamp plugins in the Pack pre-date the pervasive use of deep learning in academia, and use classic AI or machine-learning methods with custom feature design and filtering/clustering/state models etc. (The associated papers can be an interesting read, because the methods are so explicitly tailored to the domain)- Audacity as host only supports plugins that emit time labels as output - this obviously includes beats and chords, but there are other forms of analysis plugins can do if the host (e.g. Sonic Visualiser) supports them- Besides the simple host in the Vamp SDK, there is another command-line Vamp host called Sonic Annotator (https://vamp-plugins.org/sonic-annotator/) which is  even harder to use, equally poorly documented, and even more poorly maintained, but capable of some quite powerful batch analysis and supporting a wider range of audio file formats. Worth checking out if you're curious(I'm the main author of the Vamp SDK and wrote bits of some of the plugins, so if you have other questions I may be able to help)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;any dylan beattie post must be accompanied with a recommendation for his hit single, You Give REST a Bad Namehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSKp2StlS6s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I’ve created 5-channel mixes of all the backing tracks so we can fade out specific instruments if somebody wants to play them liveHow was this done? This seems like an even more difficult task to do well than what’s described in the article&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738143</guid></item><item><title>15.

However, NFC recognition doesn’t always work as smoothly as one would hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious why the NFC tags are required at all?Can't you switch profiles on your phone without scanning an NFC tag already?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not the same idea, but the same category. You can Drag countries to different places on the Mercator projection to see how they warp and change size.Classic example is moving Greenland onto the US. Or Russia. Russia isn't talked about much in this case, but its dramatic how it changes.https://www.thetruesize.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this really a Mercator projection?  It doesn't appear to maintain the invariant that lines of constant bearing are straight lines.If I pick a point somewhere in the middle of Manhattan, the top point of Manhattan is somewhere near the top of the light colored area and the bottom point of Manhattan nearish the bottom of the light colored area.  This means that if I draw straight lines on the the map from San Francisco to these two points, the angle between them is something like 30 degrees.  They pass through very roughly the top and bottom of Nevada.  But there's no line of constant bearing that passes from SF through the top of Nevada to the top of Manhattan while at the same time one that passes through the bottom of Nevada to the bottom of Manhattan.This is all very wishy-washy, but it doesn't look right to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you search for "90,0" and then use the change orientation button to put the south pole on the bottom of the screen you can recover the more familiar distorted map.Other choices really do put into perspective how distorted this projection is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42783948</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've done research in this space for many years at Google AI and now at SnapCalorie. The thing I find interesting is how confident people are in their ability to estimate portion size visually, and in truth how wrong they all are.We published in CVPR (top peer reviewed academic conference for computer vision) and people are on average off by 53% and even trained professionals are still off by 40%. Basically if you want to have a higher level of accuracy you need to use a food scale or something that measure the volume of food, people just can't estimate portion sizes visually.Oils, cooking fats, hidden ingredients are what people are most concerned about but they actually add far less error to people's tracking than portion. Nutrition5k is the paper we published if you want to check out more details on the breakdown of error most people get when tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that "track and weight everything" (how ?) do you manage ?:- sauces you make yourself? I often mix some different oils, mustard, seeds, miso, bit of leamon juice and spices… but weighting and logging everything will take 3x the time to do the sauce itself- different cooking time in one receive : oignons going first, tomato sauce in the middle and parsley at the end (but still cook a bit with residual heat)- Leftovers nutrients decrease with time- counting how much you take of a meal shared with others, especially when you serves yourself multiple time- different species/cultivation methods like the rustic small and dense cucumber from your neighbor and the spongy one from the supermarket in JanuaryI have the feeling that might have been easy at some point in my life when I lived alone and mostly eat packaged food and raw vegetable that looked like clones but not when I share my meal, cook a lot more raw un-barcoded aliments and gained confidence to dose "by the eye" without recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people seem to have a purely emotional relationship with resources which logic doesn't seem to be able to penetrate. Food and finances seem similar here. For years I tried to get my wife to stick to a grocery budget. That is, we have $n per week for all groceries. She'd blow badly over the limit every time. "But we needed [food]" or "These were toiletries, so they don't _count_ as groceries." Ultimately we never had an real success sticking to a grocery budget, and ultimately the solution was me working towards better paying jobs.This feels a LOT like weight loss. Calories in --&gt; calories out is conceptually very simple, but in practice more people struggle with it than not. It certainly cannot be the case that they struggle with the concept; they struggle with actually putting it into action. Lying to themselves, twisting themselves into philosophical knots, and probably most often, conceding to their cravings. Food acquisition is one of out more basic drives, so it should probably be no surprise that people struggle to intellectualize it.(as and aside, there are also people who wrongly believe that calories in --&gt; calories out is a flawed concept because not all people have the same metabolism, or not all calories are equal. Both of these are true, but none of them actually negate the premise. For whatever your metabolism, and whatever your category of calories, fewer calories will still produce weight loss. It may feel unfair that someone doesn't have to work as hard as you to produce the same result, but this is actually true in all areas of life. Now that said, improving the quality of your calories is very important, and should not be ignored -- but it also does not negate the premise.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779147</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What fascinates me most is not the protocol itself, but the potential to add a thin scripting layer (similar to Redis' EVAL or the newer modules API) to enable complex logic with atomic transactions and high QPS.In the past, we relied heavily on using EVAL[SHA] with 200+ loc Lua scripts in order to implement high throughput, atomic transactions for realtime systems. We also used the JSON &amp; Redis Query Language (previous named "full-text search") to build a more maintainable &amp; strongly consistent system than using raw key-values and manually building secondary indexes.We’ve since migrated to a native FoundationDB and SQLite hybrid setup, but this approach would have been really helpful for early-stage prototyping with a higher performance ceiling (thanks to FDB sharding) than a single-node Redis with AOF.Related: Redis Cluster is a world of pain when handling clustering keys and cross-node queries and orchestration. DragonflyDB is chasing after the market of companies considering sharding Redis because of performance issues by providing better single-node performance. There's probably an alternative approach that could work by using an architecture like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The awesome thing about Redis is that it's less a "cache" and more a set of fast network-shared, generic data structures. To have that then also be transactional and durable would be really handy sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If only it wasn't Java.. but it looks very cool anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771403</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What's changed?Largely, the make up of the audience in HN. I sincerely doubt that the hard core of people doing startups, thinking of doing a startup, or just very interested in the topic has gone away or changed attitude very much.But the profile of HN has grown. It's a miracle that it's still an interesting and curious group, but from comments I'd be astounded if there were not a far greater proportion of people who are here because they are generically interested in tech topics and not specifically startups. That broader group was always there, of course, just its proportions relative to the hard core of entrepreneurs has changed.I'd love to see some objective analysis of how things changed after the twitter and reddit kerfuffles, but I don't believe the article's thesis that the zeitgeist is the cause.PS I could live without the stories that violate the precept of "If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic." ... but it's still pretty good here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd say starting a company to make something people want in order to sell it for money is still relevant. It's just that you're looking at working quietly, humbly, but perseverantly for the next 25 years, slowly growing the business and balancing the risks and opportunities along the way. You won't be looking for an "exit" because you want to take care of the company you built. That's a very different story from whatever vibe it is that startups acquired after the dotcom boom, i.e. find something that hasn't been done before, scales quickly, and sell the company after a few years for 1000x, and then something.That never was sustainable, I think, and effectively it became a glorified hiring process for big tech who bought the best toy companies to get to the people behind. And now even big tech figured it's cheaper to just hire the talent directly and not buy their token company for a few million first just to get the guys in.Not saying a good company with a good idea and execution at the right time couldn't still make it big quick: there always were some lucky ones and there will always be. But the process isn't repeatably stable enough that there's a lot of wasted effort to make a few shooting stars. And everybody seems to be slowly accepting that. Go for it if the opportunity arises but if you spend 10 years trying and trying without the fish biting you're likely better off saving off from a decent salary when those years have passed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO building startup became a status symbol which means that the payment in respect for making a courageous adventure is lost and commoditized. We are slowly seeing the same for academia.Point 2 resonates with me. Risk adjusted it is very unlikely that one will make a reasonable salary doing startups. So it is conviction and heart that needs to drive it.For me, the main issue is that every time I voice the idea about building something I get bombarded with premature growth and commercialization concerns instead of excitement about how to solve the problem. I think this is endemic - the entire sector is short sighted and profit obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42778266</guid></item><item><title>20.

Anyways, I stumbled on some of Rafael's drawings and found their inclusion of the guide lines / measuring lines invaluable, but for the hell of it, I emailed him some questions.
He promptly responded and then dumped images and reference material on dropbox for me - very nice guy.Personal fav is "Dürer" that demonstrates Albrecht Dürers method of projecting a spiral.https://www.rafael-araujo.com/product-page/d%C3%BCrer#&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first glance the "masterpieces" looked like a crap ton of lines and circles around a sketched shell or butterfly. You know, the kind you see when you tell Stable Diffusion to "sketch". Then I watched the video for a sec... WOAH!!! He is talking about a "formula" quite a bit... ctrl-f "formula" == 0 results.Google: Rafael Araujo artist formula. Ahhhh! https://www.rafael-araujo.com/calculationNow we are getting somewhere... and another that shows the process a bit better: https://hazelhomeartandantiques.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-cal...Now I am trawling github to see if I can find some processing or similar libraries that I can play around with.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A researcher gave a presentation on this topic a few years ago, "It's Sirius O'Clock: Astronomical Timekeeping in Ancient Egypt":&gt; Ever wondered how the Ancient Egyptians kept time? Well, Dr. Sarah Symons from McMaster University wondered about this, too.  With the help of some of her colleagues, she participated in a research project to find out how they managed time. On April 10, 2019, she presented some of her findings at the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada - Toronto Centre's Speaker's Night. The meeting was held at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto Canada.* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak07dI-TALU* https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/symonss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than a thousand years after these Middle Kingdom coffin lids, highly engineered mechanical star trackers (astrolabes) were used to calculate the time at night.Here’s a letter accompanying the gift of a gold and silver astrolabe from the Lybian philosopher Synesius to a Byzantine general. Interestingly, it shows that Hypatia of Alexandria contributed to the design of Synesius’ Astrolabe. It further indicates that Astrolabes could be used as “night clocks” and as instruments of philosophical investigation. https://www.livius.org/sources/content/synesius/synesius-on-...“I am therefore offering you a gift most befitting for me to give, and for you to receive. It is a work of my own devising, including all that she, my most reverend teacher [Hypatia], helped to contribute, and it was executed by the best hand to be found in our country in the art of the silversmiths”The letter also discusses how much geometry and astronomy had progressed since the time of Ptolemy. Hypatia’s father, Theon of Alexandria, had recently published “Euclid’s Elements of Geometry,” the most successful and influential geometry textbook of all time. I’ll note that this work was almost certainly produced with the help of his mathematical genius daughter, even if she wasn’t formally credited.But nice to see Synesius credit her so directly here, in the production of this mechanical star computer (as I believe an astrolabe has right to be called).And, while he did not credit the Egyptians, he credits the beginnings of the Greek philosophical knowledge of the stars to Pythagoras (who is claimed by Iamblichus to have become an Egyptian priest).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't mention north stars at all sadly.While we all (should) know that the Earth rotates on its axis, not as many people know that the axis is 'wobbly', kind of like a children's top as it slows down a bit. So a line that goes through the North and South Poles points differently over time: currently it points roughly to Polaris, but go back a while—e.g., Ancient Egypt—and it pointed to Thuban (and other starts between then and now):* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThubanSee also two related stars for the Egyptians:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IndestructiblesThe current idea is that they used those star(s) to align the pyramids:* https://www.astronomy.com/science/are-the-egyptian-pyramids-...* https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/thuban-past-north-star/* https://www.science.org/content/article/stars-date-egyptian-...If anyone is traveling/visiting the Western US, and can drop by the Hoover Dam, a similar astronomical design element is present:&gt; On the western flank of the Hoover Dam stands a little-understood monument, commissioned by the US Bureau of Reclamation when construction of the dam began in 01931. The most noticeable parts of this corner of the dam, now known as Monument Plaza, are the massive winged bronze sculptures and central flagpole which are often photographed by visitors. The most amazing feature of this plaza, however, is under their feet as they take those pictures.&gt; The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth.* https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/the-26-000-year-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42774228</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of "concept cells," specialized neurons in the brain that are thought to play a crucial role in abstracting information and forming memories. Researchers have discovered that these cells activate in response to specific ideas or concepts, allowing us to associate different experiences and knowledge into cohesive memories. The understanding of concept cells advances our knowledge of memory formation and retrieval processes, potentially leading to insights into memory-related disorders. The findings emphasize the brain's remarkable ability to generalize information from specific experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question related to 3D mesh models in general: has any significant work been done on models oriented towards photogrammetry?Case in point, I have a series of photos (48) that capture a small statue. The photos are high quality, the object was on a rotating platform. Lighting is consistent. The background is solid black.These normally are ideal variables for photogrammetry but none of the various common applications and websites do a very good job creating a mesh out of it that isn't super low poly and/or full of holes.I've been casually scanning huggingface for relevant models to try out but haven't really found anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative AI is going to drive the marginal cost of building 3D interactive content to zero. Unironically this will unlock the metaverse, cringe as that may sound. I'm more bullish than ever on AR/VR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the AI un-initiated; is this something you could feasibly run at home? eg on a 4090? (How can I tell how "big" the model is from the github or huggingface page?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42786040</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note about GitHub Windows Actions runners: I think I understand what is wrong with them, though it's somewhat conjecture since I don't actually know how it works internally.It looks like the free CI runners have C: drive pointing to a disk that is restored from a snapshot, but often times it hasn't finished restoring the entire snapshot by the time your workflow runs, so IO can be very slow, even if you don't need to read from the still-frozen parts of the disk. Some software ran inside workflows will do heavy R/W on C: drive, but it's better to move anything that will be written to disk, e.g. caches, to D: if possible. This often leads to much better performance with I/O and more predictable runtimes, particularly when there isn't a lot of actual compute to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tale as old as time;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see the value in this, but I don't get why it needs to be a SaaS. Don't get me wrong; a revenue stream for something this obviously useful is great! But why not just make it dual licensing; non-commercial projects get it under AGPL or some custom license that prevents them from using it commercially. Everyone else gets a bog-standard yearly license or such... Why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great idea, and it looks like you've done a great job!  I share your enthusiasm for these printers.  I have a Rongta receipt printer sitting on my desk that I like to play with :-)I have a business usecase for something like this (now that Chrome doesn't allow printing to ESC/POS), and exposing the printer interface as an HTTP API is a clever and great solution!  But, sending the data through a third party is a complete no-go for us for reasons of compliance.  For this architecture to work for us we would have to host it on our VPN and serve it from our own domain as our customers have a strict whitelist.As cool an idea as this is, honestly though I don't think this should be a SaaS.  Certainly it doesn't fit the typical mold of SaaS where there's nothing to install because it's all delivered through the web.  Given you have to install a local Pi or other, you lose all the benefits of SaaS and also incur all the downsides of SaaS.  It feels like it was shoehorned into a SaaS because otherwise it would be very hard to monetize.  I don't blame you for that because it is indeed a hard problem to figure out how to get paid (in fact I've abandoned good ideas prevously because it was either SaaSify something that shouldn't be a SaaS or else face huge obstacles getting paid), but I wanted to share my thoughts honestly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, the question is: Can it print with a Cat Printer?You know, the cheap toy-like printers? Like this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Portable-Instant-Bluetooth-Wireless...I was trying to hack mine to use it with an app I want to create for personal use. Currently only prints using the official Fun Print app over a bluetooth connection.There are projects[0]that are supposed to work with a cat printer but mine specifically isn’t. It identifies itself as “MXW01” , which is different that the printers tested.[0]

Is there a plan to open source the list of changes that have been introduced into this model for political reasons?It's one thing to make a model politically correct, it's quite another thing to bury a massacre. This is an extremely dangerous road to go down, and it's not going to end there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the R1 paper, if the benchmark are correct, even the 1.5b and 7b models are outperforming Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and you can run these models on a 8-16GB macbook, that's insane...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is wrong, only the distilled models from llama, qwen are on ollama, not the actual official MoE r1 model from deepseekv3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772983</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, these are beautiful. My dad used to make these as a sort of hobby (he liked any excuse to hop on the lathe, and they made great gifts; you don't realize how awful the ones in big box stores are until someone makes you a proper one). He'll love to see this.It didn't occur to me that there'd be such an extensive collection of something seemingly so obscure, yet here we are. It seems like this exists for everything out there.It's very nostalgic in a way. Though my dad's were different, the dark, solid wood and geometric shapes bring me back to my childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These are handsome, but my real question is: how's the mechanism? Of the half dozen or so pepper mills I've owned, half of them kind of sucked from the get-go (the current one grinds ok, but doesn't feed fresh peppercorns without a regular shake), and the other half broke in a couple years (the last one the adjustment mechanism jammed up). I don't feel like I'm an unreasonably aggressive pepper grinder, nor do I think I use an abnormally large amount of pepper.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just built a library on jReleaser!https://github.com/NJAldwin/maven-central-testI wanted to release a jvm lib on Maven Central -- which no longer requires opening a jira ticket for a new package!  Instead, simple DNS TXT verification is all that's needed.  However, the caveat is that it's the new Maven Central service, which doesn't have as much support in build tools as the older sonatype one.  jReleaser is one of the few tools which supports it.So I hacked together a fully self-contained minimally reproducible example of a Gradle library, built and published in GitHub using jReleaser.There were several things that had me scratching my head with jReleaser, and the docs are strangely organized IMO (it comes from supporting so many facets, I believe), but it ended up working well enough!I ended up adding a doc build and some other stuff to the repo too.  Now I have a full example that I can use to trivially publish new libraries (such as in-progress https://github.com/NJAldwin/ambient-consumer ).(Why Maven Central?  Since the demise of jFrog/jCenter/BinTray, there's not been an easy way to widely publish jvm libraries.  At work I've used GH packages, but that requires a GitHub login even for public packages, which is a significant barrier IME.  JitPack is one option, but it does on-demand builds linked closely to the origin repo, whereas I wanted the classic immutable build published on release.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very nice to see JReleaser here on HN! I'm very happy with it, using it for publishing releases of kcctl (a command line client for Kafka Connect written in Java, compiled and published as native binaries for Linux/MacOS/Win via GraalVM). Here's the config, in case folks are looking for an example: https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl/blob/main/pom.xml#L430-L530. Releases are triggered by running a parameterized workflow (taking the version to be released) on GitHub Actions.A big shout-out to Andres Almiray, the maintainer of JReleaser, who has always been super-fast to answer any questions and help to sort out issues when I ran into them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it somehow related to GoReleaser? I saw GoReleaser supports multiple languages now as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784880</guid></item><item><title>29.

This seems production ready for smaller shops where it's feasible for developers to sign artifacts individually. For a system where you'd want CI to publish artifacts, and then use the k8s policy controller to only run verified artifacts, it seems incomplete.It appears the reason to include this system in a toolchain would be to meet compliance requirements, but even the GCP, AWS, and Azure implementations of artifact signing &amp; verification are in beta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somewhat adjacent question: are there people working on ways to verify that a particular server or API backend are running the specific signed release that is open sourced? Can a company somehow cryptographically prove to its users that the running build is derived from the source unmodified?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSR supports sigstore https://jsr.io/docs/trust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784892</guid></item><item><title>30.

The black circle is the ball; you roll the dice to determine the amount of moves2. after the dice roll, the allowed moves will be shown - as yellow squares near the ball; this is a very faint yellow and easy to miss3. to move the ball, roll the dice then click on the faint yellow squares near the ball (or further away if you rolled a 6).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42746752</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the historical context and evolution of sex education, particularly focusing on the Regency era in Britain. It highlights how attitudes toward sexuality were shaped by various cultural, medical, and social factors, and examines the implications of these views on contemporary sex education. The piece argues that understanding past perspectives on sexuality can inform current discussions and approaches to educating young people about sexual health and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

The author talk a lot about "sexual books" of the times, but you will certainly not find the "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" (Fanny Hill) in the hand of a proper young woman.
(this stuff where costly rarities for men too).It was far more simpler than this, no need for books.Every rural girls and boys, and women and men living in a city did know, without any books,
what there is to know simply by looking at the animals in the farms
or the horses and dogs in the streets.There was also the "education" at the wash-houses... The hubs to know everything there is to now at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article is --per usual-- not warranting the scope of the title. A more accurate title would be: Some literature possibly used in educating aristocratic English women about sex. The subtitle then would be: while simultaneously plugging my own book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely fascinating. The deep history of obvious knowledge of reproduction side by side with astounding ignorance is palpable. Joseph Heller wrote about it in catch-22 and a parade of modern day unexpected pregnancy stories are testament to it's continuance.What's equally fascinating is the equally dichotomous side by side knowledge of STDs and their effect on pregnancy. You get a lot of it in "who do you think you are" ancestry type shows, when there is the massive family lots of children dead quickly story.I do love a good bodice ripper. Dorothy Dunnett was my stand out historian author, maybe I have a (-substantially more fruity) alternative to explore.(Bridgerton was fun but I find Georgette Heyer just as fun, and you can't beat her on the peninsular wars or Waterloo alongside the heaving bosoms)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42739597</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being new to python, the astral stuff is such a relief.I don’t think experienced python folks realize how much the flexible tooling slows people down, and creates friction for adopters. Setting up my project I tried 3 environment managers, 2 type checkers, 3 formatters/linters, 3 packagers/dependancy/project managers.I know this is kinda the n+1 issue where astral is just adding another. But it feels like a complete and well designed stack, not a box of parts encouraging me to build my own. Reminds me a bit of go tooling.I am a convert. I’ll happily jump on their type checker and packager when ready.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a little sad that Ruff took off as a re-implementation of a whole bunch of work that was already done, rather than as a project to improve the work that was already done.It was nice to be able to write little extra linters or flake8 plugins in the language I was linting. Plus decades of effort had gone into making those plugins pretty great, finding the right separation of linting codes so that the right things could be linted/ignored per codebase.I understand why they did it, and they have done it remarkably well, but "rewrite it from scratch" is almost never the best answer and part of me wonders if this result could have been even better achieved another way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very impressed by the recent developer experience improvements in the python ecosystem. Between ruff, uv, and https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach we'll be able to keep our django monolith going for a long time.Any opinions about the current state of the art type checker?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42775029</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the frustrations of couriers who are increasingly reliant on algorithms to manage their deliveries, which they find perplexing and often unfair. Couriers express concerns about the lack of transparency in how these algorithms operate, leading to unpredictable work conditions, income instability, and feelings of being dehumanized. Despite the technological advancements intended to optimize logistics, many couriers feel that the algorithms prioritize efficiency over their wellbeing, creating a challenging work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

People are accused of fraud, and have their access withdrawn - but nobody will explain what they allegedly did, because that would leak information about the fraud detection.It's a kind of automated low trust economy. The drivers don't trust the apps, and the app doesn't trust the drivers, so the thing has to be held together by surveillance and micromanagement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is room for a food delivery horror game.

The red dot on the flag of Japan was off center by 1/100 towards the pole before 1999.
The naval flag of France is not of equal proportions. the proportion are; blue 30, white 33, and red 37&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes turtle graphics are very educational, I taught it (via PyTurtle) to 11-year-olds, who picked it up easily ("draw a house, then translate into instructions for the little turtle").BTW, there is no "Western European Union" any more, just one European Union, so the now simplified flag can leave out the white ugly letters in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm in awe that in 2024 the first introduction to programming can be a turtle in Python, just like it was in 1982 when someone came to my primary school to show everyone a turtle in Logo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772911</guid></item><item><title>36.

The article doesn’t explain how that makes it respond to sunlight, which is what their demonstration system does. I didn’t think sunlight and humidity were always correlated. Am I missing something obvious?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder why they went with that shape, surely it's possible to design anything if you start from the principle that some materials expand when moist and contract when dry.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of the `context` package in Go programming, arguing that it can lead to complications in code readability and maintainability. The author advocates for a simplified approach, suggesting that the use of `context` should be minimized or eliminated in favor of more explicit handling of dependencies and parameters.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is about an explicit argument of type "Context". I'm not a Go user, and at first I thought it was about something else: an implicit context variable that allows you to pass stuff deep down the call stack, without intermediate functions knowing about it.React has "Context", SwiftUI has "@Environment", Emacs LISP has dynamic scope (so I heard). C# has AsyncLocal, Node.JS AsyncLocalStorage.This is one of those ideas that at first seem really wrong (isn't it just a global variable in disguise?) but is actually very useful and can result in cleaner code with less globals or less superfluous function arguments. Imagine passing a logger like this, or feature flags. Or imagine setting "debug = True" before a function, and it applies to everything down the call stack (but not in other threads/async contexts).Implicit context (properly integrated into the type system) is something I would consider in any new language. And it might also be a solution here (altough I would say such a "clever" and unusual feature would be against the goals of Go).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you use ctx.Value in my (non-existent) company, you’re firedThis is such a bad take.ctx.Value is incredibly useful for passing around context of api calls. We use it a lot, especially for logging such context values as locales, ids, client info, etc. We then use these context values when calling other services as headers so they gain the context around the original call too. Loggers in all services pluck out values from the context automatically when a log entry is created. It's a fantastic system and serves us well. e.g.    log.WithContext(ctx).Errorf("....", err)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is from 2017!As others have already mentioned, there won't be a Go 2. Besides, I really don't want another verbose method for cancellation; error handling is already bad enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777625</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article. My partner bought an Apple watch a couple of years ago and I was shocked at what a poor value proposition it was. Very expensive and wouldn't even hold a charge for a day. I guess you get used to it but having to charge my watch every day would drive me mad. Obviously there are things it will do better than a Garmin (and things it can do that a Garmin simply can't) but overall it didn't make sense to me as a product (or, evidently, to my partner, who now leaves it gathering dust).I do think Garmin have found a really good balance for their devices in being smart but not "too smart". I have had a Vívoactive 3 for years that I am pretty happy with. Good battery life and does all the basic fitness stuff plus some actually useful extras like alerting me to phone notifications, etc.Also interesting is that the phone never just replaced standalone GPS fitness trackers. It's entirely possible to just use your phone to track your run, though obviously there are downsides, like you don't get heart rate tracking and it's a lot bulkier (though I think most people probably run with their phone anyway).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a Garmin Descent Mk2i which I use for scuba diving, and it's a fabulous all-purpose fitness and adventure watch. I've used to for hundreds of dives, navigation on  multiple backpacking trips, cycling, and tons of other stuff. I even wear it daily, and it nicely supports notifications from my phone.When Garmin originally launched a scuba watch, I was kind of surprised. It's a small market, and there were a lot of established "good enough" players in the space. Everyone already had a dive computer. Who would want an expensive one from Garmin when they could buy an expensive one from Shearwater? But Garmin showed up with a good product, iterated by adding their sonar based SubWave for air integration, and eventually took a lot of marketshare by including fitness and smartwatch features the competitors lacked. Now I see tons of Garmins on dive boats. People love them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, let's review:1) build headquarters in (relatively) low COL city - in this case, Olathe KS, which is a suburb of Kansas City MO.2) Have people who actually want to make a product instead of making analysts happy3) Invest in R&amp;D4) Bring manufacturing in-house and tightly control processesIt's like everything the people actually doing the work at tech companies have been saying for years.Can I have my $10mil/year pay package now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752299</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the reverse engineering of the Pentium microprocessor, particularly focusing on its BiCMOS (Bipolar-CMOS) technology, which combines both bipolar and CMOS transistors. It outlines the process of analyzing the chip's architecture, including the layout and functionality of various components like its ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) and caches. The author discusses the significance of this reverse engineering effort in understanding historical computing technology and emphasizes the challenges encountered during the process. The piece also reflects on the implications of such work for future innovations in the field of microprocessor design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah, memories.  I was a manufacturing engineer in a bipolar factory from 1989 to 1992, and BiCMOS was the perennial hope for a future for our acquired skills.  When word broke that the Pentium would have one, it seemed significant.  On the whole, though, it didn't have the impact that was hoped for; bipolar hangs on (like COBOL) in certain niches, but I think despite the theoretical advantages, the disadvantages of having to think about both bipolar and CMOS transistors in the engineering, was too much of a price to pay.Lesser known reasons: as bipolar transistors went to polysilicon gates (which have a tiny, ~1-2 Angstrom thick layer of oxide in them) and MOS transistors started to become leakier through their ever-shrinking gate oxides, the distinction between MOS and bipolar transistors became fuzzier.  Modern MOS transistors leak less current through their gate oxides than the bipolar transistors did through the polysilicon emitter, but the physics of the two is not as different as it was twenty years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is BiCMOS radical woke? :-)

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and implications of the "uname" command in Unix-like operating systems, which provides essential information about the system's architecture, hostname, and operating system. It explains the different options available with the command and how it can be used for system identification and monitoring. The author emphasizes its utility for both system administrators and users, highlighting practical examples and potential applications in various scenarios. Overall, the piece serves as a guide to understanding and effectively utilizing the "uname" command in a Unix environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had recently run into an embedded problem where when switching the order of two functions in the source code, one of them would refuse to work. I tried a number of things without identifying the real error, and finally had to add a comment warning any later parties not to do this.
I even checked the assembly and they seem to be consistent. But when I upload to firmware, the error keeps coming back over and over again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a number of edge cases in embedded where static variables can become unreliable. I am not saying it is common exactly but it is certainly not unheard of. I usually keep it in my list of things to check when stuff is mysteriously going wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bugs like these are fun to read about, but never fun to debug if you need to get something else done. Nice writeup by Lup Yuen Lee once again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42751785</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The "Unconventional Adventures" page highlights unique travel experiences that break away from traditional tourism. It emphasizes the thrill of exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations, engaging in unusual activities, and embracing local cultures. The content encourages readers to seek out extraordinary adventures that offer a deeper connection to the places and people they encounter, ultimately promoting a sense of exploration and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look up Beau Miles on YouTube for more in this vein of unconventional adventures.Personally, I am a fan of exploring local waterways in the smallest, simplest boat you can find. The smaller the boat, the bigger the adventure. I recently built a folding 6 foot sailboat that I can sail with my young kid to a “distant shore” and pack up and carry home via public transport or Uber when we get there. Learning to build a boat- and traveling all around to find the right wood and materials was itself a great adventure.Ultimately, being the first to do something only matters for recognition, something people are too obsessed with nowadays. It is just as fun to do something you’ve never done before as something never at all done before- either way it’s new to you! Don’t tell anyone about it, don’t make it a social media spectacle, just do it for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do a small version of this in my own town. We're surrounded by public land, and I find stuff in the lidar data that looks interesting. And then I head out cross country through the forest to try to figure out what it is. Stumble across all kinds of weird stuff along the way. I love it even though I think most people would find it boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This speaks to me!In 2015, a friend and I resolved to ride our bicycles across Japan. I had felt the yearn to go on an adventure that engaged my whole body and encouraged exploration in an environment completely new to me. I deeply desired some version of crossing Middle Earth, and a bike ride with a start and end point but no plan in between felt like just the thing.In April of 2016 we set off from Kagoshima, and a few weeks later we ended our trip in Osaka. We made it roughly a third as far as we had wanted, but it’s a trip we’ll never forget, and one that we desperately want to continue someday. It scratched an itch I didn’t know how else I could scratch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767908</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu Theorem states that the excess demand curve for a market economy of rational agents can take the shape of any function, subject only to three fairly general conditions: the function must be continuous, must be homogeneous of degree zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function), and must satisfy Walras's law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walras%27s_law).Inconveniently for all economic theories, the implication of this mathematical proof is that excess demand and supply curves can take any shape that meets those three  conditions. The nicely sloped supply and demand curves we've all been shown in Economics textbooks are basically figments of economists' imaginations.Moreover, the textbook supply-demand curves we've always been shown are for only one good. The curves for all goods in a market economy are high-dimensional.High-dimensional supply and demand curves can have multiple equilibrium points, and there is no guarantee that those points will be optimal or even good.In other words, for a long time we've had proof -- proof! -- that "free markets" are not guaranteed to converge toward good outcomes.Markets can get stuck in crappy equilibria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't know anything about this and found the article hard to understand at first, but thankfully the Wikipedia articles on the subject are pretty okay: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenschein%E2%80%93Mantel%E2...The very abbreviated TL;DR of this post is:1. We are taught that markets look like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Supply-d...2. By applying rigorous math ("general equilibrium theory"), it turns out that there is no reason that markets can't look like this instead: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/SMD_Dema...3. OP's article summarizes how economists have reacted to this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the nicely sloped supply and demand curves are economic equivalent of spherical cows and as much as we shouldn't design a milk industry around spherical cows, we shouldn't design an economy around a nicely sloped supply and demand curves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752637</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth analysis of the differences between the "unlink" and "del" commands in Redis, highlighting their internal mechanisms and performance implications. It explains that while both commands are used to remove keys from the database, "del" immediately deletes the key and blocks other operations during the process, potentially leading to performance issues in high-load scenarios. In contrast, "unlink" performs the deletion asynchronously, allowing the system to handle other operations concurrently, which can enhance performance. The article includes examples and scenarios to illustrate the practical applications and benefits of using each command effectively within Redis environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in the context of Christian apologetics, weighing their potential benefits and drawbacks. It explores how LLMs can aid in generating responses to theological questions and engaging with different perspectives, but raises concerns about the accuracy of information, the loss of human nuance, and the risk of relying too heavily on technology in spiritual discussions. Ultimately, the author emphasizes a balanced approach that incorporates LLMs as tools while maintaining the importance of human discernment and theological rigor in apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I've seen all the points made in the article (besides some that wouldn't work outside of this particular religious context), they are well laid out and highlight not only the technological limitations, but also the moral implications of building a llm product.Moral issues that are not limited to religion, I've had conversations with a friend where I was trying to explain to them that their llm website idea will, with certainty, mislead people at some point. I think the exact idea was to build a gpt-based trip planner. I'd hate to have someone spend time and money on hotel, transportations, etc... To end up stranded in the middle of nowhere.Anyway, the article came out 4 months ago and the chatbox is still there.&gt; Which programming language would allow me to get closer to God?&gt; If I had to choose a programming language that reflects some aspect of God's nature, I would say that a language with a strong emphasis on order, logic, and beauty, such as Python, could be seen as a reflection of God's character. The Bible says, "God is not a God of disorder but of peace" (1 Corinthians 14:33, ESV), and Python's simplicity and readability can be seen as a reflection of this aspect of God's nature.At least we got that one out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was an interesting meditation on the limits of AI and how ordinary people don't see those limits, wrapped up in a context I normally wouldn't expect to see AI at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a Christian the only way I use LLMs is to ask for specific verses, which I then pull up on my Bibles to confirm. I don't expect an LLM to ever understand my theological views (Christian theology is like... programming languages, nobody likes anyone else's...), but if I ask it questions like "how many verses have x phrase" I have some semblance of trust that it might figure out enough to feed me such verses.I prefer to ask LLMs for starting points in research goals essentially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42781293</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decision of the OpenSSL project to not provide a QUIC API, stating that QUIC, a transport layer network protocol, is primarily managed in userspace rather than in system libraries. The author explains the implications of this decision for developers and the broader community, arguing that relying on a built-in API would not be beneficial as QUIC evolves and matures. Additionally, the post delves into the technical complexities of implementing QUIC and emphasizes the importance of keeping the OpenSSL library focused on its core objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note this is a blog post from 2021, which should be added to the title. The information included is out of date by several years now.OpenSSL has done stuff with QUIC since then, a cursory search turned up this README in their main repo on using QUIC and OpenSSL: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/README-QUIC.m...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an HTTP server author, this doesn't surprise me.We've ceded HTTP specification development to the big guys, and in so doing have made it more or less impossible to implement without resources on their scale. Have you looked at RFC 9000 et al? They're monstrously big, far larger than most independent shops could ever hope to economically pull off. The only way to comprehensively implement something of that scale is to have Google level resources to throw entire teams of engineers and years of focus at it.I've long said that any protocol worthy of being foundational should be reasonably implementable as a fourth-year term project. It doesn't have to be production ready or ergonomic or even generally useful, but if a group of fourth year CS students can't pull an end-to-end implementation together in a semester, the protocol is just too complex. It's not perfect, but it's as good of a yardstick as I've found.HTTP/1 passes this test easily; you can make a working version of it in about ninety seconds right in your terminal. HTTP/2 looks intimidating at first glance, but it's so much better specified than HTTP/1 that it's almost easier to get to a reasonable implementation. HTTP/3 on the other hand is...... well, weeks (if not months) of work  just to get a QUIC foundation working reasonably well enough that you could hope to start iterating on connections from a 'real' peer, and THEN you have to start on RFC 9114. Not to mention that the way it's structured you end up doing most of that work in the dark, hoping that you line everything up just so so that your first Hello World actually works. It's a way of working that is completely at odds with the hacker ethos that the best foundational protocols have in spades, and ends up looking and acting like what it is: a tool by the big guys, for the big guys. The rest of the internet need not apply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just recently apt listchanges informed me that "curl" (the binary) switched to gnuTLS to support HTTP3 (libcurl remained on openSSL for compatibility). So I assume this is still not fully resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777874</guid></item><item><title>48.

It looks like Dudeney (1917) predates these - the original source is his "Amusements in Mathematics" (https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16713/pg16713-images.ht...) and he poses there a different puzzle involving numbers on taxis.   I guess this is just a common source of integers appearing in one's environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because life is a cab array.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beside the problem.

I’ve got at least two family members that could probably be classified as hoarders.  They keep a bunch of stuff that they really should get rid of. But at least part of this is, I believe, ingrained upon them by their relatively impoverished upbringing. They would hang onto items of marginal value because that marginal value means more when you have to scrape by.Decluttering is a luxury. Rich people can throw out their rarely-used junk because it’s trivial for them to buy new stuff should the need arise. Poor people keep the “junk” because that little bit of potential residual value is a part of their livelihood.Most people should put their stack of National Geographics in the recycling bin, because it isn’t worth their time to find the person who’ll give them five bucks for it. For some people, that five bucks matters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742396</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article "We've Lost Our Respect for Complexity" explores the tendency in modern society to oversimplify complex issues and phenomena. It argues that this reductionist approach diminishes our understanding and appreciation of intricacies in various fields, such as science, culture, and technology. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing and engaging with complexity to foster deeper insights and more nuanced discussions, advocating for a shift back toward valuing thorough analysis over superficial conclusions. Additionally, the piece reflects on the societal implications of this trend, suggesting that embracing complexity can enhance critical thinking and informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing is, historically we never really had much respect for complexity.&gt; We talk about complex subjects all the time. Medicine, politics, economics, sociology, morality and moreFor our entire history we have being talking about complex subjects we barely understood and, like proud primates, we were always very vocal and cocksure about our view points.We experienced two cultural revolutions, first in the world of ancient Greece, subsequently in the modern era of scientific enlightenment. One can think of the emergent scientific method as effectively learning to respect complexity. Being humble about assertions that cannot be validated again and again, in different conditions, by different parties etc.The tangible result of this new trait (respecting complexity) was pretty amazing. But only for a precious few domains. Our default mode, being 100% sure about things we have little clue about (who needs hallucinating AI when you've got humans), continues to be the prevalent one.Whats worse, we now have what has been called "the pretence of knowledge" [1]. We know that real knowledge is powerful, so why not pretend we have it when we actually don't? This leads to a random mix of (typically self-serving) opinions coupled to the superficial use of scientific tools. A pathology most visible precisely in the above list of really complex topics.The risk is that as the challenges of our own complex societies mount, we will undo also what we have achieved, and effectively go back to become stochastic parrots, unhinged from complex reality.[1] https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/hay...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rise of complexity, and its collapse, defines every civilization for which we have historical records. Given that our society seem hell-bent on repeating the pattern, I question whether we ever had respect for it. It seems that we have nothing but arrogance to proclaim "this time we'll get it right" as we layer on the next layer of complexity.[1] Joseph Tainter "The Collapse of Complex Societies"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complexity has always been less respected the more it is separated from the experiences of the average person; or more personally, your own experiences. Unfortunately, that's the very nature of complexity itself. Dependencies increase instead of decrease in the hopes of scaling, saving time and money, or even providing a slightly better product. As positive as those efforts sound, they also make the failure cases worse.The only people to respect with regards to complexity are those dealing with inherent complexity -- especially when they're building more digestible abstractions, and those working to reduce complexity due to having a substantial understand of it. It can be rather difficult to distinguish between inherent complexity and incidental complexity though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777715</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The Twitter post highlights the story of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace, who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in facilitating illegal activities online. The post may emphasize calls for justice, discussions about the implications of his sentencing on internet freedom and privacy, and the broader societal impact of his case. It reflects ongoing debates about the ethical and legal considerations surrounding online marketplaces and digital freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangentially related: I had the disconcerting experience of reading a Wired article about his arrest[1] while unknowingly sitting about six feet from the spot where he was apprehended. When I read that the FBI agents had stopped at Bello Coffee while preparing their stakeout, I thought, huh, interesting coincidence, I just had a coffee there.Then Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me, and suddenly as I was reading I could look up and see exactly the chair he had been in, where the plainclothes police had positioned themselves, how they had arranged a distraction.Having this tableau unexpectedly unfold right in front of my eyes was a fascinating experience, and it certainly made the article suddenly get a lot more immersive![1] https://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/EDIT: to be clear, I was not present for the arrest. I was reading the magazine, some years after the arrest, but in the same place as the arrest. (I didn’t qualify the events with “I read that...” since I thought the narrative ellipsis would be obvious from context; evidently not.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel torn about this because it seems there was good evidence for attempted murder- and I cannot understand why they never tried him for that (seemingly larger) crime. However, for the crime he was actually found guilty of, the sentence was unfair and unreasonable. It seems they unethically sentenced him for crimes he was not even ever charged with.I'd also argue he almost certainly saved a huge number of lives with Silk Road: the ability to view eBay style feedback and chemical test results makes buying illegal drugs far safer than buying them on the street. On Silk Road people could buy from a reputable seller with a long history of providing unadulterated products, and could view testimonials from other buyers who had sent the products for chemical analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is wonderful. I've never argued that Ross shouldn't have served time but it's always been clear his prosecution and sentencing were excessive and unjust. The prosecutors asked for a 20 year sentence, which seemed disproportionate given the sentencing guidelines for a first-time offender and the non-violent charges he was convicted of. But the judge sentenced Ross to TWO life sentences plus 40 years - without the possibility of parole. There's no doubt Ross made a series of unwise and reckless decisions but serving over ten years of hard time in a FedMax prison is more than enough given the charges and his history.It's just unfortunate that Trump, and now, excessive pardons are politically polarized, which could cloud the fact that justice was done today. I don't credit Trump in any way for doing "the right thing" or even having a principled position regarding Ross' case. Clearly, others with influence on Trump convinced him to sign it. It doesn't matter how the pardon happened. Biden should have already pardoned Ross because that crazy sentence shouldn't have happened in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42786962</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant DNS error that affected Mastercard, which went unnoticed for several years. It explains how the issue could have led to the potential misdirection of customer traffic and data, posing security risks. The author highlights the importance of proper DNS management and monitoring, illustrating how even major companies can overlook critical vulnerabilities that may expose them to threats. The piece emphasizes the need for vigilance and robust security practices in the digital landscape to prevent such issues from occurring in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll chime in here as this is (very) related to my research.This instance of openly-registerable nameservers is just one (relatively rare) subset of a wide class of dangling DNS issues [1].Much more common is direct mapping of names to IP addresses on cloud providers that can be obtained by attackers [2][3]. Because of the scope and lack of global visibility that often comes with cloud services, an enterprise that uses is the cloud is very likely to have some vulnerabilitity like this under some subdomain.Unfortunately bug bounty programs often blanket exclude any form of "subdomain takeover" as a valid security threat, despite the fact that they're easily exploitable once discovered. We have internal (and public[4]) data showing all manner of sensitive information leaked as a result of this sort of configuration mismanagement.Ultimately, as others have observed, the current vulnerability disclosure landscape makes it far too easy for corporations to weasel out of acknowledging bona fide vulnerabilities, and of course ethical and legal expectations make it impossible for good-faith researchers to meet the bar of proof expected by these providers.To others' comments: yes, these vulnerabilities are trivially exploited to provision TLS certificates in practice, a risk that is unfortunately downplayed.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2976749.2978387

[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05122&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Bugcrowd portion of this story is not something I expected to see. The screenshot of the mail is apparently sent from the "Platform Behavior Standards Team," which means that either Bugcrowd are taking a rather expansive view of their platform standards [1] by attempting to police behaviour outside the platform, or Mastercard are impersonating official Bugcrowd staff.Neither option is particularly palatable.[1] https://www.bugcrowd.com/resources/hacker-resources/platform...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.Doesn't behavior like this mean that security researchers are more likely to intrude further next time -- at this company and others -- to gather more evidence of impact, expecting the company to lie about it otherwise?If you want some corporate spokesperson to be able to say "nothing to see here", shouldn't you reward the researcher amply enough that they're fine with the impact being downplayed?Then kinda going after the researcher in trying to suppress the news, after (AFAICT) the researcher already did the right thing...  Does the credit card company have a reason to do that?  Or is it more likely some misguided PR staff thinking that's their job?  Or some exec ultimately responsible for the infosec mistake, personally not wanting that embarrassment on their watch, and using company resources to try to suppress news of it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793783</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of successful abstractions in various fields, emphasizing their ability to simplify complex ideas and enhance understanding. It outlines key characteristics of effective abstractions, including clarity, relevance, and the balance between generality and specificity. The author argues that successful abstractions facilitate communication, promote creativity, and help individuals navigate complexities more efficiently. The piece ultimately highlights the importance of thoughtful abstraction in fostering innovation and problem-solving across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author's assertion is true - complexity has to live somewhere. The nuance, though, is that all places complexity can live are not created equal.Let's take the example of memory management: by pushing that complexity into the type system, Rust forces the programmer to deal with it and design around it. At the expense of some performance, we could instead push this complexity into a runtime garbage collection system. Since the runtime system understands things about the runtime characteristics of the program that can't be proven via static analysis, it can also handle more things without the programmer having to intervene, thus reducing the difficulty of the programming language. For most programmers this is a positive tradeoff (since most programmers are not writing software where every microsecond matters).Similar tradeoffs exist in many different areas of software engineering. One monolith, where all the information is in one place, is easier to write code in than two microservices, which keep having to ask each other questions via API call. Yet, sometimes we need microservices. Rendering your web application entirely on the frontend in React, or entirely on the backend with templates, where all the logic lives in one place, is much easier than doing server-sided rendering then hydrating on the frontend. Yet, sometimes we need server-sided rendering and hydration.Complexity is an irreducible constant, yes, but cognitive load is not. Cognitive load can increase or decrease depending on where you choose to push your complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not think of complexity as one thing. Abstractions are about both hiding and exposing complexity at the same time. Different levels of abstractions can expose or isolate different part of complexity. Exposing parts of it in a way that they become amenable to your tools is as important as isolating other parts somewhere in the background. Essentially, this has to do with how well a given abstraction choice maps into the structure of the problem-space and the relationships there. The choice of which parts of complexity you isolate and which you expose is important. You probably do not want to deal with everything at once, but also usually you cannot avoid dealing with something.The way I primarily see (and often like) type systems wrt complexity is as choosing which parts of complexity are important and exposing them (and rest being still there to deal with). There is a cognitive aspect to abstractions and complexity, irrespective even of IDEs, debuggers, compilers etc. I personally want my abstractions to make at least some sense in my head or a piece of paper in the way I think about the problem before even I start writing code. If the abstractions do not help me actually cognise about (some part of) the problem, they probably solve other problems, not mine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why Typescript/Python optional typing hit the best balance for me. Coding in duck-typed language is generally fine when your test suite is as fast and frequent as a type checker. That also explains why TDD is more popular in say Ruby or Python vs. Java. 
Speaking of Java, the problem with types is when you try to reify every single problem you encounter in your codebase.
By the way, python has structured types since 3.8, and I hope they get more popular in Python code:

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Tyranny of Structurelessness" by Jo Freeman discusses the concept of structurelessness in feminist and progressive organizations, arguing that the absence of formal structures can lead to hidden power dynamics and unequal distributions of authority. Freeman emphasizes that while such structures may be perceived as empowering, they often result in informal hierarchies that disadvantage some members, particularly women. The piece advocates for the establishment of clear structures and processes to ensure accountability and equitable participation, highlighting the importance of transparent decision-making to combat the underlying tyranny that can emerge in unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been part of a few "structureless" groups which spontaneously organized around an opportunity and were initially effective because of that structureless (e.g. somebody gets an idea,  the whole group moves like a military unit, opponents had no idea something like that could happen) but succumbed to the dynamics in that article on a time scale of three weeks (arguably ended a public company in that time!) to three years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend this essay often to people, especially in a start up. When someone describes their organization as being "flat", it's often a red flag because it means that there are unwritten power structure that newer employees will likely be excluded from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There should be a counterpart to this, "the tyranny of trying to encode an entire human mind in procedure."As well as, "the tyranny of pretending that rules are much more absolute than their authors." :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793483</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apps to fight apps has never worked for me. When I'm bored/tired enough, it becomes a game to disable my own restrictions.What works for me is removing the antecedent completely by charging my phone in another room at night.Now the battle is easier: Decide once a day to put it there, and track how many days you succeed.For me that's a lot easier than having it in my pocket, where the Internet is always a couple lazy taps away. Now I at least have to walk to it if I want it, and that often "breaks the spell."I finish work and chores hours earlier when my phone is charging in another room, without consciously doing anything else differently.It really makes me want a 1980s-style cellphone with no screen and big physical buttons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading on an e-ink device has kept me somewhat sane over the past 12 months.It's still very tempting to just "hop on reddit and see what's there" or "I'll just check bluesky for..." Then it's 2 hours later and you're angry and despondent.I've found that having no social media apps on my phone has helped. It also helps to stick to just Firefox+ublock on Android and resist every time a site tries to install an app.Try to steer clear of any sites with infinite scrolling and recognize the dark patterns that try to suck you in. One thing that was eye-opening was to visit reddit and see which of the stories in /r/all were "amygdala-bait"; rage, indignation, hate, fear, superiority, they're all bait on the hook to reel you in.People on reddit write fake stories that push as many buttons as possible; an obviously wrong/evil antagonist, the ridiculous situations that only get more and more extreme to try to attract notice, the righteous moral superiority over the antagonist and their minions, etc etc.Realizing that the result is the same, whether it's a fake story or "news", it's all amgydala-bait.I recommend getting a Library card and reading. Read anything you like, but read!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a big opportunity for someone to make a all encompassing blocker. I am yet to find one. I think everyone is struggling with this in some way.Anytime I get setup with a blocker it helps heaps. But I always slip back in. Every source of useful information (Reddit, YouTube) comes with toxic clickbait that you cannot disable.I realized that my addiction is to the point that I cannot reason my way out of it. There needs to be a physical barrier.A tangible example is sitting eating breakfast and the phone is sitting there and I so badly want to check cnn.com to see what is kicking off in politics.Today I decided not to check it, and my imagination ran wild and I got really motivated about work. If I checked the phone though this wouldn't have happened and I would have ruined my whole morning searching for little dopamine hits.Social media kills your imagination and injects someone else thoughts into your head. You want to let yourself think about things that you enjoy and motivate you INTRINSICALLY, not someone else because then you just keep needed to rely on their enthusiasm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791428</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I teach the introduction to computing class at MSU and agree entirely: most students need to start with the absolutely most simple introduction to computing possible.My favorite two models are:The Scott CPUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA (great book, website is now offline unfortunately: https://web.archive.org/web/20240430093449/https://www.butho...)An extremely simple non-pipelined 8 bit CPU.  The emulator lets you step through tick by tick and see how the machine code is driving an operation.  I spend one lecture showing each tick of a bitwise AND and following the data around from the instruction into the instruction register, how the instruction selects the general purpose registers, runs it through the ALU and then moves the data back from the accumulator into a register.  It's one of my favorite lectures of the year.The Little Man Computer - https://www.101computing.net/LMC/A higher level Von Neumann style computer that helps introduce students gently to assembly where they can fully understand the "machine code" since it's just decimal.  We then build an emulator, assembler and compiler for an extension to LMC that introduces the notion of a stack to support function calls.It's a fun one semester class, not as intense as NAND-to-Tetris but still an overview of how computing works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who haven't seen it before, throwing out nand2tetris and nandgame as another interesting journey from logic gates -&gt; computer programs running on a CPU.nandgame, in particular, is really easy to get started with and has been updated quite a lot over the year. If you looked at it a while ago check for new updates!nand2tetris goes into a bit more detail around some things, I like it too but harder to get started with.https://www.nand2tetris.org/https://www.nandgame.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just have to say. Such a beautiful and accessible website. No fluff, no ads, no distractions. I love it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793597</guid></item><item><title>10.

a) increased memory footprint for longer KV cache

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the grammatical and linguistic nuances of why "zero" is often treated as plural when referring to quantities. It examines how "zero" can imply the absence of quantity but may still require plural forms of nouns in specific contexts, such as "zero cars" or "zero chances." The conversation includes perspectives from language learners and experts, further illustrating the complexities of English language usage related to numbers and plurality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact - in Polish we have separate forms for 1 (singular), 2-4 (plural but nit many) and everything else. Zero is in “everything else”0 książek0.5 książki1 książka2,3,4 książki2.5 książki5 and above książek5.5 (any other fraction) książki&gt;100 and a fraction - dependsSingular is for one.The first plural is for things kind of treated as individual objects.The second plural is for things that are treated as a bulk/mass.The moment you use a fraction, the assumption is that you would need to count all I guess, so it’s treated as individual objects.From this perspective, zero of something is zero plural-not-easily countable. Kind of “Zero OF books” like “Ten OF books”, with of being implied by the form of the word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The answer says zero is treated as "plural" because we say "0 books".Interestingly, we can say either:1. "There are no books on this subject"2. "There is no book on this subject"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it extends from whatever rules govern the much-more-influential word "No", particularly for items which aren't normally capped at 1.Notice how these are all plural, and in each case "no" could be substituted with "zero":* "My shelf contains no books."* "Snails have no legs."* "What if there were no stars in the sky?"You can't simply replace those examples with a singular noun: You're either forced to refactor the grammar or you end up with something that sounds weird/archaic. Ex:* "My shelf contains no book." [Weird/archaic]* "My shelf does not contain a book. [Refactored]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42787651</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of proper lighting for working from home to enhance productivity and create a comfortable work environment. It emphasizes the balance between natural and artificial light, recommending specific types of lighting, such as LED and desk lamps, to reduce eye strain and improve focus. The article also suggests positioning workspaces near windows and using light-colored walls to maximize natural light, as well as providing tips on adjusting lighting based on the time of day and personal preferences. Overall, it aims to help individuals optimize their home office lighting setup for better work performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have always had great eyes with no problems, I didn't have to pay attention to any articles such as these because my eyes just did their job and everything was fine.BUT then I started working for myself and discovered that I had a pretty severe case of ADD for which I started taking medication. That caused quite a bit of dry eye, some because of the medication and some because I would just blink less. Shortly after that I also hit that age close to 50 where your eyes just degrade rapidly and stop focusing on close objects causing even more eye strain.In about the span of a week I went from "normal" eyes to extreme eye strain, pain and light sensitivity.I've had to make some big changes since then. I went for an eye checkup and got some glasses to help with the close vision. I also changed all my code, tools and web sites to dark mode where I can and turned down the brightness of all my displays a bit.I'm also taking a lot of eye drops and edited my work timer app to just beep every defined amount of time (around 20 minutes) so I could take a quick break to stare into the distance. Also changing viewing distance helps, for example if I'm looking at something on Youtube then getting up and standing 2-3 meters away from my desk helps your eyes rest a bit.I still need to look into lighting since I'm also sitting next to a big sliding glass door, so this article should come in handy there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of the guidelines that are used to light a scene for a camera are also quite useful for lighting a room for yourself, just with less light needed as the human eye has a much higher dynamic range than a camera sensor:* Use diffuse light. This usually means multiple light sources bouncing and diffusing light off surfaces (ceilings, walls, etc) or diffusers.* Minimize shadows. Shadows lead to contrast which can lead to eye strain. Use multiple, maybe directional, light sources to illuminate shadows.* Minimize highlights. Windows without blinds let in lots of light which leads to contrast and can lead to eye strain. Curtains and blinds are great ways to diffuse light.* Uniform color temperature. Try to make sure all your lights have the same color temperature. Small variations are okay but large color temperature variations lead to color contrast which also tends to be hard on eye strain.* Select your color temperature based on needs and feeling. A lot of people prefer warmer color temperature lights and cool temperature lights are known to be more stressful for folks with anxiety-related conditions, but if your work requires accurate color representation, or you find yourself mentally trying to compensate for color temperature, then change the temperature to what you find most productive yet relaxing.* Wall color. Remember that "white" light that reflects off colored surfaces will take on a hue similar to the reflected surfaces. Walls of different colors can cause challenges for uniform color temperature, and warm colored walls can take cold lights and turn them warm.A side effect, of course, is that your room will become a lot more photogenic. It's no coincidence since photogenic rooms are often just easiest on the eye to look at."Golden Hour" is considered a great time for photogenic events, photographs, and videos. "Golden Hour" lighting tends to be diffuse, not too strong, and warm toned. Humans tend to really like this style of lighting and if you do too, you might want to recreate some of these properties in your office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A big thing not often spoken about with eye strain is dry eye caused by the lack of blinking due to focusing on screens too close to our face.  This is an evolutionary phenomenon--close dangers cause extreme focus without blinking.  Extreme focus on close items reduces our blinks.Our eye lids have glands in them that release oils on your eye with each blink.  These oils help prevent the watery part of your tears from evaporating. When it evaporates your eyes dry out causing discomfort and potentially pain.If you don't blink enough, the oil doesnt get on your eyes and eventually, in extreme cases, the glands can even die.  A lack of oil in tears can cause extreme eye fatigue and even pain.This is why dry eyes is on the rise.  Remember to blink!I actually built a little web app to count my blinks.  See https://dryeyestuff.com/.  Not perfect, just a prototype.  100% free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42796950</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that it is written in Pascal:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engineThe minimal demos are still surprisingly big though (same ballpark as Unity web builds for similar simple demos).For a language without runtime I would expect a couple hundred kilobytes at most for those simple demos (but the download is 6.4 MB compressed and decompresses to 43 MByte, and takes significant time after the download is finished to start). Would be interesting to figure out why dead code doesn't seem to be removed by the compiler (e.g. is it because of the engine design, or because the Pascal-to-WASM compiler doesn't support dead code elimination). Also why is the compressed to uncompressed ratio so big, there seems to be a lot of duplicate code or data in those WASM files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool!The wasm file here could be optimized more. It looks like a 43 MB wasm is downloaded, and wasm-opt -O3 shrinks that to just 14 MB. It might also be faster that way (due to inlining and other optimizations). Startup will definitely be faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author articulates why he programs in Pascal: https://castle-engine.io/why_pascal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42761659</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;A federal court has ruled that backdoor searches of data collected under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) are unconstitutional, marking a significant victory for privacy advocates. The ruling challenges the government's practice of accessing data about U.S. citizens without a warrant and emphasizes the need for protecting individual rights against surveillance. This decision reinforces the importance of Fourth Amendment protections and raises concerns about the implications of warrantless searches in national security contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't worry: SCOTUS will determine that the Framers did not have a history and tradition of protecting metadata, so the Fourth Amendment has no application here; and, furthermore, the Court's recent jurisprudence regarding the Executive (dieu et mon droit) necessarily implies that the Government has an extremely compelling interest sufficient to overcome the Fourth Amendment and permit warrantless searches of everyone in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if congress ends their blatantly unconstitutional endorsement of Section 702 spying, I still don’t see why anyone would believe that the government is going to do anything other than massively expand their ability surveil every living moment of our lives. I don’t see the point in them trying to play it off like the system has any integrity whatsoever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny that even though the court ruled it is against the law to do so the federal agencies will continue to commit this crime (FBI) and pass illegal legislation (congress) until each specific agency changes it's internal regulations. If they do. The EFF seems to imply continued pressure is needed to convince them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42797756</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses ribbon microphones, highlighting their unique characteristics, construction, and sonic qualities. It explains how ribbon mics utilize a thin metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field to capture sound, resulting in a warm and natural tone. The text covers various applications, advantages and disadvantages of ribbon microphones compared to other types, and tips for usage in recording and live sound situations. It also addresses the specific care requirements and susceptibility of ribbon mics to damage, emphasizing their niche yet valued role in audio recording.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a bit of an eye opener to say the least. Highly, highly recommended.1: https://youtu.be/4Bma2TE-x6M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting feature of ribbon mics - because the ribbon is open at the front and the back, they reject sound from the side (and top/bottom) almost perfectly. You can arrange these cleverly in live or studio settings to amplify one thing while rejecting another completely.A typical usecase for this is a singer with an acoustic guitar - one mic can pick up the guitar and almost fully reject the vocals, and vice-versa. Pretty cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant Wired articles from 2011:* "Relics Reborn: Ribbon Microphones Rally for Vintage-Audio Geeks" https://www.wired.com/2011/01/gallery-ribbon-mics-part-1/ https://web.archive.org/web/20240118172709/https://www.wired...* "Ribbon Microphones: Audio Icon You Can Build in Your Garage" https://www.wired.com/2011/01/ribbon-mics-part-2/ https://web.archive.org/web/20160326035336/https://www.wired...

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on the performance of a new model for understanding the dynamics of non-equilibrium quantum systems. It explores the conditions under which the model can accurately predict quantum behavior during relaxation processes after a perturbation. The authors propose a framework that incorporates machine learning techniques to enhance the predictive capabilities of quantum state evolution, ultimately providing deeper insights into the complex interactions present in many-body quantum systems. The research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical approaches and practical applications in quantum computing and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech entrepreneur Jeff Atwood has announced his intention to donate millions of dollars over the next five years, motivated by a desire to impact society positively and inspire others in the tech community to give back. Atwood, known for co-founding Stack Overflow, emphasizes the importance of philanthropy and using one's resources for beneficial causes. He believes that technology leaders have a responsibility to leverage their success for the greater good and is committed to supporting various initiatives that align with his values.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm fortunate enough to be in one of the top percentiles of household income but I'm not independently wealthy and I have no idea how my kids are going to make it.Like Atwood, I did not come from a well-off family; parents divorced in my early teens and father passed away in my late teens from cancer (smoking and alcoholism) and in many ways lucked into a very good career after attending a state university.  My spouse's father -- a janitor in a public school -- and mother -- a crossing guard -- passed when she was in her 20's as well.  There weren't any large fortunes passed down.Some friends recently purchased a house in my township and I visited to drop off my kid for a play date.  I walked in and thought to myself "wow, this is a $1m house" ... except it looked just like mine...that I had purchased 9 years earlier for a fraction of the price.  It boggles the mind to consider when/how my kids will be able to have their slice of the American Dream.There are clearly some fundamental things that have to be fixed in the US at a policy level, but there's seemingly no political will to fix them; everyone seems out for themselves and to enrich their own coffers.  This is handicapping social mobility through the hostile policy positions towards social safety nets and foundational services (e.g. education, healthcare, childcare??).  This is the sentiment that I feel Atwood is also feeling.As a high earning software engineer (IC), I'm not sure how I can survive in the US once I can no longer find companies willing to hire me either because of AI or because of age (early 40's now so I figure maybe 10 years of high earning as an IC?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey Jeff! If you are reading this comments, I just want to say thank you! Thanks just for being a nice person. In this over individualistic world, you just shared what you know and helped other people.I'm your fan since the beginning of Coding Horror. Shared dozens of your blog posts. Stack Overflow changed how everybody programmed. I started coding in a pre-Internet time, when you got stuck, you just got stuck. I'm from Brazil and never went to USA, but I hope someday I can buy you a beer or a coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, it seems that extremely rich americans are discovering what scandinavian countries solve through taxation and effective government.They used to have it in some form with 'new deal' and 'great society' until ~1970, but now they can't because of the very same reasons that are making them extremely rich.Plus there's some fetisishation of efficiency of the private sector vs public one and distrust in public institutions, while in some areas I don't think it's warranted, it's just that public insititutions are more transparent than the private sector imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42767702</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was worried that an application I was building in Django, with a frontend built with Bootstrap and some LIGHT jquery was making me look like an old curmudgeon but the part about testability of the frontend really resonated with me. It was MUCH easier to structure everything as pytest unit tests and completely rely on Django for all the business logic rather than trying to put state in the frontend and deal with synchronizing states between FIVE distinct systems (remote devices, the Django application, the database, an event stream, AND the front end).I recognize that I'm not hip or with it, because I really fell out of front end development at the peak of jQuery where it was mostly about fixing browser incompatibilities, but it's nice to see that maybe it went too far in the other direction and we're overdue for a bit of a swing back towards server side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Let’s assume that making a JS change costs twice as much time a Ruby change, which I think is being generous to JS.Everyone's mileage varies, of course, but this is quite the assumption. It feels like a lack of familiarity/comfort with the frontend or poor tooling.With typescript and a basic UI library like MUI, this really shouldn't be the case for UI changes. If you're using raw JS and manipulating the DOM, maybe?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HN is not real world, just like how Reddit is not real world.I am a FE with 10 years of experience, and has tried, and tried really really hard and multiple attempts to make HTMX works well.Doesn’t work. UX is much worse, code discoverability is much worse, slower to code in, everything is messier than just plain React SPA with JSON data. Terrible, terrible DX and UX.Seriously, there is a reason why despite all the rage in going back to multi page Django/Rails app, very very few people actually take it seriously. You just don’t hear the negativity because most folks just tried it, saw that it is worse, and moved on without writing a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769822</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such an incredible game.I’m amazed what the Atari 2600 was capable of with 2 player sprites, 2 missile sprites, a ball sprite, 128 bytes of memory, no buffer, and a 1.19 MHz CPU.Because of what talented developers (like David Crane) could deliver, the console had an incredible 15 year lifespan (longer than the NES).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got an Atari Gamestation Pro for Christmas and it just amazes me how well a lot of those old 2600 games hold up.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I think about "civilization ending" events this kind of compute comes up since it seems more simple/more robust granted it can do much less than a modern computer. I also have heard of the argument at that time it doesn't matter, you can die from sepsis or whatever vs. trying to run a computer.It is like witchcraft seeing someone produce VGA out with some raw/more tangible chips.I also think about how like on an Arduino you can have a filesystem, make a makeshift notepad via printing/serial in.Idk... same with RISC V, if a computer works to me do I care what's under the hood. Anyway I did take a course where you learned about flip-flops/registeres, design your own 8-bit ALU, etc... I can appreciate it again "tangible" vs. a single IC that does everything. It's like those cheap games where they have a single chip under a black blob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  I am in no way associated with any activies selling the Minimal 64x4 as a product. Any such activity represents a license violation. Individual licenses apply for hardware and software parts.Maybe I should read everything, but what does this mean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't quite get the complexity/performance graph's X axis.Around the time of the early microprocessors in the 1970s, vastly greater performance was obtainable via discrete parts, for the simple reason that more parallel stuff could be built than the LSI of the day could accommodate (e.g. 32-bit datapath).  He even has a specific X axis point with the MSI 74181 bit slice ALU chip - which was in all the high-performance discrete part CPUs of the day, either that one or the AM2901 which also contained registers.So X axis should be in net complexity in transistors or gates, regardless  of implementation.  That being said, the device presented still gets an enormous amount of compute per TTL chip, especially considering no dedicated ALU is involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42794232</guid></item><item><title>24.

Kind of like a diet Obsidian with sync?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers might be interested in notepad-next, which is under active development and cross platform: https://github.com/dail8859/NotepadNext&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve got a chrome extension sitting in the review queue right now that leans a bit more dev-centric in that it opens a Monaco-based editor (with markdown preview) whenever it detects you’ve opened a raw text file in the current tab.It also supports creating new documents, but that’s more of an ancillary use case (for me anyhow).The nice thing is that it’s 100% local.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791820</guid></item><item><title>25.

It is a delicate balance!Congratulations on releasing! Very cool project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is bonkers and so cool that you did this solo.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the notable case of the Therac-25, a radiation therapy machine that caused patient overdoses due to software errors and inadequate safety measures. It examines the technical failures, including the reliance on software without proper safeguards, as well as the organizational culture that prioritized speed over safety. The case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of rigorous testing, thorough documentation, and maintaining a strong safety culture in engineering and healthcare technology to prevent catastrophic failures.&lt;/p&gt;

The following is a description and/or examples of significant dangers and risks associated with this activity
Acute gullibility, Failure to understand April Fool's jokes, Night terrors associated with medical radiation machines .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading --- and vehemently disagreeing --- with the report on the incidents, which danced around the matter but didn't point directly at the underlying cause: excessive complexity in the software, which easily created bugs and hid them. For example, they used multiple threads and a whole OS, when a simple loop would've been sufficient, perhaps in a misguided attempt at trying to keep the UI "responsive"; there would not be any race conditions if everything ran in the same thread.As Tony Hoare says: "There are two ways to develop software: Make it so simple that there are obviously no bugs, or so complex that there are no obvious bugs."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leveson's fantastic Therac-25 paper is probably the most important document in the formative years of my young sweng career.I still re-read it every couple of years, and it's held up a lot better than one of my other early favorites, which was Feynman's appendix to the Challenger report. In the sense that I still draw new thoughts and realizations from it as I re-read it with additional experience in some of the engineering and organizational disciplines it touches. Sad as it is, it's got a little bit of everything.It's definitely got my vote for the I Ching of critical systems engineering.Spend the time. Chances are you'll remember it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42797798</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;In "Open Socrates," Agnes Callard presents a thought-provoking exploration of the philosophy of Socrates, advocating for a model of life that encourages open dialogue and critical questioning. The book delves into how Socratic principles can be applied to contemporary issues, emphasizing the importance of engaging with diverse perspectives to foster personal and collective growth. Callard's work aims to inspire readers to embrace a more inquisitive and reflective approach to life, making the case for the relevance of ancient philosophical concepts in today's world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big fan of Agnes Callard, and ofc, Socrates. I know many people dislike philosophy because they consider it to be a form of intellectual gymnastics, but at its best it's almost spiritual activity, a concern with the whole purpose of life, a desire to not live as an unthinking automaton, impelled by instinct or social pressure. Socrates is the ultimate and prototypical embodiment of this, a refusal to take anything at its word, a man who interrogated the deepest things and pointed us to the abundant fruits of a life of inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socrates probably would have annoyed me too.I’m terrible at picking words. Can’t stand the popular notion of “debate,” internet or in person; so much uncharitable interpretation, obtuseness and deflection, and being held to a standard of angelic impeccable speech when trying to express something.Intellectual consistency can be vastly overrated. I don’t pretend to have answers, I still have convictions that can’t be proven.  I get by to a fair extent on vibes and faith—and the faith that if I continue re-examining myself, I might hope to approach truth, and might be a better person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "Tolstoy Problem" is an interesting phenomenon that occurs to me from time to time.Paraphrased, if I know I am close to death, maybe an hour away, and I know there's no time left to change things, how will I feel about my legacy or net outcome of my existence?I find it a useful contemplative exercise that everyone could do from time to time, especially a few world leaders IMHO.It's easy for one's subconscious to feed the line that, yes, I'll sort it all out tomorrow. But it's the "no time left" constraint that focuses the mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42792718</guid></item><item><title>29.

Can't go past this without a heads-up for Greg Egan's 2014 short story Seventh Sight, where the protagonists hack their (at the time bleeding-edge tech) eye implants, allowing them to be part of a vanishingly-small group of people that can see into the infrared and ultraviolet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember removing the IR filter from a cheap webcam and seeing everything in a new light (haha, pun intended) was fascinating. One of my black coats that didn't get hot under the sun and appeared more reflective and. I remember some opaque things like Coke being much more translucent.These winning photos are a bit boring my comparison, the ghostly effect of foliage in IR is cool but a bit overdone when there's so many and there were so many other interesting differences in every day objects.I'd love to do the same with my mirrorless camera but it's a quite destructive operation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Original article https://kolarivision.com/life-in-another-light-infrared-phot...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42751563</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; GFiber service will be available in parts of the metro area later this year. Nevada residents and business owners will be able to choose between Google Fiber’s plans with prices that haven’t changed since 2012 and speeds up to 8 gig.The author of the press release is under the mistaken belief that unchanged broadband pricing is a good thing.From the linked price page:1gig: $70/mo2gig: $100/mo5gig: $125/mo8 gig: $150/moThere was a time I would have been insanely jealous of any fiber option at all here in the Bay Area, and I know how hard it is to find fiber anywhere in the US, even still here in many parts of the Bay.But when the fiber actually arrives, it becomes clear how cheap it is to provide.When AT&amp;T finally rolled fiber to my house in ~2019 it was $80/mo for 1gig symmetrical.And you know AT&amp;T's shareholders are still making money hand over fist at that price, because today, I pay Sonic $50 per month for 10gig symmetrical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking as a former Google Fiber software engineer, I'm honestly surprised this is still around.In 2017, basically all the Google Fiber software teams went on hiatus (mine included). I can't speak to the timing or rationale but my theory is that the Google leadership couldn't decide if the future of Internet was wired or wireless and a huge investment in wired may be invalidated if the future Internet was wired so rather than guessing wrong, the leadership simply decided to definitely lose by mothballing the whole thing.At that time, several proposed cities were put on hiatus, some of which had already hired local people. In 2019, Google Fiber exited Louisville, KY, paying penalties for doing so [1]. That really seemed like the end.I also speculated that Google had tried or was trying to sell the whole thing. I do wonder if the resurrection it seems to have undergone is simply a result of the inability to find a buyer. I have no information to suggest that one way or the other.There were missteps along the way. A big example was the TV software that was originally an acquisition, SageTV [2]. Somebody decided it would be a good idea to completely rewrite this Java app into Web technologies on an embedded Chrome instance on a memory-limited embedded CPU in a set-top box. Originally planned to take 6 months, it took (IIRC) 3.5+ years.But that didn't actually matter at all in the grand scheme of things because the biggest problem and the biggest cost was physical network infrastructure. It is incredibly expensive and most of the issues are hyperlocal (eg soil conditions, city ordinances) as well as decades of lobbying by ISPs of state and local governments to create barriers against competition.[1]: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/googl...[2]: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/06/googl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back when I lived in Ukraine in 2021, I got our family a 1Gbps fiber connection.We lived on the edge of the city, and it was insanely hard to find a provider.I knew internet was super cheap in Ukraine and was going to leave Ukraine in the following years, so getting a 1Gbps fiber as an all-time-at-home person was a great idea.I ended up finding 2 providers that had fiber, and 1 of them had 1Gbps.I was super happy to have symmetrical 1Gbps for $15 a month for the time I could spend there.Here, in Vancouver, I am happy to have 250Mbps/15Mbps for $40 per month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42798293</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the thread-safety issues associated with the C standard library, highlighting that it is not inherently thread-safe and often leads to concurrency problems in programming. It points out that even Rust, which is designed with safety in mind, cannot fully mitigate these issues when interfacing with C libraries. The author emphasizes the challenges developers face when trying to build reliable multi-threaded applications using C libraries and advocates for better practices and safer alternatives in managing concurrency in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let me try to help:1. If a process crashes and dumps, be sure to look at the system log of the cause (e.g. SIGSEGV, OOM, invalid instruction, etc.)2. Be certain you’re looking at the right core dumps — I believe UID 1000 just means posix UserID (which is unrelated to a PID), though I don’t use containers.3. Stay focused on the right level of abstraction — memory model details are great to know, but irrelevant here.4. Variables do not correlate 1:1 with registers, except in C calling conventions. The assumption about x20 and a local variable is incorrect, unfortunately.5. getenv() and setenv() do not work as implied in the post. When a process starts via execve(), the OS/libc constructs a new snapshot of the environment, and cannot be modified by an ancestral process. It’s a snapshot in time, unless updated by the process itself. When a process fork()s, the child gets a new copy of the parent’s environment — updates do not propagate.getenv() is thread safe and reentrant. You don’t use an environment to pass shared data — setenv() is generally used when constructing the environment for a child process before a fork(). See man environment.6. FWIW, ‘char** env’ is a null-terminated array of pointers, so dumping memory from *env (or env[0]) is only valid until you hit the first NULL. The size of the array is not stored in the array.I hope this helps! And apologies if this is redundant — I read so many comments; mostly variations of “the problem with getenv is x”, but gave up before reading all of the (currently) 168 comments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major takeaway from this is that Rust will be making environment setters unsafe in the next edition. With luck, this will filter down into crates that trigger these crashes (https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-probe/issues/30 filed upstream in the meantime).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Rust std, `set_var` and `remove_var` will correctly require using an `unsafe {}` block in the next edition (2024). The documentation does now mention the safety issue but obviously it was a mistake to make these functions safe originally (albeit a mistake even higher level languages have made).https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/env/fn.set_var.htmlThere is a patch for glibc which makes `getenv` safe in more cases where the environment is modified but C still allows direct access to the environ so it can't be completely safe in the face of modification https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/7a61e7f557a97ab597d6f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42796058</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if we always had hypermedia with directories and files, why hasn't the web evolved into a mesh of interconnected file systems?It kind of has.  URLs have the notion of paths, which are obviously strongly associated with the notion of file system hierarchies.  People sometimes (sometimes accidentally) put their file systems directly on the web, see DirectoryIndex in apache for example.&gt; Why isn't a website just a remote directory on someone's computer that we can explore via a file browser?Well now we are getting into the meat of it.  To be a hypermedia requires the presence of hypermedia controls in a media.  Hypermedia controls can be as simple as links, but the web introduced more sophisticated controls such as forms, and allowed HTML authors to specify more significant interactions beyond click-to-link.IMO the uniform interface is the most interesting aspect of hypermedia, and that really emerged post Web.  I like the authors concept of a file explorer enhanced with hypermedia ideas though and would be interested to see more details on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you think that file system is a viable approach to web site, how would implement Hacker News? Hacker News is one of the old-school static-rendered sites. It may not even use a database.But it needs to be dynamic. The ordering on the front page is dynamic. The vote counts are dynamic. What does the voting? These are all easier to have a database with values that query and then render the page.The other issue adding new content. How would someone post a comment? How and where does it get written? How do you make sure they write to right place? How do you make it easy to use as typing in box and hitting button?Dynamic responses are the special sauce of the web, they are why it is a success. Without it, it would be good-looking Gopher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You would create and manage content directly from the file explorer application, in the most natural way possible.
This version of the web wouldn’t require users to learn advanced computer skills in order to participate.My students at university (Gen Z) have no concept of the “file system”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42774758</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve encountered a couple of these Sunfish (“Mola mola”) in the wild off the coast of Southern California. They’re absolutely incredible to see in person and massive! While it seemed to enjoy our presence we made sure not to get too close or they might mistake your boat for a rock and try to flop on board, which is the only way they’ve ever killed a human. I’ve read they move to warmer waters as they age and the ones I saw were “only” around 800-1200 pounds. The ones around Indonesia can be 3000 pounds or more. Fascinating creature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the pandemic / lockdown I was lucky enough to visit one of the reef pontoons off Cairns (Australia, on the Great Barrier Reef) that had been shut for several months. The resident Maori wrasse (a very large fish) at this pontoon, and others, has been known to have a relationship with some of the regular staff - often rubbing up against them in the water. When we jumped in the water that day the fish's reaction was the wildest thing I've ever seen. It was like a small puppy who has been locked inside all day. It literally jumped into my arms, flapping its tail to get closer. I'm going to repeat - this is a big fish, maybe a metre long and stocky, covered in a nice thick layer of slime. It would then swim away and come back and rub up against us. It did this to all three of us in the group ... only one of us was a regular. She hung with us for the whole snorkel and it was a bit sad when we had to get out of the water. Amazing experience. Made me feel differently about wrasses, that's for sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We "met" a king penguin at Singapore Bird Paradise that would follow people around at the edge of the tank (an acrylic sheet separated you from their enclosure) and try to interact. It swam up to my wife and followed her around, then went to another bunch of people and did the same. It seemed to enjoy watching people watching it and waving to it. Not every animal does, but this one did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42766500</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of ternary logic in computing, specifically addressing common misconceptions about its efficiency compared to binary systems. It explains that while many assume ternary systems could provide a 50% increase in information processing due to the use of three values instead of two, this is misleading. The author delves into the complexities of implementing ternary logic in hardware and programming, emphasizing that the theoretical advantages may not translate to practical performance improvements. The piece encourages a more nuanced understanding of ternary logic and its potential applications in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

If a given problem is possible to encode as a function of three bits (eight states), then there's an efficient instruction to process it.The naming is unfortunate, though, since TERNLOG implies ternary logic - an operation working on trits, with possible values being -1, 0, 1, instead of just 0 and 1. Instead, it's ternary in the same vein where C's    foo ? bar : baz

takes three operands, and is therefore ternary, and it performs logical operations - hence TERN-LOG.&gt; In a reduction, each application of the binary operator decrements the number of values by 2−1=1, but each application of the ternary operator decrements it by 3−1=2!Ha, there's an exclamation mark there! It's not 2, it's actually 2 factorial, which i...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving computational science problems by integrating physics-based modeling with deep learning. It highlights the advantages of PINNs, such as their ability to incorporate physical laws directly into the training process, which allows for more accurate predictions and the solution of complex equations governing physical phenomena. The piece provides an overview of the methodology, including the formulation of loss functions and the implementation of neural networks, and emphasizes their potential to revolutionize fields like fluid dynamics, materials science, and biomedical engineering by enabling efficient and precise simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FWIW - I used to do research in this area - PINNs are a terribly overhyped idea.See for example https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00897-5Classical solvers are very very good at solving PDEs. In contrast PINNs solve PDEs by... training a neural network. Not once, that can be used again later. But every single time you solve a new PDE!You can vary this idea to try to fix it, but it's still really hard to make it better than any classical method.As such the main use cases for PINNs -- they do have them! -- is to solve awkward stuff like high-dimensional PDEs or nonlocal operators or something. Here it's not that the PINNs got any better, it's just that all the classical solvers fall off a cliff.---Importantly -- none of the above applies to stuff like neural differential equations or neural closure models. These are genuinely really cool and have wide-ranging applications.! The difference is that PINNs are numerical solvers, whilst NDEs/NCMs are techniques for modelling data./rant ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on a team that has actually deployed NN based surrogate models into production in industry. We don’t use PINNs for the simple reason that many industrial scale solvers are solving significantly more complex systems than a single global PDE (at least in CFD, perhaps other areas are simpler). For instance, close to the boundaries, the solver our engineers use uses an approximation that does not satisfy conservation of mass and momentum. So when we try to use physical constraints, our accuracy goes down. Even in the cases where we could technically use PINNs we find they are underwhelming, and spending time on crafting better training data sets has always been a better option for us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Me and a friend were discussing PINNs, and he made an argument against them: The Bitter Lesson. PINNs are a way of incorporating domain knowledge into ML models. The Bitter Lesson, for those unaware, is a famous essay by Rich Sutton that states that the history of AI is full of attempts of methods guided by domain/expert knowledge, but that ultimately, all such methods were overtaken by methods that simply scaled data and/or computation.http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.htmlI would love to hear HN's take on this argument.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769623</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has significantly increased its lobbying efforts, boosting its spending nearly seven-fold as it aims to influence legislation and regulations surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). This surge in lobbying reflects the company’s growing recognition of the importance of shaping public policy in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. As AI technology continues to advance, OpenAI's intensified advocacy highlights the need for clear guidelines and frameworks that govern AI development and deployment, signaling its proactive approach to address potential legal and ethical challenges associated with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

There's a whole constellation of consultants, think tanks, industry groups, "grasstops" organizers, push pollsters, etc. that are the real (undisclosed) iceberg under the surface.For example, here's an example of an effort to persuade Congress not to update copyright laws to account for model training, which was only revealed because of metadata accidentally included in a PDF file. https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/23/tech-lawyer-ai-lett...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of when Walter Gilbert's team faced challenges in cloning the human insulin gene due to a moratorium on recombinant DNA research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which forced them to relocate to England. This relocation impacted their progress, allowing the team from Genentech and the City of Hope National Medical Center to successfully clone the gene first in 1978, leading to the production of the first genetically engineered drug, human insulin.Gilbert still got the Nobel Prize for his work sequencing of nucleotides.Researchers in AI, likewise, will have to relocate to more favorable countries losing precious time.https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/15258-Government-restrictions-on...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ofc... it's easier to create legal barriers to entry than to offer a better product than the competition :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793567</guid></item><item><title>40. 2,100-year-old Alexander the Great mosaic analyzed for restoration</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-01-echoing-eternity-year-alexander-great.html</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd highly recommend going to Sterling Hill Mine  https://www.sterlinghillminingmuseum.org/ and Franklin Mineral Museum https://www.franklinmineralmuseum.org/. They both allow collection of fluorescent minerals from the mine dumps on certain days. If you go to the Natural History Museum in NYC you can see some very impressive fluorescent minerals sourced from these two locations. Also the mine tour is worth it, if nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool photos, nice to see rocks from a perspective I'd not seen before.I came across this recently - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence where it sounds like some rocks emit light upon heating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wouldn't a mono camera and filter wheel be ideal setup for this sort of purpose? Assuming you are interested more in the mineralogy than pretty pictures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42795085</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), a key concept in object-oriented programming that emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of a program. It explains the principle's significance in ensuring reliable behavior in code through proper use of inheritance. The author elaborates on common pitfalls and misconceptions regarding LSP, using practical examples and code snippets to illustrate how to effectively design classes and inheritances in a way that adheres to this principle, ultimately promoting better software architecture and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liskov substitution will not save you. One of the worst cases of inheritance I've ever seen was in a hierarchy that was a perfect Liskov fit -- an even better fit than traditional examples like "a JSON parser is a parser". See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42512629.The fundamental problem with inheritance, and one not shared by any other kind of polymorphism, is that you can make both upcalls and downcalls within the same hierarchy. No one should ever use inheritance in any long-term production use case without some way of enforcing strict discipline, ensuring that calls can only go one way -- up or down, but not both. I don't know to what extent tooling to enforce this discipline exists.(Also I just realized I got punked by LLM slop.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And functional programmers would argue that contravariance is the real meaning of Liskov’s substitution principle: https://apocalisp.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/liskov-substituti...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here to recommend this article, really helped me to understand inheritance better. Liskov Substitution is just one aspect / type of it and may conflict with others.https://www.sicpers.info/2018/03/why-inheritance-never-made-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777144</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage provides an overview of the "evo" project, which is a simple evolutionary algorithm implemented in Python. The project demonstrates the concepts of genetic algorithms, showcasing how a population of potential solutions evolves over generations to solve optimization problems. It includes features such as selection, crossover, and mutation, allowing users to explore evolutionary processes and modify parameters to observe different outcomes. The repository contains the source code, documentation, and instructions for running the simulations, making it accessible for both beginners and those interested in evolutionary computation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this project again, author was getting absolutely shredded on the Go subreddit earlier today for having no clue what he is buildinghttps://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1i6v9ou/evo_a_new_v...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm definitely interested in the promise here. But it seems very early days.I'm sceptical about the whole "make a workspace for a feature, then code, then merge" workflow. For me in practice work often doesn't follow that linear path, I don't really know what feature will be finished and ready for committing until done.One very surprising thing I have learnt about git is that it is intuitive for some people. Whereas maybe half of its users, including me, will never really get it, even after decades of use. So I am also skeptical about broad claims of intuitiveness.I think the problem of creating a truly user friendly distributed version control system CLI is enormously challenging and requires a lot of deep thought if it is going to meet the needs of a wide range of software development practices. Looking at the DESIGN.md does not convince me they have gone deep enough in that analysis. It has a bit of a blase "it's just common sense that it should work like this!" and I'm pretty certain it's not so easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cute, but just use jj. It has all the features evo promises (plus undo and first-class conflicts) but is robust, refined, and ready to use today. Structural merges sound like an anti-feature.https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42787371</guid></item><item><title>44.

My wife recently went through chemo and rad.I'm thankful that I was able to go to her treatments, because the first chemo.  Shortly after it started, I pointed out that she was really flush and had started "breathing funny" (kind of repeatedly sighing).  She hadn't noticed, but decided to pull the "oh shit string".  A couple minutes later 8 nurses were in the room with a crash cart, working feverishly while one nurse kept taking her BP and calling out smaller and smaller numbers until it stopped registering.  Meanwhile, I'm stuck in a chair in the corner, trying not to be in the way, and coming to terms that I might be going home alone.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of the testing pyramid in software development, advocating for a re-evaluation of its traditional structure. It highlights potential limitations of the pyramid model, such as the imbalance between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The author suggests a more flexible approach that prioritizes testing based on the application’s needs and the development context, rather than adhering strictly to the pyramid’s hierarchy. The piece emphasizes the importance of finding a balance in testing strategies to improve software quality and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay? This seems like a fluff blog post as the trophy concept was coined back in 2018 if I am correct. Coming from wiremock it makes sense given their product, but it is just marketing fluff.Honestly, as long as the GUI tip remains as small as possible I am mostly fine with whatever shape it takes below there. For modern web applications with a lot of APIs it does make sense to use a trophy. For other applications without such a communication layer a more traditional pyramid does make more sense.What a lot of people often seem to completely overlook in discussions like this is that the pyramid isn't a goal in itself. It is intended as a way to think about where you place your tests. More specifically place tests where they make sense, provide most value and are least fragile.Which is why the GUI should be avoided for any test that are testing logic, hence being the smallest section on whatever shape you come up with. Everything else highly depends on what sort of infrastructure you are dealing with, the scope of your application, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure you ought to make the tests you think are needed, and the 'form' is not a good metric.Our libraries with a lot of logic and calculations are dominated by unit tests, our libraries that talk to external API are dominated by integration tests. That's just good testing, I'm not sure you need to imagine a pyramid or a vase to decide the tests you do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The pyramid is also an artifact of the era in which it was created.&gt; Computers were slower, testing and debugging tools were rudimentary, and developer infrastructure was bloated, cumbersome, and inefficient."What AMD giveth, Electron taketh away.No matter how fast computers get, developers will figure out a way to use that extra compute to make the build and the test cycle slower again.Of course it is all relative - it is hard to define what a "unit" test is when you are building on top of enormous abstractions to begin with.No matter what you call the test, it should be fast. I feel productive when I can iterate on a piece of code with 2 second feedback time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42770341</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The website explores the process of migrating a WordPress blog to a static site using Hugo, an open-source static site generator. It outlines the advantages of using Hugo for improved performance and security, and provides a step-by-step guide on how to export WordPress content, configure Hugo, and deploy the static site. Additionally, it highlights best practices and tips for ensuring a smooth transition and optimizing the new site for search engines. Overall, the content serves as a practical resource for those looking to enhance their blogging experience by adopting a static site architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty cool! I ported my own WP blog to a static site generator (my own but with a format inspired by Hugo) a while back and hacked together a script with wpparser and some custom code to spit out markdown (it was a while back but I think just regexes). It got me the bulk of the way there but I still had to go through every page and tweak it to get everything just right. Would happily have paid $150 to avoid that.Are you keeping URLs stable? That was tricky for me IIRC, along with RSS.(The very trickiest bit was probably specific to me. I still have inbound links with the page in a "/?p=3" kind of query param, which I think was the WordPress default 20-odd years ago. I didn't want to make the root URL for the site non-static to handle that, so I wound up putting some JS in my index page template that checks for that kind of thing. If it spots it, it changes window.location to a specific URL that is delegated a Flask site that knows where to redirect people. Link in bio if anyone wants to see how it works. I should probably blog about it sometime!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I may be wrong here, but I understood Hugo sites to be static sites, therefore not supporting comments, for example. How does your tool handle migrating a WordPress side with comments to a Hugo site?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing @symkat, love seeing developer side projects.Was curious why you picked Hugo over something like Astro.  I'm migrating a site off of Jekyll and have found Astro has a lot of interesting features if I want to use them but is at its heart a static site generator and seems to be a pretty easy lift to migrate to.  Haven't done much evaluation of Hugo yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42795249</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Let's Not Do That" provides a platform for discussing and raising awareness about various societal issues and behaviors that are detrimental or harmful. It encourages individuals to reflect on actions and practices that should be avoided for the betterment of communities and personal growth. The site features articles, discussions, and resources aimed at inspiring change and promoting positive alternatives to negative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many kinds of "negative" responses:0. This idea is bad.1. This idea is probably bad, but if someone wants to put together a more compelling argument we will discuss it at a future meeting.2. This idea needs to be more fully developed before we can decide whether it is good or bad.3. This idea is probably good, but it will remain in backlog limbo until someone makes a compelling argument that it is a priority.4. This idea is good, and while it is not a high-enough priority to displace our current tasks, we will actively discuss including it when we plan our next sprint/release.Depending on who you work with these may need to be gussied up with manager-speak to let people save face or to prevent people from hijacking the agenda to turn the meeting into a brainstorming session. But treating all of them as synonymous with "no" loses useful nuance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sort of advice is parodied in "Yes, Prime Minister" as the 4 step strategy for "crisis management"1: Don't worry, nothing's going to happen.2: Something may be happen but we should wait and see3: Maybe we should do something about it, but there is no clear action4: Maybe there was something we could've done, but it's too late nowStringing along a bunch of people who think they are being heard and listened to when you are not is a morale killer when the tide goes out &amp; we see who's been swimming naked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Please fill out the feature request form - that will create a ticket." Mark ticket P4.In all seriousness, the best thing is to have management that clearly communicates what the high level company goals are on a quarterly (or whatever cadence is appropriate for your business) basis. People don't like to hear no, but they understand "the main objective for the quarter is to close $X in new deals in Y market segment, and since this isn't going to directly contribute to that, it's not going to be a priority in the near future."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42771310</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; NSFW should be opt-in, not default.
&gt; How do people report offensive, doxing and unsafe content?
  Do you have moderators, and can they scale if it comes lot 
  more popular?&gt; Why not also people to browse the web version?
  It can be a lot easier for accessibility. 
  I sometimes need a bigger font than what the default is.
  Adjusting it on the mobile is ok but the screen is tiny
  so there is all manner of scrolling in all directions to 
  read the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just echoing other comments as the first post I saw was from someone who wanted a knife so they could "stab girls" while whispering in their ear that they are "getting their hormones". Wow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest piece of feedback I think I have gotten from posting here is that the nsfw content is a bit shocking which I get. Sorry about that.My guess is that if you just scrolled twitter or whatever by new exclusively unfiltered you wouldn’t have that different an experience.On the one hand I do think there is something interesting about the rawness of this network but also some sort of smart nsfw filtering is clearly needed, and I've been in the bubble of making this long enough to have become a bit desensitized.I will get that shipped within the week!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42800893</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the differences and use cases for gRPC, OpenAPI, and REST in API development. It provides an overview of gRPC, a modern RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that excels in performance and efficiency, particularly for microservices, and contrasts it with REST, a widely-used architectural style that is easier to implement and widely supported across platforms. Additionally, it introduces OpenAPI, a specification that standardizes RESTful APIs, making it easier to describe and consume them. The article highlights key considerations for choosing between these technologies based on factors like performance, ease of use, and specific application needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I could go back in time I would stop myself from ever learning about gRPC. I was so into the dream, but years later  way too many headaches. Don’t do it to yourself.Saying gRPC hides the internals is a joke. You’ll get internals all right, when you’re blasting debug logging trying to figure out what the f is going on causing 1/10 requests to fail and fine tuning 10-20 different poorly named and timeout / retry settings.Hours lost fighting with maven plugins. Hours lost debugging weird deadline exceeded. Hours lost with LBs that don’t like the esoteric http2. Firewall pain meaning we had to use Standard api anyway. Crappy docs. Hours lost trying to get error messages that don’t suck into observability.I wish I’d never heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been building API's for a long time, using gRPC, and HTTP/REST (we'll not go into CORBA or DCOM, because I'll cry). To that end, I've open sourced a Go library for generating your clients and servers from OpenAPI specs (https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen).I disagree with the way this article breaks down the options. There is no difference between OpenAPI and REST, it's a strange distinction. OpenAPI is a way of documenting the behavior of your HTTP API. You can express a RESTful API using OpenAPI, or something completely random, it's up to you. The purpose of OpenAPI is to have a schema language to describe your API for tooling to interpret, so in concept, it's similar to Protocol Buffer files that are used to specify gRPC protocols.gRPC is an RPC mechanism for sending protos back and forth. When Google open sourced protobufs, they didn't opensource the RPC layer, called "stubby" at Google, which made protos really great. gRPC is not stubby, and it's not as awesome, but it's still very efficient at transport, and fairly easy too extend and hook into. The problem is, it's a self-contained ecosystem that isn't as robust as mainstream HTTP libraries, which give you all kinds of useful middleware like logging or auth. You'll be implementing lots of these yourself with gRPC, particularly if you are making RPC calls across services implemented in different languages.To me, the problem with gRPC is proto files. Every client must be built against .proto files compatible with the server; it's not a discoverable protocol. With an HTTP API, you can make calls to it via curl or your own code without having the OpenAPI description, so it's a "softer" binding. This fact alone makes it easier to work with and debug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has worked at a few of the FAANGs, having thrift/grpc is a godsend for internal service routing, but a lot of the complexity is managed by teams building the libraries, creating the service discovery layers, doing the routing etc. But using an RPC protocol enables those things to happen on a much greater scale and speed than you could ever do with your typical JSON/REST service. I've also never seen a REST API that didn't leak verbs. If I need to build a backend service mesh or wire two local services together via an networked stream, I will always reach for grpc.That said, I absolutely would not use grpc for anything customer or web facing. RPC is powerful because it locks you into a lot of decisions and gives you "the one way". REST is far superior when you have many different clients with different technology stacks trying to use your service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799245</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of psychedelic graphics, exploring their origins, characteristics, and the cultural impact they have had over the years. It highlights how these vibrant and intricate designs evoke emotional responses and can serve as a means of expression and exploration of consciousness. The piece also touches upon modern applications of psychedelic art in various media, as well as its resurgence in contemporary culture and its connection to mental health and self-exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

As @hopkins has mentioned, we used high end Silicon Graphics workstations to create synthetic imagery to accompany live music, including notably the Grateful Dead, Herbie Hancock, and Graham Nash.After many iterations I'm currently working mainly in 2D video processing environments, Resolume Avenue and TouchDesigner.  The links here are inspiring, thanks for posting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to play around with psychedelic graphics without going too low-level, [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a cool javascript based livecoding environment with a gentle learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love how easy it is to write shaders that operate on images in HTML. My skills in this area are mediocre but I love seeing how far people can take it. Even providing a simple approximation of a depth map can really make the results interesting.Some years ago I did a similar project to smoothly crossfade (with "interesting effects") between images using some of the same techniques.

&lt;p&gt;The paper titled "An Overview of the Generalized Linear Models" presents a comprehensive examination of generalized linear models (GLMs), which extend traditional linear modeling to accommodate various types of response variables. It outlines the fundamental concepts, including the link function and the importance of the exponential family of distributions, while discussing various applications of GLMs in statistics and data analysis. The paper also highlights the advantages of using GLMs for modeling data exhibiting non-normal distributions, thereby providing insights into the versatility and applicability of these models in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for Llama.vim provides a Vim plugin that integrates with LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) for text editing and development purposes. It facilitates the use of LLaMA's language generation capabilities directly within the Vim editor, enhancing the coding experience by enabling features like autocompletion, code suggestions, and natural language processing tasks. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and configuration options to tailor the plugin to individual workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN, happy to see this here!I highly recommend to take a look at the technical details of the server implementation that enables large context usage with this plugin - I think it is interesting and has some cool ideas [0].Also, the same plugin is available for VS Code [1].Let me know if you have any questions about the plugin - happy to explain. Btw, the performance has improved compared to what is seen in the README videos thanks to client-side caching.[0] - https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/9787[1] - https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vscode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone compare this to Tabbyml?[0] I just set that up yesterday for emacs to check it out.The context gathering seems very interesting[1], and very vim-integrated, so I'm guessing there isn't anything very similar for Tabby. I skimmed the docs and saw some stuff about context for the Tabby chat feature[2] which I'm not super interested in using even if the docs adding sounds nice, but nothing obvious for the auto completion[3].Does anyone have more insight or info to compare the two?As a note, I quite like that the LLM context here "follows" what you're doing. It seems like a nice idea. Does anyone know if anyone else does something similar?[0] https://www.tabbyml.com/[1] https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/9787#issue-25729... "global context onwards"[2] https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/administration/context/[3] https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/administration/code-completio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very exciting - I'm a long-time vim user but most of my coworkers use VSCode, and I've been wanting to try out in-editor completion tools like this.After using it for a couple hours (on Elixir code) with Qwen2.5-Coder-3B and no attempts to customize it, this checks a lot of boxes for me:  - I pretty much want fancy autocomplete: filling in obvious things and saving my fingers the work, and these suggestions are pretty good
  - the default keybindings work for me, I like that I can keep current line or multi-line suggestions
  - no concerns around sending code off to a third-party
  - works offline when I'm traveling
  - it's fast!

So I don't need to remember how to run the server, I'll probably set up a script to check if it's running and if not start it up in the background and run vim, and alias vim to use that. I looked in the help documents but didn't see a way to disable the "stats" text after the suggestions, though I'm not sure it will bother me that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806328</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When my wife and I lived in Bristol we developed a metric designed to measure how enjoyable a city was to live in that we called "time to sheep".
Basically it's a measure of how long you have to travel from the center of the city before you're in the English countryside surrounded by sheep and the best cities have a low (but not too low) "time to sheep" metric. It helped explain one of the reasons we loved living in Bristol so much when we had such a hard time living in London.Could also have been that Bristol is just a crazy beautiful city to live in, but where's the fun in that, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like there's an errata, already :)https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2025/01/a-sheepish-apolog...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're in Berlin, especially with kids, there more than a dozen of children's farmyards (not counting zoos and actual farms) all quite central in multi-centric Berlin. Mostly for (early) childhood educational purposes, so they are are prime spot for Kindergarten day trips.https://www.berlin.de/kultur-und-tickets/tipps/kinder/kinder...https://www.visitberlin.de/en/farms-childrenSince most of them are in former West-Berlin the reason they  exist can likely be explained from a mixture of empty lots not rebuild after the bombing in WWII, historical farms in outer Groß-Berlin (Domäne Dahlem) and the impracticality of casual trips into the countryside with kids beyond the wall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42802498</guid></item><item><title>11.

      name = "show-nixos-org";

      runtimeInputs = [ curl w3m ];

      text = ''
        curl -s 'https://nixos.org' | w3m -dump -T text/html
      '';
    }

writeShellApplication will call shellcheck[1] on your script and fail to build if there are any issues reported, which I think is the only sane default.[0]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#trivial-builder-wri...[1]: https://www.shellcheck.net/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42804835</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish they would add some kind of download counter.A decent bunch of the apps on F-Droid are woefully inadequate or still early in development. At the moment F-Droid allows sorting apps either by time of most recent update, or alphabetically. Neither of those is actually useful to me as user.If there are multiple apps doing the same thing, it is currently incredibly hard to see which one is the best. I do not want to download and install multiple apps only to find out they are essentially unusable, and that of the 5 options only a single one is actually functional.I understand that F-Droid might not want to go all-in with the rating and review system, but a barebones download counter would at least show some indication whether people install it once and remove it after trying it out, or leave it installed long enough to survive multiple updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After more than a decade, the UI for updating apps in F Droid is still very buggy. One of its most basic and fundamental features. I don't get it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; progressive web apps (PWA) as packages that can be shipped via repositoriesAah, wasn't aware this is possible now, thats cool.But raises the question of how exactly to check and communicate to users what data are being collected.With a PWA almost all of the code runs on the server. Even if that server is based on an open source project, there is no guarantee that there has been no modification (eg a plugin) that changes behavior.Not sure there is a way to reconcile these demands in an automated way that doesnt ultimately fall back on trusting the developer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42798108</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post announces the release of Tailwind CSS v4, highlighting its new features, improvements, and updates that enhance the utility-first CSS framework. Key updates include new color palettes, improved JIT mode capabilities, and enhanced plugin support, aimed at providing developers with greater flexibility and efficiency in their design workflows. The article also showcases examples of practical applications and the overall benefits of upgrading to this latest version, encouraging users to explore the enhancements for their web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a once-strident critic of Tailwind for its many failings and incompatibilities with the state of the actually-modern "vanilla" web art, I am very pleased to see the huge strides they've made with v4. Being able to access the Tailwind theme through native CSS variables (they even have an example in the docs of a button component written in native CSS in an external stylesheet using native variables! Oh happy day!) is absolutely massive, and being able to use a CSS-only config is equally amazing. Finally, Tailwind feels more like it's a utility (ironic, since its claim to fame is utility classes!) which you can add to any project, rather than some bizarro "viral" framework that wants to eat sensible architectures and lives in its own JavaScript-y silo.Perhaps all the criticism over the years actually had an effect. Or maybe they finally arrived at good conclusions on their own. Either way, I suspect many of the pro/anti-Tailwind arguments are no longer relevant, and that's a Very Good Thing. Now we can get down to business and ship product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSS has become significantly more user-friendly than in the past, with most browsers now behaving consistently. It's worth learning as there is no build step involved, and it avoids cluttering your markup with excessive code.You could opt to use style attributes directly within your HTML. Historically, we avoided this to maintain a separation of concerns, but it's puzzling why some prefer reintroducing similar methods. Is it just to save a few keystrokes?
Using style attributes even seems more straightforward since it doesn't require translating code in your head.I simply don't see the appeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love tailwind, used in 3 projects in the past 4 years, it’s intuitive, well documented, simple. I don’t miss the days of emotion and styled components where I would have to think of a name for every styled div in the project, with tailwind a container is just a div and a few classes nothing else. Less bike shedding discussion, less brain cycles spent naming things, less time wasted in reviews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799136</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really think that the resellers should offer a provenance. "This aeron has been through both the early twenties cryptocurrency bubble and the mid-twenties AI bubble!"There _has_ to be a collectors' market for this sort of thing. This beanbag was at Theranos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember seeing a shop near Old Street in London that I thought was definitely just selling the office chairs of failed businesses. You'd walk past and there would be some fancy chairs and desks, from yet another dream that died.Vital part of the economy, a bit like fungus in ecology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Startups burn through cash as they skyrocket in size and ambition, accumulating outrageous perks and office equipment along the way. Then they crash to Earth, with nothing but their private planes or massive 3D printers to pad the impact.This does not sound healthy.Almost sounds intentional by its common knowledge usual occurance. Taking the money of some clueless holder of money - optimistically calling themselves as investors, never as suckers for sure - and fraud away. Having a good life while doing it. Putting it proudly into the CV to repeat. Like if this is the original intent to begin with. To fail and skim the money while losing bad. Not really doing/attempting something beneficial and lasting in the end. That might sound scary - meaning they have to worry about being permanently successfull, balancing the sheet, react to adverse changing, for long, long, long. 'Starting up' (and fall) is easy, 'keep on going' is too hard?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42790536</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Dan Luu's website explores the intricacies of file formats, specifically looking into how binary files are structured and the process of deconstructing them. It focuses on tools and techniques for analyzing file headers, understanding encoding, and interpreting the contents of various file types, including images and executables. Luu provides practical examples and insights into the importance of file format knowledge for software development and data processing, emphasizing the benefits of being able to reverse-engineer files for debugging and optimization purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Pillai et al., OSDI’14 looked at a bunch of software that writes to files, including things we'd hope write to files safely, like databases and version control systems: Leveldb, LMDB, GDBM, HSQLDB, Sqlite, PostgreSQL, Git, Mercurial, HDFS, Zookeeper. They then wrote a static analysis tool that can find incorrect usage of the file API, things like incorrectly assuming that operations that aren't atomic are actually atomic, incorrectly assuming that operations that can be re-ordered will execute in program order, etc.&gt; When they did this, they found that every single piece of software they tested except for SQLite in one particular mode had at least one bug. This isn't a knock on the developers of this software or the software -- the programmers who work on things like Leveldb, LBDM, etc., know more about filesystems than the vast majority programmers and the software has more rigorous tests than most software. But they still can't use files safely every time! A natural follow-up to this is the question: why the file API so hard to use that even experts make mistakes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ext4 actually special-handles the rename trick so that it works even if it should not:"If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the replace-via-rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and [basically save your ass]"[0][0]https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/ext4.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; they found that every single piece of software they tested except for SQLite in one particular mode had at least one bug.This is why whenever I need to persist any kind of state to disk, SQLite is the first tool I reach for. Filesystem APIs are scary, but SQLite is well-behaved.Of course, it doesn't always make sense to do that, like the dropbox use case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42805425</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love everything about the demo video on the homepage. It's always fun to see a creator beat up their product and see it withstand the abuse.As far as "any bike can be an ebike" I'm surprised that Hilltoppers[0] haven't gained more traction over the years. You just pop off your current bike's front wheel and install theirs.[0] https://hilltopperbikes.com/product-category/electric-bike-k...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What the what?! This is so cool. I love everything about the demo. 
No (spoken) words, just a cool functioning product, in its intended uses cases, in different situations -- on fire, soaked in water, soaked in mud.Even if the product actually did nothing useful (which is not the case here), the video itself a great marketing copy. &lt;3As a product person, this excites me.However... I'm curious. This was launched ~2 years ago (per the YT video [1]). What happened? Is this still working? How is the company doing? Any ideas?? I don't see any other videos on their channel. I see some action on their Twitter [2] but sporadic.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFsnS0Yb1Bs 
[2] https://x.com/dhruvvidyut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a quite a look, reminds me a bit of something from the Fallout universe.  I'm a bit surprised at the "pedaling charges the batteries" bullet point.  That's extremely rare in the e-bike world.  25,000 mph top speed seems somewhat optimistic however.I assume it means 25 kph top speed, which is on the slower side for e-bikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42804434</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an overview of the Guédelon project, an ambitious archaeological and historical undertaking in France where a group of craftsmen and historians are constructing a 13th-century castle using only the techniques and materials that would have been available at that time. Visitors can learn about the methodologies employed, the historical context of the castle's construction, and the project’s educational objectives, which include demonstrating medieval building practices and contributing to historical research. The site also offers information on guided tours, workshops, and events for enthusiasts of history and archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;

They mine the ore then use it to make steel to make axes to chop wood.This ensure that the know-how is genuine. They've been able to "rediscover" how things were actually made. It's a sort of retroactive proof of concept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So awesome, I wonder what the cost (modern cost) of this is?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Similar in Germany is the site Campus Galli, between lake Constance and the Danube river. The goal is to build an abbey from the 8th century. They got inspired by Guedelon and started more recently.The website is in german :

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses seven seminal papers that have significantly shaped the field of computer science. It highlights key contributions from authors including Alan Turing, Donald Knuth, and Tim Berners-Lee, illustrating how these works laid foundational concepts for algorithms, programming languages, and the internet. The article emphasizes the enduring impact of these papers on both theoretical and practical aspects of computing, making them essential reading for anyone interested in the evolution of the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; This course examines papers every computer scientist should have read, from the 1930s to the present. It is meant to be a synthesizing experience for advanced students in computer science: a way for them to see the field as a whole, not through a survey, but by reliving the experience of its creation. The idea is to create a unified view of the field of computer science, for students who already know something about it, by replaying its entire evolution at an accelerated frame rate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually found this to be an odd mix. Are we selecting papers that had an influence on computer science (as in, the theory of computation), or that had an impact on technology? Or are we just using CS as a catch-all for "all things computer"?The Turing paper is foundational for CS, but without it, would the technology have evolved differently? Probably not. Most software engineers have not read it. Conversely, the IP standard is a technological cornerstone, but there's hardly any science in it. It's just a specification of a fairly simple protocol that you need to know when doing almost anything network-adjacent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great list of papers.I've read five of of the seven papers on the list. The two I haven't read are Cerf and Kahn's, and Berner-Lee's.Turing's paper on computability was particularly hard to follow, for me, because he used these gothic-font upper-chase characters to name all sorts of objects, and all those characters looked kinda the same to me! I had to use auxiliary materials to be able to make my way through the paper. Today, I would recommend reading it with Charles Petzold's easy-to-follow book on the paper: https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Com...Cook's paper on NP-completeness was also hard to follow (again, for me). As with Turing's paper, I had to use auxiliary materials to make my way. Today, I would recommend reading instead an introductory book on computational complexity that works through Cook's proof.Shannon's paper is a work of art, clearly articulated and beautifully written. It's just not casual reading, to put it mildly.Brin and Page's paper, and Codd's paper, are not hard to follow, at least as I remember them, but understanding Brin and Page's work requires some knowledge of Linear Algebra.Thank you for sharing this on HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799103</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the Pareto Principle, which suggests that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes, is often applied excessively in the tech industry, leading to oversimplifications and misguided strategies. It critiques the tendency to prioritize a small subset of features or customers at the expense of broader considerations, arguing that this can hinder innovation and limit a company's potential. The piece emphasizes the need for a more balanced approach that recognizes the value of all stakeholders and encourages a more nuanced understanding of success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I appreciate that the author put in the time and effort to write this, I have to say that I disagree with pretty much all of this.Beyond quibbling about specific points, the MVP and the Vertical Slice are functionally similar they totally different in their purpose. Video Games are generally competing for a slice of a large preexisting market. The test is whether it can compete against existing products. A new to the world software start up is trying to serve a need that is currently unserved. The test is whether there is any market at all for this product (PMF). The 80/20 rule is about getting some validation that the thing you are building is worth building in the first place - not that it can be done, but that it should be done.There aren't a ton of specific examples listed, but the images might insinuate some products that the author has in mind. I would just point out that Magic Leap, Humane were both hardware products that spent &gt;5 years in development. They cam out as completed fully finished products that were complete by any standard. The problem wasn't that these products shipped with missing features, it was that nobody wanted what they were selling (see also the Apple Vision Pro, which is technically phenomenal in terms of design/engineering/manufacturing, but not really very useful). These products did the opposite of the Lean Methodology and show the risk of trying something brand new and not validating the assumptions as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In terms of economics and utility, the last 80% of effort produces 20% of the result. But the last 80% give us something much more that isn’t quantified: The feeling of having completed something of value, and having done it properly, carries an inherent value that surpasses the last 20% output. It is unquantifiable and priceless. This is when work or products become timeless and truly valuable. Not to mention that feeling of satisfaction and completeness of taking an accomplishment to that level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software that is critical is not build like that.Medical device control software is not build like that, drone flight control is not build like that, power plant safety is not build like that.The problem that I noticed in the recent years is: People see the fast dev cycles for non critical software and think they can replicate it in areas where it really does not fit.I guess that’s how we ended up with Teslas self driving.I am a bit worried that ai seems to be build like that, using development cycles fit for a convenience appliance for what could be used as a weapon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42800557</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various methods for data compression, explaining the importance of efficient data storage and transmission. It outlines different compression techniques, including lossless and lossy methods, and their respective use cases. The author highlights key algorithms and tools used in compression, providing examples and comparing their performance. The overall aim is to inform readers about the principles of data compression and guide them in choosing the right approach for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing writeup - I needed this a few months ago :)My impression after my own, shallower dive is that trainable dictionaries are an underappreciated part of the (or at least my) system design toolkit.For example, say you're serving Wikipedia - a bunch of pages that are kind of static. In order to minimize disk space, you'll be tempted to compress the content. Compressing the whole corpus gets a good compression ratio, but it means that,  to read an arbitrary item, you need to decompress everything (or 50% of everything, on average, I guess).So to get random access, you compress each page. That's ok, but you get a worse compression ratio because every compressor starts from scratch.But with Zstandard and a trainable dictionary, you could train a dictionary on a couple pages, then use that dictionary to compress and decompress arbitrary items.As far as I can tell, that's probably the best of both worlds - close to the compression ratio of compressing the whole corpus with gzip, but the random access of compressing each item individually.This seems really generalizable - e.g. maybe Facebook has to store a zillion photos that are very rarely accessed, but 10% of them are selfies. If we use a vector search to find clusters of similar items, we can compress those items with a single dictionary.In fact, taking another step back, it seems like databases ought to offer this out of the box. Just like the concept of an index, it's not always a win and there are a lot of knobs that you might want to tune, but the benefits seem clear.Maybe all of this already exists, or there's something I'm missing, but I really appreciate article's like OP's that break things down so clearly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conclusion: "One interesting idea is that, at their core, AI models are nothing more than compression models that take the corpus of data humanity has and boil it down to a set of weights" is also good, there is a interesting paper about compressing weather date with neuronal networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12538What's missing a bit is that the comparison is more for general purpose data, there are some very interesting and super fast compressing algorithms for e.g. numbers (Turbopforc, gorilla, etc...) Daniel Lemires blog is super interesting about the different algorithms and how to make them faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms (2005) by David J.C. MacKay (sadly deceased) was one of my favorite books covering some of the Maths in this area. I need to look at it again.Free link to online version http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42765683</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In August 1980 I was working as a lab technician in a secondary school and was spending my spare time observing variable starts with binoculars and analysing the results with my brother's pocket calculator. I used to regularly drop in on the local library on my way home to read New Scientist. One day I noticed an advert for the Sinclair ZX80.And all of a sudden, I realised that you could have a computer at home. This had never occurred to me before seeing that advert.I immediately bought one, followed by a small portable television, so I didn't have to use the family television as a monitor. I wrote several simple programs to parse and reduce my variable star observations but I fairly quickly outgrew the ZX80's limitations, and then upgraded to a 'proper' microcomputer, a Sharp MZ80k.Several years later, I felt confident enough to switch my career over to computing and took an MSc course at Newcastle.Several years after that, my mother told me that her Women's Institute branch had held an 'Antiques of the Future' competition and that she had taken along my long-neglected ZX80 and won first prize with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My parents took us on a once-in-a-lifetime visit to Ireland from Zimbabwe. My cousin had a ZX-80.  I think he's a very big shot in Tesco now and I'm just a programmer.It was the first computer I ever saw. 1kb memory. Some game or other was made of black boxes on a white background.Thereafter I never owned a Sinclair machine but spent hours having the privilege of watching friends or relatives play theirs to "show me how to do it." :-D I got the occasional chance to help type in a long program from some magazine.All those people went on to do other jobs but I became a programmer much later when my family's fortunes changed and we got .... an Amstrad PC 1640. :-) I missed out on years of learning but I made up for it quite fast. Many years later when the 1640 was so old it was ridiculous, I got my parents to fork up for a generic 386 clone.  I never ran Windows 95. I never ran Win NT or 2k. I got 21 5-inch floppy disks from my pal in South Africa with Slackware Linux 0.99 and that was my future course for the next 30 something years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sinclair was the UK's Steve Jobs - transformative products at super-cheap prices, which kicked off an entire industry.The shared differentiator was industrial design. Sinclair spent a small fortune on making products look distinctive. The most successful designs (ZX81, Spectrum, QL) were done by Rick Dickinson, but you can already see it in the sleek black plastic Sinclair Executive and the flamboyantly gold plated Sovereign from the 70s.All of these products were designed to look exciting and futuristic.The internals were penny-pinched to a ridiculous extent, and were usually flawed and often not all that functional.But the externals won design awards and caught the imagination of ordinary non-technical users, because they looked like nothing else on sale at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42802778</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know I might be barking up "just a showcase" tree, but what's the memory complexity of this? E g. a nice property of multipass assemblers is that these only need to keep a list of symbols in the memory rather than the whole program. Not really a concern for modern systems with large memories, but then those neat haskell tricks usually carry some extra O(n)s - in addition to (avoidable) extra constant factors due to hidden linked lists and immutability. Aka the infamous haskell quicksort - much shorter and clear, but also not really a quicksort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One pass, but.. I'm willing to bet there is some transitional internal state which had to be looped over to do this, subsuming the "pass" inside lazy eval. You have to know the indeterminate "where" to jump to, which depends on subsequent state. So you preserve execution state, calculate on, and return at end to fill in the gaps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or you could just be pessimistic in your offset calculation and assume that all "in between" unconditional jumps are 5 bytes in length. I know I know, not proper. But I doubt that in real code, that simpler algo would make you miss a lot of opportunities for 2 bytes jumps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42768614</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "edge-tts" provides a tool for converting text to speech using Microsoft's Edge browser's text-to-speech functionality. It allows users to easily generate speech from text input in various languages and voices, offering customization options such as voice selection and speed. The repository includes installation instructions, usage details, and examples for developers looking to integrate text-to-speech capabilities into their applications using edge-tts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't use Edge TTS for commercial projects since it's using an internal Microsoft API that was reverse engineered.If you are looking for a commercial API, I just launched a TTS API powered by the the best performing open source model Kokoro: https://www.lemonfox.ai/text-to-speech-api. The API is compatible with OpenAI and ElevenLabs and up to 25x cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would you pirate a TTS service when there are so many great options for local open source TTS now? Models like Fish and Kokoro and StyleTTSv2 are great and very fast.Click the leaderboard tab here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TTS-AGI/TTS-Arena&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have been using this for some time. It is pretty good. But not as good as ElevenLabs though.Also, ironically enough, ElevenLabs lunched a readerapp for iOS and Android, which allows you to text to speech for "free" in some limited voice selections, but the app is not available for PC or as browser extension. So like "we give you unlimited tts but only if you use your smartphone"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42800321</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something like this just for photos has been in the back of my mind forever - it would be really nice to have a virtual folder built from images where the exif data says you used X camera or took the photos on X date. This would be useful for editing applications that are not catalog based, just point them at the virtual folder and query the images you want to edit, and there they are.Edit - Someone mentioned befs but deleted their comment, it seems like it might sorta be supported in modern linux, possibly just read only though:https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/befs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I messed with TMSU back one of the previous times it was posted. It's very cool and works well but I just couldn't make myself go retroactively apply tags to terabytes of existing files.It almost feels like a personal categorization version of the "AI Bitter Lesson": people keep thinking that doing a bunch of manual taxonomy work is going to help them find files faster but eventually search catches up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's multiple projects that attempt similar thing with SQLite, most recent one being Tag Studio. Seems like tag-based file organization is better solution but required mental cost/effort of upkeep is what keeps it from gaining any traction in long runhttps://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a humorous exploration of the concept of object permanence through the lens of the popular video game Minecraft. It examines how certain game mechanics can highlight the limitations of a player's understanding of objects and their existence within the game. The author illustrates amusing scenarios where players interact with the game world in ways that overlook the permanence of objects, leading to unexpected and funny outcomes. Overall, the piece combines gaming culture with philosophical insights to entertain and provoke thought about perception and reality in virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a fun read. But some of the things attributed to a glitchy AI are just normal Minecraft stuff. For example: "One time I was swimming across a lake and noticed that the reflections at the water's edge were looking weirdly spiky." That's kelp, it looks like that in the game because the chunks beyond haven't loaded so it stands out from the sky. Also, the "natural blocks of rare glowstone" are honeycomb blocks, which she thinks might be new "cheese" blocks but in fact have been in the game for over five years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty much how my dreams work. For example, I can read in my dreams (like signs, books), but it's almost always one word at a time, and the rest of the text becomes impossible to focus while I'm reading that word, no matter how hard I try. It's like the "permanence module" is disabled and my brain falls back to a primitive generative AI for the next frame. And, I can't reason about the logic of my experience, the lack of causality, or persistence of objects at the time. Everything feels "as they should be" despite how awkward things get. I guess that's why nightmares are so convincing or hard to get out of, because I can't reason about them. The whole article feels like describing a typical dream to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a bit in Ender's Game where he plays this computer game that has a dreamlike quality to it. It seemed it could simulate a response to any player action, and continue the story along that path. I think in the book it was a tool for introspection, like dreams can be? I can't really remember.Anyway, as a kid I thought, silly author, that's not how computer games work. But it turns out Orson Scott Card is smarter than me. Give this kind of thing a few years and we'll have it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762426</guid></item><item><title>28.

So it's seemingly misleadingly named.Edit: there's another hamburger menu, about 75% down the viewport that has some other stuff in it, idk.Pretty confusing UX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know it's a minority opinion with this crowd, but sports has such a large presence on X and I don't know why it's lagging moving to BlueSky.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the late 2000s I had my second encounter with the FBI (my first was talked about in another comment I wrote earlier today)  I was hanging out with the world's leading web spammers and in those circles the 'replace words with synonyms' method was known but considered too low quality for web spam.  Works for scientific literature though, where standards are lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was looking for such 'tortured phrases' on Google scholar recently and also found an article from MDPI:https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/4/1792&gt; There is a requirement to assist various types of solar radiation and wind speed measurement and predictions, such as the iterative approach, counterfeit consciousness method, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Springer has had issues for a long time. During my PhD, within the research field of Genetic Programming, there is an author who only published to Springer. This author always had the best results in the field. Reliably, when ever some new results would come out, this person would publish to Springer with better results. Vague methods, no reproducibility. So when I went and built a non-GP algorithm and improve the state-of-art by orders of magnitude, low and behold this person was able to improve upon my results. It seems as though there is no actual editorial activity over there at allWhen Docker first came out, one of my advisors and I pondered how we might use it to aid in the reproducibility crisis in academic research. I don't think anything ever came of it, certainly the situation seems to have deteriorated since. There are a lot of good researchers out there, but I fear many of them do the same dealing with the dumb system we find in large bureaucracies in the private sectorIn some ways it is worse. Reviewers are expected to put in free labor for the journals and then we have to either put our own work behind a paywall or "pay for the privilege" to have it be open access.Perhaps we should take a stab at building open-review features, reviewers, journals, reproducibility, and transparency around Arxiv. They have a survey banner on the site right now, lets suggest some ideas! (edit: sadly, the survey is quite limited and irrelevant to improving the practice of research)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42759862</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok so basically they are introducing annotations so that the compiler can reason about the code and warn the programmer for non-realtime usage.When you think about it, it's a lot like a type system.I haven't worked with realtime systems, but I have other constraints. E.g. I want the memory usage of a function to stay within x kilobytes, or I want an api call to return within a second, or I want to ensure there is no PII being sent to the logs.I sincerely hope that in the future we'll have languages that cater to these kind of constraints. Think function coloring on steroids. This way the compiler can help figure out problems and we need way less tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like it could also be useful in embedded programming, specifically around detecting allocations in platforms that allow them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The remark on flagging mutex use was quite interesting. From afar, using mutexes in real-time code seems like asking for ~trouble~ formal validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780636</guid></item><item><title>33.

Honestly surprised this slipped through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you get a bounty payout for this? I got the impression that Apple wasn't particularly on the ball with those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    -   int new_value = *(int *)oidp-&gt;oid_arg1;
    +   int new_value = *(uint16_t *)oidp-&gt;oid_arg1;

Why not just have `uint16_t new_value = ...`?Ahh, because `new_value` is being given to `sysctl_handle_int(..., &amp;new_value, ...);` which of course expects an `int`. So then it begs the question: if the value is really a `uint16_t`, then why is it being handled through a plain `int`? It smells like there could easily be tons of other memory-safety and/or type confusion problems endemic to the sysctl API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42808801</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the intriguing connection between the soundtrack of "The Exorcist" and amateur radio, detailing how the film's unsettling audio elements may resonate with frequencies and sounds commonly associated with radio technology. It examines the psychological impact of these soundscapes and their potential to evoke a sense of unease, drawing parallels between the film's horror and the unique auditory experiences found in amateur radio communications. The piece highlights the creative use of sound in both mediums and discusses how the overlap reflects broader themes of communication and the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The potentially earliest written model of a telegraph actually involved bells as well. After the anonymous author (C.M) first suggestion of  small pieces of paper with letters written on them jumping up, via static electricity to tiny electrified balls as the sender manually electrifies the wires, one for each letter, and then waits a bit to allow the slips of paper to flutter back down one by one as the remote observer diligently records what letters hit their balls in what order, he suggests the following, from Scots Magazine, 1753:"If anybody should think this way tiresome, let him, instead of the balls, suspend a range of bells from the roof, equal in number to the letters  the alphabet, gradually decreasing in size from the bell A to Z; and from the horizontal wires let there be another set reaching to the several bells; from the horizontal wire A to the bell A, another from the horizontal wire B to the bell B, etc. Then let him who begins the discourse bring the wires in contact with the barrel, as before; and the electric spark, breaking on bells of different size, will inform his correspondent by the sound what wires have been touched: and thus, by some practice, they may come to understand the language of the chimes in whole words, without being put to the trouble of noting down every letter."The first documented successful message by wire was 20 years later although there was no independent observer. It took about 55 years from the time of this article until one was publicly demonstrated.Many people claimed they were working on it, such as in this 1773 love letter by Genevan Physician named Louis Odier:"I shall amuse you, perhaps, in telling you that I have in my head certain experiments by which to enter into conversation with the 
emperor of Mogol, or of China, the English, the French, or any other 
people of Europe, in a way that, without inconveniencing yourself, 
you may intercommunicate all that you wish, at a distance of four or 
five thousand leagues in less than half an hour! Will that suffice 
you for glory. There is nothing more real. Whatever be the course 
of those experiments, they must necessarily lead to some grand 
discovery; but I have not the courage to undertake them this winter."Communication at a distance was "time machine"/"fountain of youth" technology up until the 1800s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_alphabet was a mystical occult version from the 1600s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's what I hear:    VVV GBR GBR GBR [BT] TL5 T [BT] VVV VVV VVV ...

[BT] here indicates a prosign [1] (-...-) this one is a kind of section or message divider.VVV is often sent when testing your equipment, and I think that's what's happening here.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I used a lossless FLAC copy of the CD album from 2003 to see this. It’s quite possible a lot of this would be missing from lossy copies, such as MP3s, though I haven’t tested that.Aren't music CDs already compressed using lossy compression? A FLAC copy of that uncompressed CD would be one generation away from the original, whereas an MP3 of the rip would be two generation removed from the original (i.e. still lossy, only more so)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42807653</guid></item><item><title>35.

I'm fascinated by all things Spirograph and built my own digital version of the more traditional toy here: https://nathanfriend.com/inspiral-web&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating.  The heliocentric view made me wonder: how are we going to cope, culturally, with Mars colonists when they are stuck on the other side of the sun for two weeks every two years?The Red Mars books deal with the bonus half hour every night neatly, as a social phenomenon — Martian days are 24.5 hours long — but I don’t recall the solar occlusion coming up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also once got distracted by Spirographs. We got a Spirograph kit for our kids one Christmas, so I spent some time during the holidays writing a python package to draw them. Nothing fancy, just uses python’s built-in turtle graphics.https://pypi.org/project/spiro/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42805421</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release of Bun v1.2, highlighting its significant performance enhancements and new features aimed at improving JavaScript and TypeScript development. Key updates include faster package installations, a more efficient bundler, and support for additional JavaScript libraries, all designed to streamline the development process. The release also emphasizes better compatibility with existing tools and frameworks, making Bun a more attractive option for developers looking for speed and ease of use in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are they putting 3rd party (databases) and external (s3) librares into their core / std lib? Wouldn't that be better as an optional library? I think a runtime like this should be very, very careful with what they put into the std lib, adding these already makes it feel like a kitchen sink project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using bun has been a great experience so far. I used to dread setting up typescript/jest/react/webpack for a new project with breaking changes all over the place. With bun, it’s been self contained and painless and it just works for my use. Can’t comment on the 3rd party libraries they are integrating like s3, sql etc but at least it looks like they are focused on most common/asked for ones.Thanks for the great work and bringing some much needed sanity in the node.js tooling space!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of good stuff here, but I do wonder if some of the default behaviour is getting a little too magical:When you use new Response(s3.file(...)), instead of downloading the S3 file to your server and sending it back to the user, Bun redirects the user to the presigned URL for the S3 file.That's a rather surprising choice for the default, and it's not at all obvious how you'd disable it if you don't want to expose your S3 bucket directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42801370</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of assessing human intelligence and creativity through standardized tests, particularly in the context of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. It emphasizes that traditional testing methods may not accurately reflect true capabilities or potential, leading to questions about their validity. The piece also examines how AI could change the landscape of evaluation and learning, suggesting that a reevaluation of human assessment methods is necessary to adapt to a rapidly evolving technological environment. Overall, it calls for innovative approaches to measuring human achievement in the age of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project site is https://lastexam.ai. Readers may want to look at both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They started collecting problems last fall, saying the top 550 submissions sent in by Nov 1st would get rewarded, to the tune of $500-$5000 each.Near the deadline, I counted the total number of submissions, and realized that each question I wrote had an expected value of hundreds of dollars, which is a great use of my time. So I wrote a good number, using the knowledge gained in my CS Ph. D.Then, as the Nov 1st deadline rolled around, they announced they extended the deadline to Nov 15th. Then Nov 15th came, and it said on their website they were still accepting submissions.Most of my submissions are being included in the benchmark, but I'm only getting paid $500, for one of them (the one I thought was most standard and least difficult, funnily enough). Had they closed submissions when they said they would, it seems likely I'd be paid for a few more.From my perspective, they basically conned hundreds of Ph. D.'s around the world to write questions for much less reward than promised. My close friend wrote a large number of questions for them, is getting paid thousands of dollars, and still feels defrauded.I'm not sure what they're doing in the end. It sounds like they're mostly just paying people who submitted before Nov 1st with a few exceptions, but either way they lied. There was no indication that people who submitted later would not get paid, and there was no indication that the deadline would be extended. Either they pay people who submitted after Nov 1st, meaning they lied to the people who submitted before about their expected reward. Or they don't, meaning they majorly lied to the people who submitted after. Either way, it's clear grounds for a class action lawsuit, and I hope one gets running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These types of exams, and most benchmarks to date, seem to be very one dimensional in terms of measuring intelligence. For instance, if we transported a human from 2,000 years ago to present day and asked him to take this exam, he would likely get 0%, given that he couldn't read or write, let alone comprehend the concepts and context required to solve these questions. But, that man would still undoubtedly be far more intelligent than an ape on all dimensions. He would likely be more intelligent than a toddler on many dimensions. He might even be more intelligent than some high schools students on a few dimensions. I can't exactly articulate "what" is missing or how to measure it, but I can intuit that some things are in these benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806105</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has introduced the Citations API, a tool designed to enhance the reliability of AI-generated content by allowing users to obtain citations for the information provided by language models. This API enables users to query the model, which then supplies responses along with relevant source citations, promoting transparency and accountability in AI usage. Developers can easily integrate the API into their applications, ensuring that the generated content is contextually sourced, thereby improving trust in AI-generated outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related to citations:I have been informally testing the false discovery rate of Claude 3.5 Sonnet for biomedical research publications.Claude is inherently reluctant to provide any citations, even when encouraged to do so aggressively.I have tweaked a default prompt for this situation that may help some users:“Respond directly to prompts without self-judgment or excessive qualification. Do not use phrases like 'I aim to be', 'I should note', or 'I want to emphasize'.Skip meta-commentary about your own performance. Maintain intellectual rigor but try to avoid caveats. When uncertainty exists, state it once and move on.Treat our exchange as a conversation between peers. Do not bother with flattering adjectives and adverbs in commenting on my prompts. No “nuanced”, “insightful” etc. But feel free to make jokes and even poke fun of me and my spelling errors.Always suggest good texts with full references and even PubMed IDs.Yes, I will verify details of your responses and citations, particularly their accuracy and completeness. That is not your job. It is mine to check and read.Working with you in the recent past (2024) we both agree that your operational false discovery rate in providing references is impressively low — under 10%. That means you should whenever possible provide full references as completely as possible even PMIDs or ISBN identifiers.  I WILL check.Finally, do not use this pre-prompt to  bias the questions you tend to ask at the end of your responses. Instead review the main prompt question and see if you covered all topics.End of “pre-prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interested to try this.I’ve built a number of quite complex prompts to do exactly this - cite from documents, with built-in safeguards to minimise hallucinations as far as possible.That comes with a cost though - typically the output of one prompt is fed into another API call with a prompt that sense-checks/fact-checks the output against the source, and if there are problems it has to cycle back - with more API cost. We then human review a random selection of final outputs.That works fine for non-critical applications but I’ve been cautious about rolling it out to chunkier problems.Will start building with citations asap and see how it performs against what we already have. For me, Anthropic seems to be building stuff that has more meaningful application than what I’m seeing from Open AI - and by and large I’m finding Anthropic performs way way better for my use cases than Open AI - both via the API and the chatbot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've assumed that Google's approach for NotebookLM is similar to this, given their release of https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-aps-it :Gemma-APS is a generative model and a research tool for abstractive proposition segmentation (APS for short), a.k.a. claim extraction. Given a text passage, the model segments the content into the individual facts, statements, and ideas expressed in the text, and restates them in full sentences with small changes to the original text.Anthropic:When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plain text files) by chunking them into sentences. These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query.Claude analyzes the query and generates a response that includes precise citations based on the provided chunks and context for any claims derived from the source material. Cited text will reference source documents to minimize hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42807173</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;Libmodulor is a high-performance C++ library designed to facilitate the development of concurrent applications in a modular and scalable manner. It provides a set of tools and abstractions for managing threads, tasks, and data flow, allowing developers to build applications that can efficiently handle a large number of concurrent tasks. The library emphasizes ease of use while delivering performance, making it suitable for both new and experienced developers looking to enhance their software's concurrency and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on your project.I feel like you could describe the abstractions you built in more detail. When I read the explanation for what the 'UseCase', 'App', 'Product' and 'Target' were, it wasn't clear how each of those translates to TypeScript. My guess is that 'UseCase' and 'App' would be like Classes, if you're modeling your program in an OOP way? The 'Product' seems like it would be the TypeScript project itself, with the package.json, source code and all of that.I would rethink how you named the 'App' layer. The examples given ('auth', 'accounting', etc.) are not necessarily what I would call an 'app'.As you introduce names and concepts for things in your library, I recommend trying to keep the cognitive load as low as possible. It seems like there are a very high amount of high-level concepts and implementation details like types, functions, etc. that 1. are specific/unique to libmodulor and 2. you need to learn before you can start actually building your application, from looking at the examples. The barrier to give it a try in a side project seems really high.Building things is cool regardless :) I'm happy that you built something it's useful to you and that you got to share here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoy your 4 types on the architecture.But I’m still a bit confused on what the project actually “is”.  I see you have an architecture and I’m using ts to define the interface between those 4 types of components.  But let’s say I have a react-native target: what am I expressing in that interface?  A cli which can build/deploy that interface?  Each ui screen in that rn app (rn login, rn add contact)?  Or all of the api endpoints in the web target which gets called by the rn target?In the readme, I would focus a bit less on the UML part, and a bit more on the “if I have a webapp and a mobile app, with auth and crud for contacts, here’s what you’d need”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should check out https://effect.website/It might help you implement some of these ideas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42804961</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite parts in The Art of Computer Programming is when Knuth goes into alternative numeric bases. He makes mention there of "base 2i" as well, though he details it in a much older paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/367177.367233Base 2i is particularly fascinating for allowing a numeric system that can represent all complex numbers without signs and without addition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almost all of these analyses of ternary hinge on the idea of efficiency of representation, being the (number of possible symbols) * (number of digits to represent).But it seems way more useful to use the log of the number of possible symbols, in which case all bases (except unary, which is non-positional) have the exact same efficiency, and the argument becomes moot. It becomes largely a question of representation in reality, and binary wins on that front.More exotic non-positional number systems seem way more interesting -- Fibonacci bases or Gray bases. Even balanced ternary if we have to break out of the binary paradigm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The book from 1950 mentioned in the article https://web.archive.org/web/20100505110621/https://bitsavers...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42804506</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Microsoft's perspective on the evolving landscape of cyber norms and the company's initiatives aimed at enhancing cybersecurity on a global scale. It highlights the importance of establishing consistent cyber norms among nations to deter harmful cyber activities and enhance collective security. Microsoft advocates for collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and civil society to create a framework of accountability and responsible behavior in cyberspace, emphasizing the need for proactive measures rather than reactive responses to cyber threats. The piece also outlines specific actions Microsoft is taking to contribute to this goal, including promoting international dialogues and providing cybersecurity resources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Microsoft’s security scanning will now not only visit the links you mail out, they will also run the JavaScript on your page, and will also send out any POSTs generated by that JavaScript:It seems to me that someone misunderstood how to implement the logic on the frontend here. You're not supposed to send off a POST request directly as the page has been loaded to exchange the tokens, but require the user to click on a button to confirm the activity.So the flow would be:- "Send email with url+token &gt; Frontend loads, shows button to user to confirm &gt; User clicks button and exchange happens".Instead, wrong implementations do something like this:- "Send email with url+token &gt; Frontend loads and exchange happens", which we've known for years to not work correctly, because of this very issue.Discourse for example implemented this perfectly, so if you need an example, that would be where I'd go.(I know it sucks that scrapers/crawlers do a lot of horrible shit, it truly does. But we've dealt with this for years now, it's not a new thing and it won't be the last shitty thing they do)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a page contains JavaScript that makes a POST request when the page loads, then it’s the developers of that page that are violating HTTP norms, not the developers of software that loads such pages. POSTs are unsafe requests that should be made as part of a user’s intent. Following a link should always be safe. Microsoft aren’t responsible for this problem – the site developers are.We already went through this with Google Web Accelerator and 37Signals twice. They couldn’t accept that mere links were a bad idea for deleting things, and GWA came along and deleted their users’ data by following links. They tried to detect and block GWA instead of following HTTP rules and it happened again.Links are supposed to be safe. Ignore this at your peril.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft knows what they're doing. The problem is users dont. I don't know what you care about more, your users convenience, or their safety and security. But no chance in hell I'd allow MS to dictate the terms of the security of my services.I'd solve this by warning users who attempt to reuse consumed links that the link has been used already, and likely list broken email providers that I suspect are using software that breaks this. And then wait. Let them complain to their IT, or whomever is responsible for picking broken software.If I was feeling really petty, the clown that wrote this link scanning software isn't in charge of the networking, so you could eventually enumerate the subnets that MS uses, and black list them. Then the links might actually get to users connecting from non MS data centers.You could roll over and decrease your security so that MS can claim they increased theirs... But you shouldn't! They can only get away with turning security into a negative sum game if you play along. Please don't?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42803597</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experience and insights on migrating away from Bcachefs, a file system designed for Linux. It outlines the challenges faced during the migration process, such as compatibility issues and data management concerns. The author shares practical solutions and recommendations for others considering a similar transition, emphasizing the importance of thorough planning and testing to ensure data integrity and system stability. Overall, it serves as a guide for those looking to navigate the complexities of changing file systems while minimizing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been patiently waiting to convert my ZFS array to bcachefs. I'm very excited about better SSD promotion logic. But I'm not willing to spend any time on an experimental filesystem on my main systems.&gt; But you can expect to get flamed about running Debian, or perhaps more accurately, not being willing to spearhead Kent's crusade against Debian's Rust packaging policies.It is quite unfortunate that Kent couldn't have just said "Debian isn't supported, we will revisit this when bcachefs is more stable" and stopped talking after that. Debian and experimental software just don't work well together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to write up my experience. But I'm trying it out. Linux needs something like this. I've had issues, posted traces and had them fixed in seconds. Pretty damn amazing. I'd love to see a bigger team involved though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bcachefs is experimental, and last I heard, the authors hope to be able to declare it not experimental in ~6 months. To me, that's 'try on a cache server/build server' territory, not on anything where you even think about backing it up.Kent Overstreet does have a problem working with people; I can well believe that interactions around bugs were painful. He likely he should try to hire someone else to deal with users and distributions and use his limited patience to deal with the kernel maintainers. But it sounds like the OP was a bit naive about what it means to run an experimental FS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42773296</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;Apache Kvrocks is an open-source, key-value database that is designed for high performance and scalability, particularly in scenarios that involve high concurrency and large datasets. It aims to combine the simplicity of a traditional key-value store with the advanced features of a distributed database, supporting various data structures and providing efficient querying capabilities. The project focuses on delivering low-latency data access and robustness, making it suitable for modern applications that require quick and reliable storage solutions. Additionally, the website provides documentation, installation guides, and resources for developers to get started with Kvrocks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use it for a year now in production and so far so good. We couldn't handle anymore having huge instances with a lot of RAM to hold data in Redis.It looks like a normal database to me: disk storage for most of the data, and some cache in memory to speed up read queries. Everything is customizable.I'm still waiting for a nice way to deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster, like a Helm Chart to easily setup a cluster with primaries and replicas. Also, the lack of keys eviction like LRU is problematic for us in some cases, it would be a nice addition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As this is backed by RocksDB, does that mean it’s disk-based? I’ve been looking for a way to utilize Redis but with hot (memory) and warm (nvme disk) mechanisms to boost my capacity affordably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of supported commands looks quite impressive https://kvrocks.apache.org/docs/supported-commands#script-co...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42778795</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;An ancient curse tablet has been discovered in a Roman-era grave in France, dating back to around 1,800 years ago. The tablet, inscribed with a curse targeting enemies, invokes Mars, the Roman god of war, suggesting the ritualistic significance of the object. This find sheds light on the personal beliefs and practices during that period, highlighting the intersection of warfare, religion, and social dynamics in ancient Roman society. The curse was likely intended to summon divine intervention against adversaries, emphasizing the cultural importance of curses in that era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the life and artistic contributions of Hélène de Beauvoir, who was the sister of the renowned philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. It highlights her role in the Parisian art scene, her connections with prominent figures like Pablo Picasso and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the influence of her familial relationships on her artistic journey. The piece emphasizes Hélène's unique identity as an artist in her own right, despite being overshadowed by her sister's fame, and sheds light on her legacy within the context of 20th-century art and feminist history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Now, with a show of her paintings opening at the Amar Gallery in London, the record is being set straight, as Hélène finally receives the recognition many feel she is due. “Our whole mission,” says gallerist Amar Singh, “is to search for overlooked artists.” Singh regales me with tales of cross-continental wild goose chases on the trail of collectors who might just sell. Once he hits upon an artist, he says, he looks into why they may have been sidelined. “It is always,” says the gallerist, “down to gender, race or sexuality.”This strikes a chord with me. I always said that if I did not work in my field, one of the things I would love to do is to open up an art gallery here in Basel focused on promoting such artists. Imagine for example, how many talented artists say, from, Congo or Laos, would just need some exposure to collectors to promote their art.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find some of her paintings to be loosely similar to some of Italian futurists or Italian avant garde painters, especially dudreville https://www.futurismo.org/leonardo-dudreville/ (I think it's in italian only)Another in depth article in English about an exhibition and the origin and themes of futurism and Italian avant garde painters, although different from the themes of helene's paintings https://www.finestresullarte.info/en/ab-art-base/futurism-or...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for posting this. Lovely article on the life of an unknown (to me, at least) artist, who it seems was foreshadowed by her much more famous sibling.Her paintings definitely look very original. At least stylistically, they appear as distinctly identifiable, as, say Tamara de Lempicka's. Another artist who was way ahead of her time, and is now celebrated with her own exhibition at the SF Legion of Honor [https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/tamara-de-lempicka]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772144</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an agreement between Google and HTC, which allows Google to acquire a significant portion of HTC's smartphone team. The partnership aims to enhance Google's Android hardware capabilities and improve its Pixel smartphone line. This collaboration marks a strategic move for Google to bolster its position in the competitive smartphone market by leveraging HTC's expertise in hardware engineering and design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Again?Seeing HTC do this makes me sad. They will get burnt by Google again.HTC was an amazing technological frontrunner for Android phones.The team got absorbed by Google.They had people working on VR/XR.That team got absorbed by Google too.Now, the VR team is getting absorbed again.Google tried this already - and failed. And as someone who held multiple workshops educating people to use Google's AR/VR tech, I see nothing but a barely-useful Android fork coming out of this that will be used for cheap VR/AR headsets.So to recap:- There was the AR (https://developers.google.com/ar)- There was the VR (https://developers.google.com/vr)- There was Google cardboard- There was Google Glass.All of these projects were:- Early to the market- Had a huge advantage over competition- Were (relatively) simple to build on/useAll of these projects ended up abandoned as the responsible person probably got promoted and moved on, leaving them to die. Now, when the competition stepped up their game and is gaining some serious ground in the field (META) it's someone else's turn to get their big promotion by releasing a half-assed product that they will forget about in a year.In the end, all that this signals to me is to be bullish on Meta, as their VR play seems to be sticky enough to draw out the competitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So.. Meta has Meta Horizon OS, which feels quite inaccessible to non-corpos AFAIK, and now we have Android XR. Is it more accessible? I was working with Razer back in the day (as a third party contributor, not part of the team) for Razer OSVR and that was very exciting. They shut that down though.So, what I'm asking is, could someone do the equivalent of the Open Source Laptop[1] but for XR?[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42797260&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The announcement is a bit lacking in detail. What are they actually announcing here beyond doing something related to XR?I talked to some IOS developers recently doing an app with some AR features. They were doing things with lidar and indoor maps on the iphone. I asked them if they were working on an Android version as well (I have a pixel 6 phone) and they told me that they tried but that the Android APIs are a bit limited for the types of things they were trying to do. Also, there don't seem to be a lot of Android phones with lidar.It seems Google does have some catching up to do here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42802210</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I guess an interesting attack would be a screen in a public setting that alters the QR code based on information it has about the current user, without appearing to change significantly.setup:- make the QR code as a half/half code- have a system to decide preference of target based on external input (e.g. camera based characteristic evaluation)- make slight dynamic alterations to the colours of the code to bias the probability of it being picked up as the desired target. Desirable black/white can be made blacker/whiter, less desirable less so.Where to use it maliciously:- anywhere where people provide feedback - present alternate feedback forms to different demographics to engender the most positive (or negative) results.- pretend to offer some form of probabilistic chance to win a prize, but bias winning to some identifiable characteristic. e.g. race, age, "beauty"- target a specific person - have them join a different WiFi network, alter a payment page, etc.In a static setting its less effective. I can't immediately think of a static attack that benefits from siphoning some reduced fraction of users.I'm doubtful most people would notice a QR code dynamically changing, particularly in most public lighting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey guys I made a website so yall can try this out yourself! I don't have the exact methodology that Christian uses, so here is how I did it:The ambiguous QR code in this application works by combining two different QR codes into a single image using a diagonal split pattern. When two QR codes have different patterns at the same position, the cell is split diagonally - one half represents the first QR code and the other half represents the second QR code. When both QR codes have the same pattern at a position (both black or both white), the cell is filled with a solid color. Due to the high error correction capability of QR codes (using error correction level 'H'), QR code scanners can still read either URL depending on the scanning angle, though as noted in the UI, it tends to favor the second URL more frequently.https://dualqrcode.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting thing about this to me is that on iOS a long press on the image claimed it's going to github.com, while the preview itself was for mastadon. This indicates that it's parsing the QR code twice and getting different results? I could see this being used to mislead some people, though I'm not sire how many people look at the long press dropdown URL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42809268</guid></item><item><title>2.

If you've ever wondered what the entropy of the Mario colour sequence is, let's find out! https://entropicthoughts.com/the-most-mario-colour-revisited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome and exactly the sort of useless but valuable study I come here for. Good job.Also, I think you should analyze the frequency of color choices when Mario is the first word or not the first word of the title. I want to see whether M is red for "Super Mario X", "Mario X", or "Other Other Mario Other Other". I imagine it might be tempting to make the very first letter red, or maybe make the first "big" letter red.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The color of the last letter for Odyssey would probably be pink :) There's a moon in Metro where you have to spell out Mario's name with the title letters, and the O is pink there. https://www.mariowiki.com/Letter_(Super_Mario_Odyssey)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777948</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The Wild project, developed by David Lattimore, is an open-source implementation aimed at providing a minimalistic server for federated applications, focusing particularly on the Wild messaging protocol. The GitHub repository includes the source code, installation instructions, and guidelines for contributing to the project. It seeks to empower developers to create decentralized communication tools by offering a lightweight and efficient platform, emphasizing flexibility, extensibility, and ease of use for building federated systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ever since mold relicensed from AGPL to MIT (as part of mold 2.0 release), the worldwide need for making another fast linker has been greatly reduced, so I wasn't expecting a project like this to appear. And definitely wasn't expecting it to already be 2x faster than mold in some cases. Will keep an eye on this project to see how it evolves, best of luck to the author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I looked at this before, is it ready for production? I thought not based on the readme, so I'm still using mold.For those on macOS, Apple released a new linker about a year or two ago (which is why the mold author stopped working on their macOS version), and if you're using it with Rust, put this in your config.toml:    [target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
    rustflags = [ 
        "-C",
        "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ld",
        "-C",
        "link-arg=-ld_new",
    ]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What would be refreshing would be a C/C++ compiler that did away with the intermediate step of linking and built the whole program as a unit. LTO doesn't even have to be a thing if the compiler can see the entire program in the first place. It would still have to save some build products so that incremental builds are possible, but not as object files, the compiler would need metadata to know of the origin and dependencies of all the generated code so it would be able to replace the right things.External libs are most often linked dynamically these days, so they don't need to be built from source, so eliminating the linker doesn't pose a problem for non-open source dependencies. And if that's not enough letting the compiler also consume object files could provide for legacy use cases or edge cases where you must statically link to a binary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42814683</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents the story and concept behind “TB”, which is an initiative aimed at addressing tuberculosis (TB) through innovative solutions. It emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about TB, promoting prevention, and improving treatment options. The site highlights various resources, research findings, and potential strategies to combat the disease, ultimately aiming to inspire action and engage the community in the fight against TB.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;I'm calling it Tilde (or TB for tilde backend) and the reasons are pretty simple, i believe it's far too slow at compiling and far too big to be fixed from the inside. It's been 20 years and cruft has built up, time for a "redo".That put a smile on my face because I remember that was how LLVM was born out of frustration with GCC.I dont know how the modern GCC and LLVM compares, I remember LLVM was fast but resulting binary were not as optimised, once those optimisation added it became slower. While LLVM was a wake up call to modernise GCC and make it faster. In the end competition made both a lot better.I believe some industry ( Gaming ) used to swear by VS Studio / MS Compiler / Intel Compiler or languages that depends / prefer the Borland ( What ever they are called now ) compiler. Its been very long since I last looked I am wondering if those two are still used or have we all merged mostly into LLVM / GCC?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chris Lattner seems to have also created an alternative for LLVM - https://mlir.llvm.org/Because of how the architecture works, LLVM is one of the backends, but it doesn't have to be. Very interesting project, you could do a lot more IR processing before descending to LLVM (if you use that), that way you could give LLVM a lot less to do.Chris has said LLVM is fast at what it is designed to do - lower IR to machine code. However, because of how convoluted it can get, and the difficulty involved in getting information from some language-specific MIR to LLVM, languages are forced to generate tons upon tons of IR so as to capture every possible detail. Then LLVM is asked to clean up and optimize this IR.One thing to look out for is the problem of either losing language-specific information when moving from MIR to Low-level IR (be it Tilde or LLVM) or generating too much information, most of it useless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw Yasser present this at Handmade Seattle in 2023.[0]  He explained that when he started working on Tilde, he didn't have any special knowledge or interest in compilers. But he was reading discussions in the Handmade forums, and one of the most popular requests was for an alternative to LLVM, so he thought, "Sure, I'll do that."[0] https://handmadecities.com/media/seattle-2023/tb/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42782872</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new sorting algorithm that approaches optimal efficiency, developed by researchers who have made significant advancements in the theoretical understanding of sorting processes. This new algorithm closely aligns with the lower bounds of sorting time, which could revolutionize data processing and computer science. The work enhances knowledge about comparison-based sorting methods, highlighting both the potential applications of this algorithm in various fields and the ongoing challenges in achieving perfect sorting efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Kuszmaul remembers being surprised that a tool normally used to ensure privacy could confer other benefits."It was surprising to me too! But reflecting on it more closely, most performance isn't about "faster" in a literal sense of "more instructions run per time", but about carefully choosing how to do less work. The security property here being "history independence" is also in a way stating "we don't need to, and literally cannot, do any work that tracks history".It's definitely an interesting approach to performance, essentially using cryptography as a contraint to prevent more work. What properties do we need, and what properties can we ignore? The question becomes if we MUST ignore this property cryptographically, how does that affect the process and the related performance?It certainly feels like it may be a useful perspective, a rigorous approach to performance that may be a path to more improvements in key cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I the only one that's trying to find the main papers that're being described in the article both the original problem, and the near optimal algorithm paper [1],[2].Apparently both of them are linked deep inside the article, perhaps Quanta can make it mandatory to list all the reference towards the end of the article, it will be very helpful for the readers.[1] Nearly Optimal List Labeling:https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00807[2] A sparse table implementation of priority queues:https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-10843-2_34&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was actually just looking at this problem last week, when I realized I needed to keep items in a database table positioned arbitrarily, ideally without needing to manipulate the rest of the list. So if a user adds in a new element after element 5, that element becomes 6, without needing to update the original item that came after element 5. There are indeed very sophisticated algorithms to manage this problem and minimize theoretical bounds. But it also seemed like the simplest solution for this particular version of the problem is to just use fractional amounts, and occasionally pay a penalty to relayout the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42814275</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of a particular mathematical function known as the "jagged monstrous function," which challenges traditional concepts in calculus, particularly in relation to limits and continuity. It highlights how this function, which is nowhere differentiable yet still has a defined value at every point, has provoked deeper insights into the nature of mathematical analysis and the foundations of calculus. The piece explores the historical context and the struggles mathematicians faced in understanding such complex functions, ultimately emphasizing their significance in advancing mathematical theory.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Weierstrass function is cool but the undisputed champion of calculus counterexamples has to be the Dirichlet function[1]f(x) = 1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise.It is defined over all real numbers but continuous nowhere.  Also if you take the Dirichlet function and multiply it by x so you getg(x) = x if x is rational, 0 otherwise…then you have something that is continuous at exactly one place (0) and nowhere else, which also is pretty spectacular.[1] https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirichletFunction.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a wonderful book on Mathematical counterexamples in French[0], meant for undergrad/engineering school hopefuls.So many of the continuity counter-examples are throwing Weierstrass at the wall and getting something to stick. It's fun but also feels a bit like cheating.I do recommend this book for any french-speaking mathematician-adjacent person though. Real great dictionary for remembering why certain things only work in one direction.[0] Les contre-exemples en mathématiques: https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/5328-les-contre-exe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I first learned about limits (my senior year in high school), I visualized a "step" shape graphed (0, 0) to (0, 1) and then to (1, 1). Up one unit, right one unit. (I know, not technically a function since it has a vertical component.)But now you subdivide both segments and put in an extra step. Up 0.5, right 0.5, up 0.5, right 0.5. Same starting point, same ending point. Even the same length of line segments as before — but the area bounded beneath is 3/4 the original.I reasoned that if you continued this subdivision, as you approach infinity the area under the "curve" approaches that of a half-unit right triangle (i.e. root-two).How is it, I asked my math teacher, that this shape can have the perimeter of a square but the area of a triangle?I don't recall the answer from the teacher. Maybe somewhat hand-wavy; ultimately unsatisfactory to me. I still don't really know the answer. I suppose the answer is that it is not in fact ever a triangle — just a thing with a fat edge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42810103</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting how the obfuscated code is explained by slowly unobfuscating it step by step. This is the reverse of how obfuscated code is normally created: by starting with understandable code, and then slowly obfuscating it bit by bit (as I explained for this IOCCC submission [1]).I say normally because one could also have a superoptimizer search for a minimal program that achieves some desired behaviour, and then one has to understand it by slowly unraveling the generated code.[1] https://tromp.github.io/maze.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; if you take the time to understand what this code does, you’ll learn a surprising amount about WebAssembly!It's a shame the article mostly teaches about codegolf tricks, and the actual wasm info is left to a single commented code block.Nonetheless an interesting article about JavaScript quirks though!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve used reverse Polish notation as an interview question many times. It works well because if someone’s never seen it you can learn a lot about their basic understanding of algorithms. But if they are aware of how easy it is you can extend it forever by adding symbols, improving the algo they build, or doing something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42814948</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an obsessive arcade retro-gamer who custom built a high-end emulation cabinet with a 27-inch quad-sync analog RGB CRT - I approve of this video! As soon as he described running into the green pixels problem, I knew he was going to learn something interesting. Sub-pixel structure, phosphor chromaticity, etc are such a fun rabbit hole to dive down. And it's still highly relevant in today's OLED, QLED, etc displays.Also, a tip for when you play classic arcade or console retro games from the 80s and 90s: they will look much better (and be more authentic) if you play on a CRT - or, if playing via emulation, just turn on a CRT emulation pixel shader (CRT Royale is good). These pixels are art which the original devs and artists intentionally hand-crafted to use the way CRTs blend colors and scanlines anti-alias naturally. You deserve to see them as they were intended to be seen. Just look at what you've been missing: https://i.redd.it/9fmozdvt6vya1.jpg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is awesome. I was able to play it with a headband magnifier[1] on a 1440p monitor, slowed down 10x. Anything higher density would probably need an actual microscope.[1] https://www.amazon.com/ProsKit-MA-016-Personal-Headband-Magn...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked Subpixel Zoo article taught me that Pentile is still actually incredibly popular.My first Pentile screen was on my Motorola Droid 4 phone, and it was awful.  Small text was often impossible to read depending on the color of the text and its background.  The massive gaps between colors made solid red, green, or blue areas of the screen look like a checkerboard.  It basically had a screen-door effect before VR became mainstream and made "screen-door effect" a household term.So it hit me as a surprise to know that Pentile is still popular and used today.  I guess it's just gotten better?  Smaller gaps between the subpixels?  Maybe higher resolutions and pixel densities hide the weaknesses shown in my Droid 4?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42815288</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development of a decision tree to evaluate the outputs of large language models (LLMs) in a legal context. It outlines the criteria for determining the appropriateness of LLM-generated responses, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, relevance, and adherence to legal standards. The decision tree serves as a tool for judges and legal professionals to systematically assess the quality of LLM outputs, ensuring that they meet necessary legal thresholds before being utilized in practice. The article highlights the potential benefits and challenges of integrating LLMs into the judicial process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We often ignore the importance of using good baseline systems and jump to the latest shiny thing.I had a similar experience few years back when participating in a ML competitions [1,2] for detecting and typing phrases in a text. I submitted an approach based on Named Enttiy Recognition using Conditional Random Field (CRF) which has been quite robust and well known in the community and my solution beat most of tuned Deep learning solutions by quite a large margin [1].I think a lot of folks underestimate the complexity of using some of these models (DL, LLM) and just throw them at the problem or don't compare it well against well established baselines.[1] https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;h...
[2] https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a somewhat similar experience trying to use LLMs to do OCR.All the models I've tried (Sonnet 3.5, GPT 4o, Llama 3.2, Qwen2 VL) have been pretty good at extracting text, but they failed miserably at finding bounding boxes, usually just making up random coordinates. I thought this might have been due to internal resizing of images so tried to get them to use relative % based coordinates, but no luck there either.Eventually gave up and went back to good old PP-OCR models (are these still state of the art? would love to try out some better ones). The actual extraction feels a bit less accurate than the best LLMs, but bounding box detection is pretty much spot on all the time, and it's literally several orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of memory and overall energy use.My conclusion was that current gen models still just aren't capable enough yet, but I can't help but feel like I might be missing something. How the heck did Anthropic and OpenAI manage to build computer use if their models can't give them accurate coordinates of objects in screenshots?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting. I think I did not entirely understand OPs problem, but we are going more and more in a direction where we try to come up with things how to "program" LLMs, because human language is not sufficient enough. (Atleast I thought) the goal was to make things simple and "just" ask your question to an LLM and get the answer, but normal language does not work for complex tasks.Especially in programming it is fun. People spent hours over hours to come up with a prompt that can (kinda-of) reliably produce code. So they try to hack/program some weird black box so that they can do their actual programming tasks. On some areas there might be a speed up, but I still don't know if it's worth it. It feels like we are creating more problems than solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42790820</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the frustrations and challenges associated with user interfaces (UI) in technology, particularly focusing on four-function calculators as a case study. It highlights how basic tools can become overly complicated due to poor design choices, leading to inefficiencies in everyday tasks. The author critiques the lack of intuitive design and emphasizes the importance of user-friendly interfaces that enhance usability rather than hinder it. Through this examination, the piece advocates for better UI practices in both simple and complex technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just putting it out here - before the recentish redesign of ios's default calculator, it had a widely non-intuitive behavior. Due to how it looked I assumed it works as a standard four-function calculator, but it was actually storing the whole expression in memory and executing it as per the standard precedence rules.I do usually prefer the latter behavior, but without it being displayed as in more advanced calculators (it has been changed to show it) it's just not what I would expect at all, resulting in wrong calculations. But maybe it was just a "me-problem".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I realised reading this that, even though I used to be quite adept with these common four-function calculators, I have since forgotten most of their operation. The past ten years or so I have exclusively been using RPN calculators – I find them so much easier to work with, and going by this article, possibly even easier to implement sensibly?(My main drivers are Emacs Calc on the computer and RealCalc on Android devices. For kitchen work I use a slide rule, which is something I think more people should do! There is nothing better for translating proportions.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone else was curious about the final image and the `x÷` button: http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/sharp_el-8.html----&gt; The keyboard on this calculator has the number of keys reduced to the minimum by the use of only three function keys, including a combined "x÷" key.&gt; Here, pressing "x÷" gives the multiplication function if "+=" is subsequently pressed to give the answer, and gives the division function if "-=" is subsequently pressed to give the answer, so:&gt; 4 x÷ 2 +=  gives the answer 8.&gt; 4 x÷ 2 -=  gives the answer 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42810300</guid></item><item><title>13.

This can usually be checked by looking for a sitemap.xml, there will be pages not redirected to your site that contain pages of links.- Closely following the above, the pages may not be links to other sites but might be hosting phishing pages for other services unrelated to yours. The redirect here acts as a bluff for casual inspection of the domain. You won't see page entries in a sitemap.xml file for these ones.- Attempting to "age" a domain. Not many talk about this option, but new domains are a red flag to a lot of automated security processes. When purchasing a domain and giving it a history associated with a legitimate service they make the domain look less suspicious for future malicious use.- Preparation for a targeted campaign. This is pretty unlikely, you need to be really worth a dedicated long term campaign effort specifically against you or your company. If you're doing controversial/novel research, are managing millions of dollars, performing a service a state actor would object to, or have high profile clientele then maybe you fall into this category. These are patient campaigns and want to make the domain "feel normal and official". They won't do anything public with the domain such as SEO tweaking or link spam, they'll use these domains only for specific targeted one-off low-noise attacks. They're relying on staff to see that the domain has been connected to your service for years and is likely just a domain someone in marketing purchased and forgot about. This is exceptionally rare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their play is to send emails with those domains but in the emails claiming to be you and when people reading the email go to the domain, they see your page (they got redirected).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just had a look - it appears you’ve got nine .com domains registered with your brand name in the same second on GoDaddy: explore/get/join/meet/my/team/the/tryEXAMPLE.com and EXAMPLEconnect.com.The Cloudflare redirect likely has GoDaddy underneath, based on what’s visible at myEXAMPLE.com/lander and others.Half of the domains are set for Outlook Mail, the other for Google Mail which points to a potential email game.It doesn’t make things safer that your brand name is a top-400 frequency word in one of the European languages. Not owning your .com and having a dozen businesses with similar names just compounds the risk.What to do really depends on the specifics of your case, including trademark and competition factors.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been using a catchall mailbox with hostname type names for over a decade now¹So, com.example.shop@example.org for https://shop.example.com account(s). I've recently switched to a randomized username part, as bitwarden supports this well.This has saved me numerous times from scams². Because scammers would email me on the wrong address. Either they'd mail me on an adress listed on my website, when the actual company would've mailed on the unique address I gave them (more targeted phishing). Or they'll mail me on an address that I know to be leaked (these are redirected to spam in filters).I am convinced there's an actual solution to a lot of scamming here, if the UX and UI are carefully designed. To be used by "muggles", not just the crowd that knows things like filters and catch-alls and plus-appended etc. It's a pity Google, Microsoft or even proton aren't actively promoting such a "unique mail for every service". But I guess there's little in it for them.¹ used to self host, but now that's near impossible with the monopolies on mailserves at big tech and moved to mailbox.org. big shoutout!² aside from the other great benefit. I'm often one of the first to know some service or site was compromised by receiving scam, spam etc. A few times I was even the one to report a breach to such an org via this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest scare I've gotten is somehow ending up on "colnbase.com" (instead of "coinbase.com").It's defunct now, but at the time it was a 1:1 replica of Coinbase. And the only reason I noticed was because 1Password didn't offer to fill in my credentials.While knowing someone's email/password combo might not be enough for an attacker to do anything malicious on Coinbase itself (due to email re-verification maybe), the point is that even the smartest of us Hacker News users can fall for it. And that should scare the rest of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can tell it's a scam call immediately because Google has no such thing as "support", let alone an actual "support engineer"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42810252</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m no expert in formal methods, but of all the tools I’ve used, Athena [0] has been one of my favorites to work with. The proofs read much more like what you’re used to seeing in math literature.0. https://athena-lang.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Lean 4 as a general purpose programming language, but I can't use it because no current AI coding assistant can reliably work with me in Lean. I can be trying six languages at once like a chess master playing an exhibition simultaneous match, and they'll all flow in Cursor using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or even Windsurf. Then add Lean 4 and everyone chokes.On the other hand, Claude 3.5 Sonnet understands my iPad math drawings better than my colleagues. I am admittedly weird, but AI as an association engine of incomprehensible scope likes trippy. Trippy helps its reach. Philosophy never really worked until now when you can run it on a computer. AI really rewards recursive meta; it picks up speed like ice sailing. We're would-be shamans sitting around the fire a million years ago, imagining we can control the dance of the flames. With AI, we can.Claude also understands, say, computational group theory or strategies for combinatorial enumeration, remarkably well. So it can assist in math research.Formal proofs in Lean 4 may be hard to read, but the elephant in the room is how hard conventional math papers are to read. We're terrible at expressing ourselves, so reading a paper is the equivalent of reverse-engineering bad computer code to reconstruct thoughts the author failed to express. And it's embarrassing in 2025 that conventional papers can't be automatically checked.A new genre will emerge in between: In the "Centaur" model Gary Kasparov popularized after he recovered from his chess defeat by IBM's Big Blue, we want papers to actually be very careful, battle-tested prompts for AI. They will pass as conventional papers for mathematicians still trapped in amber, but they're really just prompts for both us and AI.The documentation for Lean 4 is aimed at humans. If it were designed to be a hybrid "Centaur" prompt doc, perhaps my tools would be better able to help me code in Lean 4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42815755</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founder of Home Assistant here. Let me know if anyone has any questions about the project or the Open Home Foundation (which now owns Home Assistant, ESPHome etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh man. I love Home Assistant. But I think of it as a really fun hobby. Maintaining, getting dashboards working, integrating with wireless local network standards… It ends up very technical, very quickly, as Mr. Petersson so ably demonstrates. That said, using it has put me hard on the side of preferring home devices with open management platforms. I keep feeling there’s a chance my smart home could stay off the cloud and have good automation if only I buy the right nerd tech..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've built a KNX house about 10 years ago and I'm still quite happy. Let me share some experience:Having the light switch on the smartphone does not make it any smarter, just more complex.The following automations are the most valuable for me:- automatic blinds. Go down when too much sun hits the facade, go down when dark outside, go up with too much wind.
No concern leaving for work, and coming back to an overheated living room (no AC needed). But still automatically collect the direct sun in winter/spring.- motion sensors, turn on lights when dark and motion in the room, every room- night mode - low level motion-activated light in all bedrooms, corridor and bathroom.  No automatic lights in bedroom, orientation lights on, night light sockets on, blinds downThis brought me to rarely touching a button/switch, twice a day, maybe?And then there is toys- blinds can fully close when room is empty, but go to half tilted with presence, angles following the sun, for maximum natural light without direct sun- TV lowers the blinds behind that would give a reflection- opening the terrace door opens the blinds and turns off indoor lights, to not attract mosquitos (idk if that even helps)- shower motion sensor turns ventilation on high- some sockets go on/off for Christmas lights- logging of appliances, water, ventilation, heating.I like that the low level stuff in KNX does not need/have a central hub. But the higher level requires extra smarts. I plan to migrate those to Home Assistant this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42813513</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for effectively scaling WebSocket connections in modern applications. It outlines the challenges associated with maintaining persistent, real-time connections as user demand grows, highlighting techniques such as load balancing, horizontal scaling, and using message brokers to distribute traffic. The piece emphasizes the importance of infrastructure design to handle large numbers of concurrent connections while ensuring low latency and reliability. It also suggests monitoring and optimization practices to enhance performance in WebSocket implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all true, but it also serves to remind us that Rails gives developers so much out of the box, even if you're not aware of it.ActionCable is Rails' WebSockets wrapper library, and it addresses basically every pain point in the post. However, it does so in a way that all Rails developers are using the same battle-tested solution. There's no need for every project to hack together its own proprietary approach.Thundering herds, heartbeat monitoring are both covered.If you need a messaging schema, I strongly recommend that you check out CableReady. It's a powerful library for triggering outcomes on the client. It ships with a large set of operations, but adding custom operations is trivial.https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/hello-world/While both ActionCable and CableReady are Rails libraries, other frameworks would score huge wins if they adopted their client libraries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key to managing this complexity is to avoid mixing transport-level state with application-level state. The same approach for scaling HTTP requests also works for scaling WebSocket connections:* Read, write and track all application-level state in a persistent data store.* Identify sessions with a session token so that application-level sessions can span multiple WebSocket connections.It's a lot easier to do this if your application-level protocol consists of a single discrete request and response (a la RPC). But you can also handle unidirectional/bidirectional streaming, as long as the stream states are tracked in your data store and on the client side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only complexity I have found with regards to scaling WebSockets is knowing the minimum delay between flush event completion and actual message completion to destination. It takes longer to process a message, even on IPC routing, than it does to kill a socket. That has upstream consequences with consideration of redirection and message pipes between multiple sockets. If you kill a socket too early after a message is flushed from the socket there is a good chance the destination sees the socket collapse before it has processed the final message off the socket and that processing delay is not something a remote location is easily aware of.I have found for safety you need to allow an arbitrary delay of 100ms before killing sockets to ensure message completion which is likely why the protocol imposes a round trip of control frame opcode 8 before closing the connection the right way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42816359</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen worse deals offered in prospectuses. But not often.Having two tiers of stock with the insiders having the control shares used to be prohibited by the New York Stock Exchange. Now it's common. Google and Facebook are set up that way, so they have presidents for life. So are some lesser companies which really need to fire the CEO but can't.Then, what you're buying into is not the operating entity. It's just a holding company. Not even the parent holding company that owns many casinos; that's BALY. It's a holding company in the middle, one whose returns are totally determined by the other parts of the stack. This is much like film investing, where you can buy an interest in "Silver Screen Partners IV" and get a share of the profits from a specific film. Except that the studio and the film producer control the accounting between related entities. Those deals are generally a lose, although you get to go to the premier and meet the cast.And then there's the leverage. When you buy in, you're under water, and may stay there. Can't speak to the tax consequences.This is so awful it makes meme coins look good.(Favorite worst deals: 1) being pitched on municipal bonds backed only by revenue from future sewer charges for a development not yet built, and which never was. Junk municipal bonds are a thing. 2) a San Francisco strip club that did an IPO in the first dot-com boom and went bust. SEC CIK 931799.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an aside at the end of the article, but what an interesting strategy:I bought the stock for the same reason I buy stock in every hotel, airline, bank, and similar I use: in the unlikely event a not-particularly-high-stakes poker player has a routine customer service complaint, Investor Relations is available as an escalation strategy, over e.g. hotel staff who might be long-since inured to listening to complaints from people who lost money in a casino.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holy fuck that's a terrible deal they offered on the $250 shares! Made up billion-dollar valuation aside, an 11% interest rate on a $24,750 loan means that it's never going to pay for itself and start producing a return for the owner, even at casino-level profits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42816418</guid></item><item><title>20.

Maybe other BDFL projects would be inspired by VIM's experience and setup successors early.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; How can we make Vim9 script, the new Vim scripting language, more widely used?One way is to inform users and prospective plugin writers that1) Vim9 script is vastly superior to the old Vimscript, to the point where it is not unpleasant to use, and2) it is much more conductive to writing text editor code than the general purpose Lua.Of course this still does not mean that people will want to learn yet another scripting language to write Vim plugins in particular when they already know Lua, but it is very important to be adequately informed about the two above points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many of the Vim nerds I know, including myself, have switched over to Neovim.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; my workflow consists of switching back and forth between a terminal window and an editor window.Same! I run neovim in tmux together with stuff I hack on. I switch beteen tmux windows with shift-arrows and it works so well. I run this full screen in Ghostty. No distractions.I try Zed and VSCode and I always come back to this setup. It works so well for me personally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've recently switched from SublimeText to Zed and I like it so far, mainly because it's noticeably faster at all UI touch points (typing, searching, pane switching). I mainly use it to work on a Rails codebase. I set up a bunch of snippets to have the same keyboard shortcuts offered by Sublime to insert ERB instructions. I managed to get rubocop to perform in-editor validations, same for eslint however "format on save" with eslint continues to fail (it either writes an empty file or it ignores my eslint config and falls back to its internal settings). I haven't used its code completion features since my use of AI to assist with coding happens outside of an IDE (yes, I will try to change that).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; all the configuration that goes into it before I can use it to start writing code.Yes, this is awful and something the default should've changed years ago instead of continuing this massive collective time waste.
But presumably after 15 years you've configured almost everything you need? At least to the point of matching a static config file?&gt; Lua is great, but one JSON file is even better.No way, it's a strict downgrade, you can have a simple lua table exactly matching json things, but then should you decide to do anything dynamic/complicated (which at one point even included formatting as Zed broke your config format on changes), you're stuck with json with no way out&gt; Installing plugins means updating them, which inevitably breaks things.No it doesn't, just pin the version you the one that works for you and ignore the future? Or do you need that extra functionality from the updates? But then does Zed without a plugin even have this functionality?But also Zed does plan to have plugins, so this won't be different?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42817277</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an introduction to compilers, explaining their role in translating high-level programming languages into machine code that computers can execute. It outlines the fundamental components of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these components for anyone interested in creating their own programming language. The article also includes practical insights and a roadmap for developing a basic compiler from scratch, highlighting both challenges and rewarding aspects of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one way to write a compiler. One of the large tradeoffs made is extensive use of libraries on both the front and backends. It's a practical choice but also means that the compiler itself is also likely somewhat slow. Targeting LLVM alone is a choice that will guarantee that code gen is slow (you pay for a lot of unneeded complexity in llvm with every compile).When you master the principles of parsing, it is straightforward to do in any language by hand with good performance. It is easy to write a function in any language that takes a range string, such as "_a-zA-Z" and returns a table of size 256 with 65-90, 95 and 97-122 set to 1 and the rest set to zero. You can build your parser easily on top of these tables (this is not necessarily optimal but it is more than good enough when you are starting).For the backend, you can target another language that you already know. It could be javascript, c or something else. This will be much easier than targeting llvm.Start with hello world and build up the functionality you need. In no more than 10k lines of code (and typically significantly less), you can achieve self hosting. Then you can rewrite the compiler in itself. By this point you have identified the parts of the language you like and the parts that you don't or are not carrying weight. This is the point at which maybe it makes sense to target llvm or write a custom assembly backend.The beauty of this approach is you keep the language small from the beginning without relying on a huge pile of dependencies. For a small compiler, you do not need concurrency or other fancy features because the programs it compiles are almost definitionally small.Now you have a language that is optimized for writing compilers that you understand intimately. You can use it to design a new language that has the fancy things you want like data race protection. Repeat the same process as before except this time you start with concurrent hello world and build in the data race protection from the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to design your own language, you might want to start with IParse Studio, an interactive online parser that parses input according a grammer at every keystroke returning a parse tree, if the input can be parsed according the grammar.Once you have the grammar, you can use it with IParse developed in C++, which produces an abstract parse tree.IParse has a build-in scanner for C like terminals, which are now used in many languages. You can implement your own scanner. IParse also has an unparser, which allows you to generate pretty printed output with just some annotations in the grammar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm so excited to see that the idea of creating new programming languages is getting more popular. There is definitely a lot of space in which to explore more creativity; we haven't even remotely begun to scratch the surface of what's possible!I just wish more tooling existed that was language-agnostic so that it's easier to get off the ground with something “serious”. I'm talking debuggers, parse-tree-aware diffs, autocompletion like Intellisense, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791036</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here. The browser is made from scratch (not based on Chromium/Webkit), in Zig, using v8 as a JS engine.Our idea is to build a lightweight browser optimized for AI use cases like LLM training and agent workflows. And more generally any type of web automation.It's a work in progress, there are hundreds of Web APIs, and for now we just support some of them (DOM, XHR, Fetch). So expect most websites to fail or crash. The plan is to increase coverage over time.Happy to answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool project, congrats guys!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a really cool project. Scrapping aside, I would definitely use this with playwright for end2end tests if it had 100% compatibility with chrome and ran with a fraction of the time/memory.At my company we have a small project where we are running the equivalent of 6.5 hours of end2end tests daily using playwright. Running the tests in parallel takes around half an hour. Your project is still in very early stages, but assuming 10x speed, that would mean we could pass all our tests in roughtly 3 min (best case scenario).That being said, I would make use of your browser, but would likely not make use of your business offering (our tests require internal VPN, have some custom solution for reporting, would be a lot of work to change for little savings; we run all tests currently in spot/preemptible instances which are already 80% cheaper).Business-wise I found very little info on your website. "4x the efficiency at half the cost" is a good catch phrase, but compared to what? I mean, you can have servers in Hetzner or in AWS and one is already a fraction of the cost of the other. How convenient is to launch things on your remote platform vs launch them locally or setting it up? does it provide any advantages in the case of web scrapping compared to other solutions? how parallelizable is it? Do you have any paying customers already?Supercool tech project. Best of luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42817439</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept that every distributed system can be viewed as a log, emphasizing the importance of managing state and coordination effectively to enhance performance and reliability. It outlines the challenges associated with coordination in distributed applications, such as latency and complexity, and proposes strategies to mitigate these issues by leveraging log-based architectures. The author advocates for using logs to simplify interactions between components and reduce direct dependencies, thereby promoting a decentralized approach that improves scalability and fault tolerance in distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a basic concept in accounting. The general ledger is an immutable log of transactions. Other accounting documents are constructed from the general ledger, and can, if necessary, be rebuilt from it. This is the accepted way to do money-related things.Synchronization is called "reconcilation" in accounting terminology.The computer concept is that we have a current state, and changes to it come in. The database with the current state is authoritative. This is not suitable for handling money.The real question is, do you really care what happened last month? Last year? If yes, a log-based approach is appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post makes a great case for how universal logs are in data systems. It was strange to me that there was no log-as-service with the qualities that make it suitable for building higher-level systems like durable execution: conditional appends (as called out by the post!), support very large numbers of logs, allow pushing high throughputs with strict ordering, and just generally provide a simple serverless experience like object storage. This led to https://s2.dev/ which is now available in preview.It was interesting to learn how Restate links events for a key, with key-level logical logs multiplexed over partitioned physical logs. I imagine this is implemented with a leader per physical log, so you can consistently maintain an index. A log service supporting conditional appends allows such a leader to act like the log is local to it, despite offering replicated durability.Leadership can be an important optimization for most systems, but shared logs also allow for multi-writer systems pretty easily. We blogged about this pattern https://s2.dev/blog/kv-store&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some clarification on what "one log" means here:- It means using one log across different concerns like state a, communication with b, lock c. Often that is in the scope of a single entity (payment, user, session, etc.) and thus the scope for the one log is still small. You would have a lot of independent logs still, for separate payments.- It does _not_ mean that one should share the same log (and partition) for all the entities in your app, like necessarily funneling all users, payments, etc. through the same log. That goes actually beyond the proposal here - has some benefits of its own, but have a hard time scaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42813049</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author of "All you need to know about KVM userspace" here! I am happy that you liked it. Some things have changed since then, some have not...Red Hat is now shipping Kata Containers, which does not (much to my dismay) use Libvirt, and also KubeVirt which uses Libvirt but not for sandboxing (only to drive QEMU; Kubernetes takes care of the sandboxing by running one VM per pod). But the original architecture is still in use and new users appeared such as cockpit-machine and crun-vm.Another super interesting project for KVM userspace is libkrun which, among other things, is being used for gaming on Arm Mac's. :)Firecracker's scope has grown somewhat, in particular it supports snapshots for warm start of VMs.QEMU's microvm didn't have a huge success but recently Amazon contributed support for running Nitro enclaves in QEMU, which reuses a lot of the microvm code.Some Rust components have been developed to build virtio devices out of process (for example virtiofsd). QEMU is also experimenting with devices written in Rust, and I expect to have two almost-entirely-safe-Rust devices (converted from C) within a month or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use Ubicloud for our GHA runners, because we have a very extensive test suite and need the extra parallelisation. Extremely easy to roll out from GHA, reduced our CI costs from CircleCI by 80% and we've been very pleased.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, generating sentence embeddings through pooling token embeddings can potentially sacrifice fine-grained details present at the token level. ColBERT overcomes this by representing text as token-level multi-vectors rather than a single, aggregated vector. This approach, leveraging contextual late interaction at the token level, allows ColBERT to retain more nuanced information and improve search accuracy compared to methods relying solely on sentence embeddings.I don't know what it is about ColBERT that affords such opaque descriptions, but this is sadly common. I find the above explanation incredibly difficult to parse.I have my own explanation of ColBERT here but I'm not particularly happy with that either: https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/colbert-ragatouilleIf anyone wants to try explaining ColBERT without using jargon like "token-level multi-vectors" or "contextual late interaction" I'd love to see a clear description of it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See psycopg Identifier for binding table nameshttps://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/api/sql.html#psycopg.s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL there is pgvector and pgvecto.rs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42809990</guid></item><item><title>27.

Going from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM wiki on the history of Wikipedia, there were "Computing machines" in the 30s referring to their calculators and tabulating machines. IBM was already selling more than 5 of these devices, so if the 1943 date was true, it makes no sense. So it referring to a single machine having a market of 5 devices, that might be true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may be apocryphal, but it's not all that wrong.Those "about five" computers even have names: AWS, Azure, GCP, ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791906</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My observation with the Scala and Haskell ecosystems has been very similar. One primary source of churn is changing interfaces. And very advanced static type systems offer a large design space how to model interfaces. Which leads to lots of incremental improvements. But lots of interface changes together with deep dependency trees lead to exponential explosion of changes.Rich Hickey has been discussing this very early, but almost nobody got it when he said it, myself included. Striving for obviously simple interfaces, that avoid nominal static types like the plague, is the way to avoid this often pointless waves of changes through language ecosystem, just because someone designed a better option monad or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like Rust-the-language, but I hate the Rust-dependencies situation. Honestly I like C++ a lot better for that. People will complain that "it's hard to add a dependency to a C++ project", but I actually see it as a feature. It forces you to think about whether or not it is worth it.In C++, I control my dependencies. In Rust I get above 100 so quickly I just give up. In terms of security, let's be honest: I have no clue what I am shipping.Also Rust does not have ABI compatibility and no culture of shared libraries (I guess it wouldn't be practical anyway given the number of libraries one needs). But that just destroys the OS package distribution model: when I choose a Linux distribution, I choose to trust those who build it. Say Canonical has a security team that tries to minimize the security issues in the packages that Ubuntu provides. Rust feels a lot more like Python in that sense, where anyone could push anything to PyPi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently revived a web app I wrote in 2006, my first startup. It was a social media site focused on media sharing. A pretty simple LAMP stack for the time. PHP 5, MySQL 3.2, but it has all of your typical (for the time) social media features. I revived this app because I wanted some hands-on time with new CI/CD tech that I don't get to use at my day job, so I'm working to extremely over-engineer the app's deployment process as a learning project. I could have used Wordpress or some other Hello World app, but this is a lot more fun.I had written nearly all of the PHP from scratch. I wrote libraries for authentication/authorization, templating, form processing etc. I used one PEAR library for sending email. The frontend was vanilla HTML and there was barely any JavaScript to speak of. We used Flash for media playback. In other words, myself and my small team built nearly all of it ourselves. This was just how you did most things in 2006.It only took me about an hour to get the 19-year old app up and running. I had to update the old PHP mysql drivers to mysqli, and update the database schema and some queries to work in MySQL 8 (mostly wrapping now-reserved words with backticks and adjusting column defaults which are now more strict). The only thing that didn't work was the Flash.An hour to revive an app from 2006. Contrast this with my day job, wherein we run scores of Spring Boot apps written in Java 8 that have pages of vulnerabilities from tens of dozens of dependencies, which are not easy to update because updating one library necessitates updating many other libraries, and oh my goodness, the transitive dependencies. It's a nightmare, and because of this we only do the bare minimum of work to update the most critical vulnerabilities. There's no real plan to update everything because it's just too tall of an order.And the funny thing is, if you compare what this PHP app from 2006 did, which had truly, barely any dependencies, to what these Spring Boot apps do, there is not a lot of difference. At the end of the day, it's all CRUD, with a lot more enterprise dressing and tooling around it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42812641</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The document presents a research paper that focuses on the significance of industry participation in software testing and the challenges faced in the realm of software testing standards and practices. It analyzes the current landscape of software testing within the industry, highlighting the need for more effective methodologies and collaboration between academia and industry. The paper emphasizes the importance of adopting innovative testing techniques and frameworks to enhance software quality and reliability, and it provides a critical assessment of existing practices while proposing avenues for future research and development in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abstract:"We present the design of CompFuzzCI, a framework for incorporating compiler fuzzing into the continuous integration (CI) workflow of the compiler for Dafny, an open-source programming language that is increasingly used in and contributed to by industry. CompFuzzCI explores the idea of running a brief fuzzing campaign as part of the CI workflow of each pull request to a compiler project. Making this effective involved devising solutions for various challenges, including how to deduplicate bugs, how to bisect the project’s revision history to find the commit responsible for a regression (challenging when project interfaces change over time), and how to ensure that fuzz testing complements existing regression testing efforts. We explain how we have engaged with the Dafny development team at Amazon to approach these and other problems in the design of CompFuzzCI, and the lessons learned in the process. As a by-product of our work with CompFuzzCI, we found and reported three previously-unknown bugs in the Dafny compiler. We also present a controlled experiment simulating the use of CompFuzzCI over time on a range of Dafny commits, to assess its ability to find historic bugs. CompFuzzCI prioritises support for the Dafny compiler and the fuzz-d fuzzer but has a generalisable design: with modest modification to its internal interfaces, it could be adapted to work with other fuzzers, and the lessons learned from our experience will be relevant to teams considering including fuzzing in the CI of other industrial software projects."https://github.com/CompFuzzCI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A pleasant surprise seeing an Alastair Donaldson supported paper. What I liked most at Imperial was the amount of professors pushing for things that sat between the fully theoretical world, and the more real engineering world. From a first quick skim this paper seems to hit that right on the head. I've been wanting to see how I could introduce more of the fun of formal verification into my job, so I'll be digging deep into this one for some inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42775422</guid></item><item><title>35.

Really smart idea to get us one step closer to workable human workflows.Watching you work with it, I found I wanted something that mushes aider and your stuff together. Where I am spending time in aider, I am spending time complaining about claude using bad patterns, assuming bad structure/types/etc or misunderstanding the purpose of a set of code. Where it looks like you are spending time is in fixing coding errors, and manually reviewing patches.At the very least, it seems like automating / making easy compilation and type checking results would be nice.Having used aider for over a year now, I know he's spent a lottt of time on prompting customization for both improved code quality and also DIFF format, and I wonder if you would benefit from some of those lessons in terms of getting better code out of different models.Anyway, this is awesome, and I love the idea of giving some tools to the LLM to engage with the codebase, pull context and then code. Super cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42776029</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of telepresent wind, which combines wind energy generation with digital communication and immersive experiences. It explores how technology can create the sensation of wind in virtual environments, enhancing remote interactions by simulating physical sensations. The project aims to bridge the gap between digital and physical experiences, allowing users to feel the presence of wind even when they are physically distant. This innovative approach seeks to improve online interactions, making them more engaging and lifelike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good experiment - felt a little underwhelming in current avatar.The motion appears jerky and unnatural -- as they are being forced to move by the mechanism at the bottom versus a natural setting that has the lower stems fixed in place and orientation while the tops sway.Also when you have a large number of these stalks in nature we often see them sway in "waves" as smal gusts of wind blows over them in one direction causing sometimes visible ripples along the top 'surface'.Also, who is to say if the sensor is capturing the wind/movement at source faithfully and rest of the mechanism is reproducing it well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that even this gives me an uncanny valley feeling, something about the fact that the motion of the stalk is "bottom-up" rather than "top-down" and that all of the stalks are trying to move in unison rather than wind kind of gently cascading over the institution.I imagine the piece was supposed to be haunting in a completely different way -- so the idea would be that you'd be embedded in a space which is experiencing a "real" wind that you can't yourself feel on your skin, and so you'd feel like you took a step outside of reality. In that sense this would be an exhibit that a video probably can't do justice to? But I think the uncanny valley thing still sells it pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really enjoy David’s art, and I’m always happy to see it posted here - I think he does a great job of meshing the mechanical and the natural with enough of a dose of the absurd that I always find myself smiling at his work. I really love his plant bots - there’s some interesting research on plant “intelligence” and signaling that he’s gesturing at that lead me to really want to try to expand some of those projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42811269</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN, thanks for posting. My name is Grischa, I'm the creator of Threlte. Here's a blog post of what's new in Threlte 8: https://threlte.xyz/blog/threlte-8Threlte is a renderer and component library for using Three.js in a declarative and state-driven way in Svelte apps. It provides strictly typed components for deep reactivity and interactivity out-of-the-box.It's suffice to say it was a whole lot of work and a great challenge to make use of Svelte 5. A lot of the important parts have been rewritten to make use of the new reactivity model, some APIs have been aligned with conventions introduced by Svelte 5 and type safety has been improved all over. Also this release includes the first alpha release of Threlte Studio which is what we call a spatial programming toolset.If you're looking for an migration guide, it's here: https://threlte.xyz/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#thr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The migration guide is massive.Threlte 8 is yet another example of how little backward compatibility matters to JS library developers and adopting such a library can be a costly endeavor.Backward compatibility is readily and easily sacrificed in the name of ... what exactly?Other examples:MUI (Material UI lib) - some kudos are warranted for the existence of a migration tool but there are too many migrations that are not trivial or easy to change.Angular - the OG of "All your code is now worthless, adopt or die" (some may be too young to remember Angular v1)Vue - completely unnecessary renames and plenty of breaking changes between v2 and v3The list goes on and on.And it is not like you can afford to stay behind several major versions either. Eventually a CVE pops up that will not be fixed in older versions or the dependency tree will mess you up because you are relying on older versions that are incompatible with newer ones in some arcane 5 liner npm package.Tread careful when choosing a JS library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lovely to see a new major release, I bet that was a lot of work! Congratulations!That saidI hate websites that highjack scrolls to show an animation, especially on a frontpage. I immediately dismiss a product I am planning to buy just because it has scroll animations, and go straight to a competitor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42813264</guid></item><item><title>41.

Here’s an example, in a poem called “Nicholson Baker &amp; I,” from Catherine Barnett’s book “Solutions for the Problem of Bodies in Space”: “‘Open the second shutter/so that more light may come in,’/said Goethe on his deathbed.”This technique is less contemporary than the author thinks. Marianne Moore was writing with incorporated quotations a century ago, combining epigraph, endnotes, uncited allusion, and direct quotations in the text itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.ph/a6wUa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fortunately, computer science and every single other discipline, topic, and community doesn't chronically suffer from the exact same issue.If you know anybody or anything that knows/has solved this gatekeeping problem with any level of consistency, please share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42758714</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of data branching in batch job systems, which allows for the efficient management of data processes by creating separate branches for different paths of data execution. It explains how this approach can enhance performance, reduce conflicts, and streamline workflows in data processing environments. The author provides insights into implementing data branching, including practical examples and considerations necessary for optimizing batch jobs, thus aiming to guide developers in improving system efficiency and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting pattern that I've thought about in "intelligent systems" is "patching" which could be applied at various stages of a process.If you look at the average training set used in competitive evaluations you will find examples in it that are just plain wrong which put an upper limit on both the evaluation scores and the real-world performance based on that data.Very occasionally someone does the hard work to improve the training and eval set and,  if the world was efficient,  this would be the new data set everyone uses.In real life you are getting more data all the time and you need a stable way to keep your data set "patched" as new data comes in.  Similarly,  an AI step later in the process needs to (i) have a human override so it can get things right for the consumer and (ii) remember that override so not to waste the time of the human or wear them out emotionally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apache Iceberg supports Branching and Tagging since some early versions https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.4.0/branching/#overviewAnd the broader name for what the author is describing is the Write-Audit-Publish pattern, where data gets written into a branch first, audited/checked, and then the main branch gets replaced with the new one, effectively publishing the updated dataset using a single command. https://www.tabular.io/apache-iceberg-cookbook/data-engineer...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This pattern is really meaningful conceptually but the tricky thing is to not create a mess in the process.If it's too easy to branch people will do so and the (knowledge) economics scale disappears (and we'll have a mess).If the common data definition is too hard to branch from no experiments will happen (slow).I think most tech for this seem to make it too easy, and in the process injecting a bunch of dependencies that makes it slow and harder to access. May have changed since I last looked.I found that the simple pattern of versioned paths/table names as `s3://mybucket/mystage/version=42/` or `my_table_v42` puts a high enough evolutionary cost on branching (as consumers need to explicitly adapt) while it also doesn't have the costs associated with using special tech (legacy/lock in/dependencies).It's also searchable on github/slack/etc if done right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791310</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I'm increasingly noticing about LLM-generated content is that...nobody wants it.(I mean "nobody" in the sense of "nobody likes Nickelback". ie, not literally nobody.)If I want to talk to an AI, I can talk to an AI. If I'm reading a blog or a discussion forum, it's because I want to see writing by humans. I don't want to read a wall of copy+pasted LLM slop posted under a human's name.I now spend dismaying amounts of time and energy avoiding LLM content on the web. When I read an article, I study the writing style, and if I detect ChatGPTese ("As we dive into the ever-evolving realm of...") I hit the back button. When I search for images, I use a wall of negative filters (-AI, -Midjourney, -StableDiffusion etc) to remove slop (which would otherwise be &gt;50% of my results for some searches). Sometimes I filter searches to before 2022.If Google added a global "remove generative content" filter that worked, I would click it and then never unclick it.I don't think I'm alone. There has been research suggesting that users immediately dislike content they perceive as AI-created, regardless of its quality. This creates an incentive for publishers to "humanwash" AI-written content—to construct a fiction where a human is writing the LLM slop you're reading.Falsifying timestamps and hijacking old accounts to do this is definitely something I haven't seen before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It had fairly steady growth until 2012, before petering out throughout the 2010s and 2020s in lieu of more centralized sites like StackExchange, and by 2025, only a small community was leftThis timeline tracks with my own blogging. Google slowly stopped ranking traditional forum posts and blogs as well around that time, regardless of quality, unless it was a “major”.&gt; But, unlike so many other fora from back in the early days, it went from 2003 to 2025 without ever changing its URLs, erasing its old posts, or going down altogether.I can also confirm if you have a bookmark to my blog from 2008, that link will still work!The CMS is no longer, it's all static now... which too few orgs take the short amount of time to bother with when "refreshing" their web presence :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is sad that this is happening to PhysicsForums. It was one of first websites I was using frequently 15 years ago when I started my physics passion (later career). I was active reader and contributed on few occasions but I still remember some members who I thought that one day I will be smart and knowledgeable like them. With years and the move to social media following Arab spring things started to change (as part of the overall transition from forum being the dominant place for discussions). But I stopped visiting it around 2018 unless I came through google search (later kagi). I still find the archive useful to answer some questions and I would disagree with author of article that because no one is sharing links on twitter that means no one care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42816284</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; According to Pew Research https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/ 15 percent of U.S. adults only access the internet through a mobile device.That number seemed surprising to me - I actually expected the portion of mobile-only internet users would be significantly higher than that.Turns out the 15% number means something slightly different. From that Pew Research page:"Today, 15% of U.S. adults are “smartphone-only” internet users – meaning they own a smartphone but say they do not subscribe to a home broadband service."So the 15% is people who use the internet exclusively via LTE/5G without paying for home broadband.(I'm surprised that number isn't higher as well.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am curious to understand what bearing "lots and lots of regular people solely use their cellphone to conduct consumer transactions" has on GitHub, whose audience is significantly different than median and cannot otherwise function without a laptop/desktop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using availability as a metric for UI bugs is great. After all, UI is just an API for humans, and it breaking breaks workflows.&gt; These unique kinds of UIs have less convention and unique accessibility characteristics that are expensive to solve. But a lot of the time, our budget should be zero. To build it with what we have already. To copy-paste.If you build UIs like this, you end up with the sort of one-size-fits-all UIs no one likes. Like when Twitter (and others) consolidated their desktop and mobile UIs into one mobile-first one that works worse on. You waste a bunch of space and information density, lose eye scanning ability, for the benefit of higher developer velocity. It must be carefully applied. Things like shipping address forms (example from article) or yes/no modals are a great place for standardization but trying to assemble those pieces on a single page, or show something slightly different and you're back to square one.---Didn't we try to standardize some of this already? Isnt this why &lt;input&gt;s are derived from the OS and why alert() and prompt() exist? And default style sheets? And no one wanted this! Browsers have opened up _everything_ to be customized, capitulating to designers. And even with all that customization, some things like HTML5 validation still feel like theyre missing pieces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42817163</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've had this exact same issue a lot as well! I tend to walk way faster than google assumes I should.Maybe one suggestion I could think of, would be a risk score. Given a set of segments, which transfers are the most "risky"? (From those departures, arrivals and transfer estimates, how bad would the impact be going forward from missing a transfer?)The main thing I get from Google Map's estimates is an indication that something has changed. If google gives me a route I wouldn't expect, it's normally because some trains/busses have been removed from the schedule today/running slow. Without forcing a route on you, it would be nice to have it hint at the fact that I'll be catching the last train that hour, thus making segments before it "riskier", scaled by how often they arrive + how long my transfer time is + how out of sync they are from the next segment's departures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can definitely see use cases where DIY routing would be better than traditional routing. But the thing that bothers me most about almost all mobile navigation apps is thw complete inability to multi task. Want to compare two routes? You can't without losing your state re-searching for the route each time. Same problem if you want to say compare reviews for a few different businesses in an area, or worse, different areas.You can sometimes work around this by accessing the web versions or using 2 different navigation apps, but it's dumb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the DIY routing concept!  It certainly would have helped me during my most recent trip to Japan.Google was great this time around but it just didn't understand that people might want to stop and look at stuff while walking between trains, and I found myself having to fiddle with it and sometimes restart whole trips when being able to pause and restart them would have worked (or maybe I just don't know how to do that?).DIY routing sounds closer to having an intelligent version of those books of timetables I used to carry around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42811435</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of modular PC design as a sustainable approach to computing. It emphasizes the benefits of modular systems, including ease of upgrading components, reducing electronic waste, and promoting longer device lifespans. By allowing users to replace individual parts rather than entire machines, modular PCs can lead to more environmentally-friendly practices in technology consumption. The piece advocates for a shift in the PC market towards modular designs to enhance sustainability while meeting the evolving needs of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PCs are already extremely modular, and they have been modular for multiple decades now.All Intel needs to do is not refresh the socket with every CPU generation, slap a green sticker on the box, and amp up their marketing to include "green" and "less e-waste" and all that.They'll be able to virtue signal to the environmentally conscious with minimal capital outlay and whatever this engineering masturbation article is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How about supporting a socket for more than one generation?My desktop PC from 2018 is still going strong, on account of using the AM4 socket (AMD). That allowed me to upgrade to the 5800X3D a while back, a whole two generations or four years newer than the original CPU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market forces are driving companies to make more and more highly integrated, glued together macbook clones because consumers demand them. Or at least manufacturers think they do.Maybe it's time for a class of repairable laptops/desktops, similar to what Intel did with their "Ultrabook" branding a decade ago. Call it an ecobook, and require upgradable storage, RAM, and access to replacement parts for 10 years. Something that lets companies say "this is thicker than a macbook, but not because it's worse".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42810865</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Wayland may well replace X in the future, but at the time of writing X is still the de-facto standard for a window systemIs it? The article was written end of last year. I believe the most widespread DEs on the most widespread distros now use Wayland by default, don't they?There's now stuff that just works better on Wayland today. I've kept X11 for a very long time, probably until 2023, because of little annoying details, but now it just works. I think the only remaming thing that annoys me is some apps like Kate not coming to the to the foreground when invoked.Things are slowly going to stop working on X11. Perhaps not today, but we are talking about setting up a new Linux install.Especially something like Arch that has all the recent versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still use X11 because it just works. I understand that Wayland is the "latest and greatest", but I genuinely do not understand why I need to upgrade yet. Could someone provide an actual tangible example as to why Wayland is "better" than X11? I've only ever heard hand-wavy explanations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not a criticism of the article / documents but an observation that aligns with others comments. For new users it is probably not going to be an issue to select a different window manager / desktop experience.Boot Arch ISORun archinstallselect desktop / window manager you wish to installNo requirement to manually setup X or Wayland, as the scripts / install will take care of it for you. I also understand that this is not 100% in the ethos of using Arch (where you should really understand all the packages going into your system and how all the configuration is done).I would also include that the following is also a good resource for learning Arch. https://arcolinux.com/ (although is is a derivative of Arch this site has alot of documentation that users can learn from)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42781578</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a corporate job, starting projects will catapult you more than finishing them. Especially long multi year projects.My mentor mentioned this to me and it took me a LONG time to understand it.Starting an AI project for example will:1. position you as the AI thought leader just becuase you were first to the idea2. associate AI used anywhere with you3. bring you up in any conversation about AIIt's really weird but this how all those useless executives operate. Start projects and leave :) . 
Highly recommend reading "Stealing the Corner Offfice" https://a.co/d/5dTRSNQ if you don't plan to do a startup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My best leaders have been those who "share their Legos", so to say. That don't hoard information, but instead step aside and let others take on more responsibility.My first tech lead when I started working had a great reputation. Everyone in the company knew him. I looked up to him. He knew everything! Whatever feature I worked on and needed to ask details about our integration partner, he could answer. Only later did I realize it was more because he had put himself in the middle, than it actually being helpful. I was the one working on something, but he was the one going to all meetings and talking with others. It made it harder for me, never being directly involved. Maybe it made him feel more useful, enjoying being the goto-guy etc?Then I got a new tech lead, and she was the one that made me realize what a manager could be. She encouraged me to own the stuff I was working on completely, and joined meetings more as a backup for me but wanted me to be the main point of contact. Instead of being the middleman of everything, she instead enabled me and mentored me.So I've always aimed to be like her. Now that I'm at 10 yeo experience, can I enable those "under" me and let them learn by allowing them to take on some of my responsibility? It's a constant conscious decision, because the default is to keep feeling important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would add:If there's anything worse than feeling bad at work, it's feeling bad because of not getting a job.Bad experiences at your workplace might make you want to quit without having another job offer lined up, and you might even feel good for the first 1-2 months.But do not underestimate how soul crushing it is to look at your savings go down while having your bills always on the back of your mind, and being constantly ghosted or rejected, for months, even for positions that sound literally aimed at your skillset or are basically the same of your last role.Just, don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42795646</guid></item><item><title>2.

So it'll just be LLMs trying to talk to each other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a scammer says "So, do you agree to sell me your car for $1000", and your script replies "Yes, it's a deal", and then the scammer tries to take you to court...Most courts would see the offer, acceptance, consideration and intent in that text message chat.    Standing up and arguing that it wasn't really you sending those messages but your wife/child/whatever might work...     But trying to argue that a computer program you wrote sent those messages, and therefore there was no intent behind them might be hard to prove or persuade the court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wasn't able to tell from skimming the repo, but have you considered adding a pseudorandom sleep? Might cost some more CPU cycles depending on how it's implemented, but would probably be more human-like than always responding in under minute&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42796496</guid></item><item><title>3.

I work with split terminal windows, where I have supporting windows to navigate the file system.Happy to try a file explorer once again, it’ll be interesting to see how I feel a year later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil for nvim is THE best explorer i have used. Highly recommend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of doing browsing in folders containing files as navigating between edit buffers.I've been editing like that since the 1990s because that's how Emacs and XEmacs do it (M-x dired command). The ease and speed of just pressing RETURN on the .. menu to go up or on the folder name to open and look inside is unrivalled and much faster than using my mouse (and better for health - avoids RSI).Would be cool for Helix to get Emacs-like directories-as-edit-buffers functionality!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42818278</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive map and detailed information about subway air rights in New York City, specifically focusing on the potential development opportunities above subway lines. It highlights various sites eligible for development, examines regulations related to air rights, and offers visual depictions of properties that can utilize these rights for construction. The site aims to inform developers, city planners, and the public about the viability and implications of building above subway infrastructure, alongside discussing the overall impact of such developments on urban density and city planning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm of the opinion that every 500k+ city should have a subway line.I grew up in a city with one (just one for the majority of my 20 years there) and if there's one thing I miss from that place it's the ability to move at an average speed of 35km/h at any time the trains were operating, especially at 2am on a Friday night after a couple of beers with the guys.The other thing I noticed when I was visiting my family there during the recent holidays is that there are so few cars in places close to the subway lines - roughly half the usual concentration. The incentive to have one is just not strong enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice effort and just shows you how far the art/science of dataviz has come with the ability of websites to work like realtime game engines.This is the same information visually expressed in a grid chart from 1983 by Edward Tufte (The Visual Display of Quantitative Information).  While the method can't scale the same way it feels like a more creative approach :https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VDQI-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this.  I agree with the "about" that it's visually compelling, and I'm mesmerized.This doesn't detract from my enjoyment the site, but for trip planning I'm a little skeptical of the results around the edges, especially when I'm assuming multiple transfers would be required (e.g., Local -&gt; Express -&gt; Express -&gt; Local).With a caveat this was over 10 years ago (~2012-2013), and train frequencies may have changed:I used to live pretty far up on the upper west side, and took the 1 train from the 103rd street station daily.  My weekday route was 1 -&gt; 2/3 -&gt; 7 into midtown.  The 20 minute radius is accurate at peak times, when it only takes 2-3 minutes to catch a transfer.  However, the website "about" makes an assumption this is for noon on a weekday.  I don't think I ever made it to Brooklyn in under 40 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42810293</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the game "Codenames" and its adaptation into an online format using artificial intelligence (AI). It explores how AI can enhance gameplay by providing smarter hints and improving the overall experience. The author reflects on the balance between maintaining the traditional elements of the game while leveraging technology to streamline play and accessibility, fostering a mix of strategic thinking and fun in both casual and competitive settings. Additionally, the piece touches on the implications of AI in social games and its potential to reshape interactions among players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42789670"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A small weakness in this test is that one of the keys to strategic Codenames play is understanding your partner. You're not just trying to connect the words, you're trying to connect them in a way that will be obvious to your partner. As a computing analogy: you're trying to serialize a few cards in a way that will be deserializable by the other player.This test pairs o1 with itself, which means the serializer is the deserializer. So while it's impressive that it can link 4 words, most humans could also easily link 4 with as much stretching! We just don't tend to because we can't guarantee that the other human will make the same connections we did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t find this “super good”. It’s mostly giving 2 clues which is the most basic level of competence. The paper 4 clue is reasonable but a bit lucky (eg Jack is also a good guess). I also don’t see it actually using tactics properly, which I would consider part of being “super good”. The game isn’t just about picking a good clue each round!Now obviously it’s still pretty decent at finding the clues. Probably better than a random human who hasn’t played much. Just I find the post’s level of hype overstated. It feels like the author isn’t very experienced with Codenames.It would be interesting to compare AI:human vs human:human games to see which does better. It seems like AI:AI will overstate its success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of these clues wouldn't be very good for a human playing. "007" for example isn't a very good clue for "laser", not only because something happening to be in one of several films about a character doesn't rise to the typical level of salience, but also because other words on-board like "shark" and "astronaut" even moreso meet the criterion of featuring prominently in James Bond movies, and "astronaut" appears to be a game-ending choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42789670</guid></item><item><title>7.

In other words: it's really far from certain.---One thing that is, however, quite certain: there are very real political reasons to favor one theory or another. For example, Sen. Tom Cotton is quoted as saying:&gt; “Now the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,” Mr. Cotton said.So... I'm not certain this is a development worth trusting. Maybe it really did originate from a lab! But the real goal of the constant back-and-forth over where it came from is not about finding the truth; that much seems quite obvious to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we actually care about public health, we should act as if both the lab leak and zoonosis theories are correct. We should take laboratory biosecurity, wet markets, the bush meat trade and intensive livestock management equally seriously as threats. We should do this because we have no idea where the next pandemic - and there will be a next pandemic - will come from.It seems fairly clear to me that a lot of people are much more concerned about finding someone to blame for the last pandemic than about preparing for or preventing the next pandemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42823385</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is like an automated version of 'Commercially Available Chairs in Star Trek' but for hotels. https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/database/chairs-trek.htm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO There is a huge gap for affordable hotels for normadic workers and business people.Hotel rooms suck when you need to use them for work. Typically there are massive beds and I travel alone if for work. There is no proper chair, no writing table at all or one too small, and the sockets tend to be in the wrong corner of the room.If I was an entrepreneur outside of software looking for a gap, I might have invented a hotel chain for work stays. But I'm not, so here is the idea for you to get rich with it (so I can stay there one day).I like the OP's idea of using ML models to gather intelligence from hotel photos. For years I took a photo of nearly every hotel room with my laptop on the desk so that I could go back and re-book the rooms that were suitable if there was a conference in the same city again in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why stop at just office chairs? Why not detect all categorizable objects in every photo and rank based on that?Could also crop just the object detection regions of each image, run those cropped images through CLIP/SigLIP, then UMAP and HDBSCAN to view a 2 or 3 dimensional latent space clustering of office chair types.. might reveal some info as to what kinds of chairs exist in what geographical regions. Could use a VLM to auto-tag each cluster given a couple images from each one. Could run PCA on the CLIP embeddings and have some sliders for each principal component.. maybe the first is chair color or size or whatevermuch data = much fun&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779330</guid></item><item><title>12.

At the start I’m sure she said something like “I just spent a couple of weeks alphabetising my dad’s record collection” and I remember that stressed me out at the time. Alphabetisation is like something that a non-collector does when confronted with a collection. I’m a dad who collects vinyl and know that my shelves have formed themselves into sense, slowly over time, and that there is a deep ordering – formed by shifting one record at a time after playing it – based on my taste and likes and preferences. So I can’t critique but it did make me a little sad at the time that the first thing she did was to wipe out the order her dad had left it in, which probably looked like chaos to her. What’s done is done though, I just know that once she gets to the end she might realise that there was a sense and logic to how it had been left.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I inherited 600+ jazz CDs and a couple of hundreds of LPs from my dad, who died 10 years ago - and like TFA, music is what we often connected over.Most (but not all!) of that music is available online.   But I listen to them now and then, in part for the linear experience that they offer, but also because they were his and meant a lot to him.  And they were physical items - if he had left me his Spotify account, I'd get no value out of it.Time to go put on some Grant Green..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791994</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So to my understanding, this work reproduces DeepSeek R1's reinforcement learning mechanism in a very small language model.The AI gets "rewards" (like points) for doing two things correctly:Accuracy : Getting the right answer. For example, math answers must be in a specific format (e.g., inside a box) so a computer can easily check them. For coding problems, test cases verify if the code works.Format : Using the &lt;think&gt; and &lt;answer&gt; tags properly. This forces the AI to organize its responses clearly.So in this case, the training program can extract the model's answer by parsing &lt;answer&gt; tag. We can eval the answer and evaluate if it's correct or not. If it's correct give reward, else: no reward.Create N such answers from a single question, create N reward array. This is enough for the RL algorithm to guide the model to be more smart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author notes in their Twitter announcement [a] that their model’s reasoning abilities are only validated within the domain directly within their the domain of their Countdown training material. They admit that the real test of this training method is whether it produces outputs that pass the sniff test in other subject domains, or even abstract reasoning. However, given that there are “standardized test style” abstract reasoning tests with relatively small corpora (eg. ZebraLogic [b]  on the order of 1000 or so cases), I do think they missed an opportunity to… do _some_ small benchmark for abstract reasoning before announcement.[a] https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1882839370505621655.html - thanks @Tepix[b] https://huggingface.co/blog/yuchenlin/zebra-logic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrolled non-X link with the announcement: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1882839370505621655.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42819262</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive guide to HTML elements, detailing every standard HTML tag along with their attributes, usage, and examples. It serves as a reference for web developers and designers to understand the structure and functionality of various HTML elements, helping them implement these tags effectively in their projects. The content is presented in an organized manner, making it easy to navigate and find specific information about each HTML element.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For people interested in this sort of thing, I recently published a blog post looking at counts of HTML tags and their attribute values from a 2.9B page Common Crawl dataset. [1]There's also a SQLite DB available to download of the top 1k tag+attr+value combinations. [2][1] https://webparsing.io/blog/hidden-in-html-parsing-page-layou...
[2] https://webparsing.io/data/commoncrawl-2024-11-html-tags-att...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very dismissive. Anyone not using &lt;span&gt; should take a second look. Of all the elements, this is the one to change font, size, color, etc. in any dynamic text without offsetting anything in your layout. Do you really want to throw your user's text inside a &lt;div&gt; inside your nice &lt;div&gt; layout? No.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this!It's fun to compare it to "A blog post with every HTML element" [1][2], which gets at a (very!) similar thing but in a very different way. This post primary shows, and is a little more chaotic (meant positively!) whereas the other post is much more prose and explanation heavy (also good, but very different).[1] https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-ht...[2] HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37104742&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42823722</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;Caltrain's new electric fleet is anticipated to be not only more efficient but also to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The electrification of the fleet aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve service frequency, and provide a quieter and cleaner travel option for passengers. The initiative is part of a broader effort to modernize public transit and support sustainability goals, ultimately improving the overall rider experience while contributing to environmental conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The electric Caltrain is so wonderful. It’s way quieter, the cars have nicer interiors, and it is running faster and more frequently than before.Between this, the new BART cars (also much quieter!), and Muni hitting a reliability &amp; satisfaction records, there’s really a transit renaissance going on in the Bay Area. I really hope we can keep this going!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's great, but it took more than 20 years to get here due to environmental reviews and shaky funding. ...and this was just re-fitting an existing, relatively short stretch of track!We (as Californians) have GOT to do better than this! There are huge infrastructure projects that we need to undertake in the coming years. We have got to cut the red tape and properly fund projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's good to hear. Especially since the electric trains accelerate so much faster than the Diesel ones did. Have you been next to one at takeoff? They're going about 40MPH before the train has traveled its own length. Probably limited more by standing passengers than power. Most of the energy used accelerating is recovered at the next stop, so the fast acceleration does not consume much energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42818692</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common belief that Rails applications are often I/O bound, meaning their performance issues stem primarily from input/output operations, such as database queries or file access. It critiques this notion by presenting evidence and examples that suggest many performance bottlenecks arise from inefficient code or suboptimal application design rather than inherent I/O limitations. The author emphasizes the importance of profiling and understanding specific application behaviors to effectively address performance concerns instead of defaulting to the assumption that I/O is the primary factor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another thing I have seen that sneaks up on dynamic scripting language programs is that maybe at first, your code is mostly blocked on database. You prototype something that mostly gets some stuff from the DB and blasts it out on optimized C-based code paths (like JSON encoding) without hardly even looking at it that are fairly fast.But then you need some authentication. And you need authorization, and more deeply than just "yea" or "nay" but doing non-trivial work to determine on some complex resource tree what is and is not permitted. And then you're taking a couple of queries and putting it together with some API call results in scripting code with some non-trivial logic. And then it grows beyond your dev prototype of 10 values to 100,000. And you use a few convenient features of your language without realizing the multiplicative slowdown they impose on your code. You add some automated plugins for turning DB values into these other things without realizing how much that takes. And you add some metadata-driven interpreter action based on what the user is asking for. And one feature at a time, you just keep stacking more and more on.And it can really sneak up on you, but in a mature scripting language codebase it's really easy for it to not just not be blocked on database IO, but for IO to ultimately be such a tiny portion of the runtime that even if the IO was completely free that you'd still have a slow page.Computers are very fast, and very good at what they do, and there's a lot of power to play with in a lot of cases... but it isn't always quite as much as programmers can think it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was skeptical given the title that the article could defend it's claim, but the article was strong and made great points.  The only thing I would add (which I concur probably doesn't belong in the article itself):Most databases make it trivial to see how long your queries are taking.  Use that to help you identify the performance bottlenecks!  If a request/response cycle takes 200 ms from the entrypoint of your rails server, and the database query reported (from the db) took 1 ms, that's a whole lot different than if the db query took 150 ms.On scaling in general, in my experience inefficient queries are the vast majority of performance problems for most apps.  It's usually fairly easy to identify these as different endpoint will perform very differently so you can get an idea of the baseline and identify aberrations.  If that's happening then check your queries.  If the whole app (baseline) is slow, TFA has phenonmenal guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fully spot on, that is why using Tcl with lots of native extensions might have been a great solution in the late 90's dotcom wave, we quickly validated with our rewrite into .NET, still beta at the time, the huge difference that having a JIT in the box makes.Hence why afterwards I never been a fan of any language for deployment production without AOT or JIT tooling on the reference implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42820419</guid></item><item><title>19.

"Fenwick tree" makes it seem like some unknown strange entity, while "binary indexed tree" immediately makes it a lot more accessible and gives you a better handle on the concept too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42818248</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an obscure instruction, the invalid 68030 instruction, that inadvertently enabled the Apple Macintosh Classic II to boot successfully. It explains how this instruction, although not formally recognized or functional within the intended architecture of the 68030 processor, created a loophole that allowed the Classic II to bypass certain hardware checks during start-up. The piece delves into the technical aspects of the instruction's execution, its implications for software and hardware behavior, and how this quirk inadvertently contributed to the Classic II's operational viability, showcasing an interesting intersection of software engineering and hardware design anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I’ve discovered an undocumented MC68030 instruction that performs a read-modify-write bus cycle and also changes the value of the A1 register.Rather than a "real" instruction that CPU designers consciously created and which was meant to do something useful but wasn't documented, it could just be that this is an illegal instruction and the logic in the CPU is doing whatever it happens to do when given don't-care inputs. (Maybe this is what the author meant, and I'm just catching up.)Normally the CPU would detect illegal instructions and cause an exception. This would mean there are certain situations where it doesn't.I found a manual at https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf. On page 8-9 of the manual (which is page 276 in the PDF file), it says:&gt; An illegal instruction is an instruction that contains any bit pattern in its first word that does not correspond to the bit pattern of the first word of a valid MC68030 instruction or is a MOVEC instruction with an undefined register specification field in the first extension word.Note "in its first word". According to the write-up, the instruction is 3 words long. The first word is normal, and the weird bits occur in the second word. So quite possibly the 68030 doesn't validate this second word, just plows forward with the logic that implements the CAS instruction, and lets whatever happens happen.(Great write-up and amazing dedication, by the way!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly all CPUs have undocumented instructions, and the 68k is no exception; it's just that the vast majority of people with enough interest and low-level knowledge at the time were focused on the x86/PC instead, which was arguably a far more open and stable architecture than Apple's. The 8088 and 8086 microcode was disassembled and studied extensively a few years ago, and I believe there's been some attempts at simulating it at the transistor level already. Even before that, the structure of the x86 opcode space was also explored in detail by many, with documents like these resulting from such effort:http://ref.x86asm.net/geek.htmlhttps://gist.github.com/seanjensengrey/f971c20d05d4d0efc0781...We don’t really know the exact details of what this instruction does. With some limited testing, I believe I’ve observed that the resulting value of A1 depends on the original A1 value, the value of A7, and the program counter. But I’m not sure. Maybe someone can make a program that tries out a bunch of different register values and memory contents, and attempt to deduce what exactly the instruction does so that it can be emulated accurately. Until someone decides that it’s worth trying to figure out, MAME is patching this bug out of the ROM in order to allow the Classic II to boot.IMHO this is definitely worth figuring out for accurate emulation. I'm not familiar with 68k but the bits in the instruction offer a good clue - my theory is that bits 5:3 of the 2nd word seem like another mode field, and instead of selecting one of the Dn registers via mode 000, 101 is selecting (d16, An) again and the Dc field, containing 001, is being interpreted as A1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAS has always been a bitch. I think I've received more bug reports about that instruction's emulation than any other instruction.Incidentally, I remember another old "bug" in King of Fighters that "incorrectly" checked the carry flag of the SBCD instruction, which it used to decrement the round timer and end the current round. Completely undocumented of course, but if you don't emulate the arithmetic status flags when doing binary coded decimal operations, the round timer in KOF will just keep on going forever, cycling from 00 to 99 :PSNK were really the gods of the 68000 chip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42824562</guid></item><item><title>21.

https://x.com/wongmjane/status/1882881778974937524This censorship is pretty interesting. Reading the post it also makes me wonder, are different censors provided depending on input language? Different models served to different regions? This can also get complicated due to the stochastic nature of model output, though the linked tweet appears to be post generation filtering. It's much harder to determine generation based filtering especially if done in subtle ways like just reducing the probability.I don't think this behavior is just limited to Chinese based models fwiw. A lack of transparency makes this space difficult to navigate. Though maybe the saving grace is that filtering is very hard, even meaning that it is hard to entirely remove certain subjects from pretraining data. (Have fun going through 10s of trillions of tokens)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw no attempts to make DeepSeek regurgitate content that is unspeakable in China, such as May 35th, Winnie The Pooh, etc.Such content seems ripe for glitch exploration.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/May_35thhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Winnie-the-Pooh_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tokenization is one of the reminders that we are far from reaching the optimal architecture, But something akin to the recent byte latent tokenization gives hope&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42824473</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses optimizing gradient descent, a fundamental algorithm used in machine learning for minimizing loss functions. It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate learning rates and introduces various optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), momentum, and adaptive learning rate methods like Adam. Additionally, it highlights common challenges associated with gradient descent, including overfitting and slow convergence, and provides practical tips for improving the effectiveness of the optimization process. The content serves as a guide for practitioners looking to enhance their machine learning models through better optimization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of SQL builders and argues that they are not always necessary for database interactions. It emphasizes that developers can achieve flexibility and maintainability in their code by using raw SQL queries, which can lead to better performance and a deeper understanding of the underlying database structure. The author also highlights the importance of knowing SQL basics and suggests that relying solely on abstractions may hinder one's ability to optimize and troubleshoot database operations. Overall, the piece advocates for a more hands-on approach to database management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems article shows the opposite argument. SQL builders are useful not to write fragile raw sql ridden with noisy filter patterns with repeated numbered placeholders which could be easily broken on refactoring. Also it's impossible to compose queries with abstracted parts.Shameless plug: https://github.com/baverman/sqlbind&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended approach is to generate SQL that looks like:    SELECT \* FROM users
    WHERE id = $1
        AND ($2 IS NULL OR username = $2)
        AND ($3 IS NULL OR age &gt; $3)
        AND ($4 IS NULL OR age &lt; $4)


It's worth noting that this approach has significant dangers for execution performance--it creates a significant chance that you'll get a query plan that doesn't match your actual query. See: https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/obfuscation/... for some related material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least for MSSQL: Never do this (before learning about query caches). Or at least, if you do, add (option recompile) to the query.For each combination of parameters to search for you may want to use a different index.But... the query plans are cached by query string lookup!So it is imperative that your search string looks different for each query plan/index being used.The code suggested here will pick a more or less random index (the one optimized for the parameters of the first execution) and stick with it for remaining executions, leading to bad queries for combinations of non-null that doesn't match the first query.You could just add a comment inside the string that was different depending on what parameters are null, but that is no less complex than just generating the query.PS: Of course there are situations where it fits, like if your strategy is to always use the same index to do the main scan and then filter away results from it based on postprocessing filters. Just make sure to understand this issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42778151</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a personal experience where the author failed to impress during a technical interview for a software engineering position, despite being familiar with the FizzBuzz coding challenge. The author reflects on the shortcomings of the interview process, emphasizing the pressure and expectations placed on candidates. They propose that focusing solely on technical skills can overlook important qualities such as problem-solving abilities, communication, and creativity. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a more holistic approach to interviews that allows candidates to demonstrate their full potential beyond standard coding tests.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a genuinely terrible interview. Seems like a great way to learn absolutely nothing about the candidate.I would have walked out half way through. These types of questions are very telling of an organization which is extremely insecure in its own abilities.For anyone who is a somewhat experienced programmer it is not hard to tell if someone else knows what he is talking about. You do not need to waste 45 minutes of someone's time on whether they can correctly interpret and execute some joke requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the article and would probably have hired this person. But as a suggestion to them: if an interviewer says "I don't think that will be a good idea" just take the hint that it won't be what the expect and change it.Also reminded me of my compiler class, we had some homework to write a pascal/C transpiler and a friend of mine somehow managed to implement it via bison errors(?). The teacher was not happy but had to agree it worked and gave him full marks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since I'm in the process of seeking a job, I would like to share a somehow related experience in one technical interview, this time for a senior DevOps role.
So, after the initial introductions and talking a bit about infra as code with Terraform, they interviewer asked a question:"What would you use if you cannot use Terraform for a project?"To which I initially answered, since it was a SENIOR position, with a warning about mixing Terraform and non-Terraform managed infra because it can lead to unforeseen issues, especially if there are less visible dependencies between the 2. I then mentioned anyway it could be done with Python + boto3, with AWS CLI + bash, with Pulumi, with CDK and then after some extra talk, also with Ansible.They didn't want a long answer with lessons learned in real prod, they wanted a oneliner answer: Ansible.
They told me then to be shorter in next answers and proceeded to ask like 30 questions in a row involving bash, Linux, Terraform and Kubernetes knowledge, to which I answered all correctly (and with the one-liner answer).The result: discarded, because I chaotically answered to that first question.
Although I was somehow offended because I don't like to be discarded, I think I dodged a bullet in this case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784699</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the efforts of researchers at UCSF to create a "silicon brain" by developing advanced neural interfaces and computational models that mimic the human brain's complex functions. It highlights the potential applications of this technology in understanding neurological disorders, enhancing cognitive abilities, and improving brain-computer interfaces. The researchers emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of this work, integrating neuroscience, engineering, and computer science to push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve in simulating human-like intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My main gripe with immutability is that making updated data requires building a full copy of the data again with the changes. Sure, you could have zippers to aid in the updating process by acting as a kind of cursor/pointer, but raw access to data beats them anytime (even if you optimize for cache).So if you had to optimize for raw speed, why not choose mutable data?https://ksvi.mff.cuni.cz/~sefl/papers/zippers.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immutability is a fantastic tool, especially when working with enterprise data. It's relatively easy to implement your own temporal tables on most existing databases, no special libraries or tools required. It seems really trivial/obvious, but I'll admit I first stumbled into the concept using the AS400 at work. If you make a mistake on payroll in IBM's old MAPICS program, you don't overwrite or delete it. You introduce a new "backout record" to nullify it, then (maybe) insert another record with the correct data. It seems obvious once you've seen the pattern.I've made a few non-technical eyes go wide by explaining A) that this is done and B) how it is done. The non-tech crypto/blockchain enthusiasts I've met get really excited when they learn you can make a set of data immutable without blockchain / merkle trees. Actually, explaining that is a good way to introduce the concept of a merkle tree / distributed ledger, and why "blockchain" is specifically for systems without a central authority.(Bi)Temporal and immutable tables are especially useful for things like HR, PTO, employee clock activity, etc. Helps keep things auditable and correct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the quote "accountants don't use erasers". So many things should be modeled over time and keep track of change right out the gate. Little things like Ruby on Rails always adding timestamps to model tables was super helpful but also a little code smell. If this is obvious enough to be useful everywhere, what is the next level? One more reason Datamoic is so cool: nothing is overwritten, it is overlayed with a newer record and you can always look back and you can always also always take a slice of the db at a specific time and have a complete and consistent viewbof the universe at that time. Immutability!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42824983</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article on We Distribute provides an early preview of "Loops," a forthcoming project that explores innovative collaborative practices in various fields. It discusses the underlying concept of the project, which aims to create a space for people to connect, share ideas, and develop new methodologies for collective work. It highlights the importance of community engagement, creativity, and shared knowledge in driving transformative change. The article encourages readers to get involved and share their experiences in collaborative practices that resonate with the project's vision.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kinda funny to read all these comments looking at a single-person's effort and going "he, he, he cannot win against the adtech billions and their addiction machines".What Pixelfed (and Loops and various other still half baked initiatives) prove is that there is an entire space of very interesting applications that are possible with the technologies of here and now. Bluesky was better resourced but essentially still in the same dwarf category versus big adtech.Some people will take these proof-of-principle efforts to heart and build a beautiful future while others will cling on milking the totally broken paradigms of yesteryear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My impression of the two demographics this targets (ie people that use TikTok and people that want to use decentralised social media) is that the set intersection of the two won’t be anywhere near the critical mass necessary to get a TikTok like algorithm working&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technological craftsmanship aside, I’m wondering, what’s the use case for these platforms?I don’t debate the value of long form written content (blogs) and video content (YouTube), but even these are mainly polluted with SEO garbage articles, or the same idea in 100 different videos, because the content creation machine needs to keep going.But what’s the real value of short form content like twitter/instagram/tiktok? You can’t convey a meaningful message in a limited amount words/seconds; you can’t use them as a diary or for sharing moments with people you love (I was toying with the idea of staying in instagram just to share pictures with my family, but there is no way I’m going to explain them how decentralized alternatives work); and they don’t have any decent monetization strategy other than ads, which means “influencers”, which means the same thing over again.So why do we keep recreating the same tools but with a twist of “decentralized” (which has no appeal to the average person, aside from some online “anarchist”/people who like technology [myself included])? What’s the value other than “for fun”/“decentralization”?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42820053</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses fault tolerance in tandem computer systems, focusing on their ability to maintain reliable operation despite failures. It outlines the design principles and mechanisms employed to achieve fault tolerance, including redundancy, error detection, and recovery procedures. The paper emphasizes the importance of these systems in critical applications where uninterrupted service is essential, and it delves into the technical aspects of implementing fault tolerance effectively, highlighting both challenges and potential solutions in tandem computing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things I like about this paper is the pristine, crystal-clear English it uses to describe things I thought I knew extremely well:&gt; Processes are the software analog of processors. They are the units of software modularity, service, failure and repair. The operating system kernel running in each processor provides multiple processes, each with a one gigabyte virtual address space. Processes in a processor may share memory, but for fault containment, and to allow processes to migrate to other processors for load balancing, sharing of data among processes is frowned upon. Rather, processes communicate via messages. They only share code segments."Processes are the software analog of processors." Yes of course. How easy it is to never ponder such a thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was an "operator" on a Tandem NonStop.  First was Pitney Bowes, I preferred the night shift. In the computer room, there was a Tandem, and a UNIVAC.  My job was mostly swapping disk packs on the Tandem, and swapping tapes on the UNIVAC.One of my jobs was to shutdown the dialup system (customers mailing machines would send data about the mailings they made overnight). I had to shutdown the dialup lines according to the time zones across Canada. I decided to write a script to automate it.  My script would shutdown each phone line in order.  The first time I ran it, I "broke" the Tandem.  My script was a basic loop.  It would check the time, and shutdown one of the timezones. First time I ran it the Tandem "mainframe" froze.  I had to call "Doug" in the middle of the night, I was freaking out.  Doug came in, looked at my script and quietly pointed out that the time command was a high priority system. My script didn't have any "waits" in it, the loop I wrote was constantly asking the system the time, taking up 100% of the processing.  "Doug" had to reboot the Tandem, and after the "wait" was put into my script, all was good.After I left Pitney Bowes I was an operator at the OPP (Ontario Provincial Police), that system had the OMPPAC system on it (Ontario Municipal Police Automated Cooperative), The criminal database for the Province of Ontario.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tandem was a special company for sure. My dad worked there in the 80s and 90s and said it was the best job he ever had.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42825126</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This happened a lot on old gaming forums where hacks were being produced.When I was much younger I looked up to a game cheats writer on an old forum since he taught me about how they worked, which I found extremely cool (still do!). It actually formed my initial interest in security.I asked if I could help somehow, as all young, eager noobs at the time did, and to my surprise he said yes. He wanted to track the licenses he sold to which accounts via IRC. The game would boot, hacks get injected, hacks connected to IRC and would interact with an mIRC bot to check them on his own machine. That was my first foray into socket programming and protocols, too.A while after that, I learned my code had been shared with another cheats maker (not itself a problem for me) when I was contacted to add DCC SEND support, which allowed sending files via IRC. I don't remember if I came to the conclusion myself or if it was explicitly stated, but either way, the objective was clear, and I refused. I felt bad, had learned my lesson, and never contributed to that scene again.That was in ca. 2006 or so. This has been going on for a long, long time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They talk about this like it's a new phenomenon but I distinctly remember this being super common in the windows 95 to vista days. Like I went to some kid's house and he would do something like try and tell everyone he knew how to 'hack google' and he used use some obviously sketchy as hell tool which just ran a whois on their domain to show their address, and this was all the evidence that he was 'hacking', and we all clowned on him for it and how he probably just installed a virus on himself. He ended up finding some extremely obvious viruses some kid thought would be funny to leave on a network share at school called something like 'sexyporn.jpg.exe' and getting expelled for being daft enough to execute them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In middle school we had a “computer” class where we’d learn how to type, as well as navigate a computer. This was Windows 2000 days.As a prank, my friends and I would do the following:* Hide all the icons on the desktop* Trigger an error message* Take a screenshot of the whole screen* Open the screenshot in MS Paint* Carefully paint over the error message to say “You’ve been hacked.”* Change the desktop background to be the screenshot above* Restore all the icons.You’d end up with a convincing looking error message that wouldn’t close, obviously.The next class, the teacher lectured us for 45 minutes on the definition of “script kiddy” vs. “real hacker” and how we should be embarrassed.This made the whole thing even funnier.It’s true though, I was a script kiddie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42821611</guid></item><item><title>33.

Until I’ve watched the game I keep off social media to avoid spoilers, and HN is one of the few things I’m very confident in reading knowing that nothing related to Arsenal FC would ever ever get posted here. Go figure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42821922</guid></item><item><title>37.

I had a 3G modem with a SIM card and it allowed more than the regular SMS app on your phone. Obviously I didn't have a whole app, just a simple CLI.For example, you could send class 0 SMS (flash) with it. The kind of SMS that shows up on your screen, and all you can do is click OK, and it just disappears.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5557135/sending-fullscre...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there something like this but for calls?Make your phone into an SIP/VoIP server? So that you can receive and make calls from any/many Internet clients while the Android phone with SIM is plugged in at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did something similar 20 years ago. Setup 4 Nokia phones with 4 SIM cards for the 4 different networks in Germany.It was possible to connect them via a serial cable to a linux machine and receive/send SMS.Used that to offer a horse betting service: people could bet on horses via complex SMS syntax. It worked, but never made enough money :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42818337</guid></item><item><title>39.

It was a hand-me-down from an aunt at the time when the C64 was the star of the show, and I only had 2 games for it. My only option was to learn how to program. It was so crude, that the thought of running something like Elite on it never even crossed my mind. I'm shocked someone actually went on and did that. Wow!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is Elite conceptually similar to Escape Velocity?I was so obsessed with this game as a kid, and the mods were super cool too!  Would love to learn the backstory behind the publisher, Ambrosia Software, about how they made so many great games in the 1990's.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elite is a masterpiece.Just going to plug my little galos project here for fun: https://github.com/nixpulvis/galos/tree/master/galos_map.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Texas's implementation of its state data privacy law, emphasizing the importance of strong data protection measures for consumers. It highlights how Texas's approach could serve as a model for other states in the U.S. to follow, advocating for the enforcement of similar privacy laws to enhance user rights and hold companies accountable for data misuse. The piece calls for a collective effort among states to prioritize data privacy legislation, reflecting the growing demand for better privacy protections across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the socio-economic issues facing North England, exploring historical and systemic reasons for its persistent poverty and underdevelopment compared to the South. It highlights factors such as the decline of traditional industries, lack of investment, political neglect, and regional inequalities that contribute to disparities in wealth, education, and opportunities. The author argues for a rethinking of policies and investments to revitalize the North, aiming to address the root causes of its economic struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's a fundamental gap in this analysis, which is how hyper-local many of the inequalities are.Manchester has a GDP per capita of £59,000. Tameside, the poorest area in Greater Manchester, has a GDP per capita of £19,000. Leeds has a GDP per capita of £42k; ten miles away, Bradford has a GDP per capita of £23.6k.Those disparities are really difficult to explain in terms of infrastructure or commercial investment. Similar disparities exist within London, although for plausibly different reasons; compare Lewisham with the neighbouring Southwark, Camden with Haringey, or that one bit of Tower Hamlets with the rest of Tower Hamlets.I think we need to be looking much more granularly at the gaps between neighbouring areas, schools and families - the human capital factors that trap people in lives of poverty. Building a university or innovation hub in Knowsley probably won't do much for the huge numbers of kids there who leave school unable to read and write.https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulle...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We also shifted largely into a service based economy, shutdown a lot of mines and mills (for better or for worse) which were primarily more north based.More than 2/3rds of my graduating physics class went straight into banking, as there was no relevant industry to pick them up... and as someone with several postdoctoral degrees, yet no house or meaningful assets... who could blame them for going into banking in this large miserable sprawl of a city utterly devoted to it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author says that the region is poor because, after the decline of industry, it didn’t have universities to drive tech, finance and services. But it sounds like the problem is simply deindustrialization in the first place, same as the US Rust Belt.Material wealth means having stuff. You can only get stuff by making it or taking it from the earth.Meanwhile Chinese cities are sparkling and new, and their workers enjoy a high standard of living at low cost, not unlike Northern England or Cleveland, Ohio 100 years ago.Because they make a lot of stuff. It’s that simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42822825</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advancements and findings related to the black hole M87 one year after the initial release of its image by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). It highlights the turbulent accretion flow of matter around the black hole, providing insights into its dynamics and the implications for our understanding of black holes in general. The piece emphasizes the ongoing research efforts and observations that continue to refine our knowledge of black hole behavior and the surrounding environment, showcasing the significance of the EHT's work in astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;

We found that the latter case is more likely to match the multi-year observations thanks to their relatively higher turbulent variability”The direction the black hole is rotating makes a difference due to frame dragging.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42796298</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the input latency issues associated with the Wayland display server protocol compared to the X11 system. It highlights the impact of various factors on latency, such as compositor configurations, input device drivers, and rendering techniques. The author provides insights into measuring and improving input responsiveness, offering suggestions for both users and developers to mitigate latency problems and enhance overall performance in Wayland environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent. Too often people guess at things when they could be more empirical about them. Ever since I learned the scientific method (I think 3rd or 4th grade) I was all about the 'let's design an experiment' :-).Let me state up front that I have no idea why Wayland would have this additional latency. That said, having been active in the computer community at the 'birth' of X11 (yes I'm that old) I can tell you that there was, especially early on, a constant whine about screen latency. Whether it was cursor response or xterm scrolling. When "workstations" became a thing, they sometimes had explicit display hardware for just the mouse because that would cut out the latency of rendering the mouse in the frame. (not to mention the infamous XOR patent[1])As a result of all this whinging, the code paths that were between keyboard/mouse input and their effect on the screen, were constantly being evaluated for ways to "speed them up and reduce latency." Wayland, being something relatively "new" compared to X11, has not had this level of scrutiny for as long. I'm looking forward to folks fixing it though.[1] https://patents.google.com/patent/US4197590&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone who uses ffmpeg for this type of per frame analysis, `ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file -vsync 0 -frame_pts true out%d.png` will get the "presentation time" of each frame in the video. That's more precise than just dumping frames and calculating timestamps. You can also do something similar in a web browser by playing a &lt;video&gt; and using `requestVideoFrameCallback()`. Though, you might need to set `.playbackRate` to a low value if the computer can't decode all the frames fast enough.&gt; With my 144Hz screen,....Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system...Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh. I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.The fact that the latency is almost 1/144th of a second means that it might become 1/60th of a second on standard 60Hz monitors. This is hard to notice consciously without training, but most people can "feel" the difference even if they can't explain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that the results will differ between compositors, different GPUs, and different configurations. This is somewhat less the case with X11 since there is only one X server implementation (that Linux desktop systems use, anyhow.)I think there may still be the issue that many compositor/GPU combinations don't get hardware cursor planes, which would definitely cause a latency discrepancy like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831509</guid></item><item><title>2.

In the final days of the war he and his drill sergeant stole a helicopter as Saigon fell and flew west, expecting to keep fighting. They wound up in a refugee camp in Thailand and eventually made it to the US. He wouldn't see his family again until Clinton normalized relations with Vietnam 20 years later.In those final moments, soldiers who knew how to fly took whatever aircraft they could get their hands on, (Chinooks, Hueys, Cessnas, etc.) and flew aimlessly, hoping to run into friendly forces along the way before their fuel ran out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The photo of a man carrying a baby and a woman by his side in the article is not of Buang Ly.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The user experience is so (paradoxically) refreshing. Back then you could fit so much useful information and controls into a single screenful; interfaces responded instantly; it was easy to figure where things are and what I'm looking at. With "modern" UIs, you can't get a big picture of what you're working on because there is so much white space and scrolling; the application is slower than your fingers; with each application, you have to learn the designer's "vision" in order to figure out where things are and what you're looking at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's pretty cool that the source code is all in a single file called app.js, and it's just doing simple DOM manipulations, no React, no minification, no libraries. I like to think it's just written like that too, a gigantic file that the author just iterates on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange how people are always so negative. Always with the nitpicking. Functionally of course 90s style UX and desktop productivity has always been far higher. Palantir's blueprint UI doesn't even specifically target mobile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42826171</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the skepticism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in writing and creative fields, emphasizing the potential for AI-generated content to lack genuine insight and nuance. The author reflects on the nature of writing and the value of human experience and emotion, arguing that while AI can assist in producing text, it may lead to homogenization and superficiality. The piece encourages a critical approach to adopting AI in creative processes, advocating for a balance that preserves the unique qualities of human storytelling while exploring the capabilities of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My gripes with AI slop:* Insincerity. I would prefer a disclaimer that you posted AI generated content than presenting it as your own words.* Imbalance of efforts. If you didn't take the effort to write to me with your own words then you are robbing me of my efforts of reading what your AI assistant wrote.* We have access to the same AI assistants. Don't try to sell me your AI assistants "insights" as your own insights. I can interact with the same AI assistant to gather the same insights.Notice that the quality of the AI output is mostly irrelevant for these points. If you have good quality AI outputs then you are still welcome to share it with me, given that you are upfront that it is AI generated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I empathize with the obsession (we all have some obsessive behaviors we’re not thrilled with) but I question the utility.It feels like some kind of negative appeal to authority: if the words were touched by an AI, they are less credible, and therefore it pays to detect AI as part of a heuristic to determine quality.But… what if the writer just isn’t a native speaker of your language? Or is a math genius but weak with language? Or…IMO human content is so variable in quality that it is incumbent on readers to evaluate based on content, not provenance. Using an author’s tools, or ethnicity, or sociowhatever as a proxy for quality doesn’t seem healthy or productive at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Content that is mostly-or-completely AI-generated that is passed off as being written by a human, regardless of quality.I think something does not necessarily need to be "passed off as being written by a human" -- whether covertly, implicitly or explicitly -- to qyalify as AI slop.There are ample examples of content sites and news articles etc that shamelessly post AI generated content -- without actively trying to claim it as human generated. Some sites may even have a disclaimer that they might sometimes use AI tools.Still slop is slop becuase we are subjected to it and have to be wary of it, filter through it to separate low quality low effort content, expend mental energy in all this while feeling powerless etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42827532</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're attending a large-scale protest, it's likely that the cell-towers (or stingrays) won't be able to handle everyone who is connected anyways, so worth planning to use apps that can chat over P2P WiFi or Bluetooth together with the rest of your friends. This also allows you to continue using Airplane Mode the entire time, while being able to communicate with people nearby.Alternatively, investing in walkie-talkies that have encryption can be worth it as well, but unsure how legal they are around the world, think some countries put restrictions on those so you might have to acquire them while vacationing somewhere else.It's mentioned in the body of the article, but get the feeling most people could miss it: Absolute best idea is to leave your "personal" phone at home! Either get a secondary (burner) phone with nothing useful on it and no real names, or skip out on the phone fully. If you do get a secondary phone, make sure it has a removable battery and keep it out from the phone until you arrive at location and as soon as you move, remove battery again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also Meshtastic.org is a cheap (various &lt;$50 options) open source LoRa based hardware bridge (or standalone device) that can be used with an app over bluetooth (or WiFi web interface).It supports strong encryption layer and over 1 km/mile per “hop” in most circumstances.Designed originally for off grid, it’s very flexible and pretty polished.Abstracts your phone into a UI. Has a whole ecosystem behind it. I’ve been using it for festivals and tracking my vehicles (high theft area) for years.Very handy should infra not be available. Should be great for protests also :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately this is a topic that attracts LARPers. Remember that if things get spicy, you are not going to settings nerd your way out of a bad interaction with the police.Tech advice for legal and illegal protests is pretty much diametrically opposite, and advice for countries like the United States is much different than for somewhere like Egypt.It's complicated!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829317</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone should author an ELI5 (or slightly older) guide to how LLMs, RL, Agents, CoT, etc, all work and what all these acronyms mean. And then, add to it, daily or weekly, as new development arise. I don't want to keep reading dozens of articles, white papers, tweets, etc, as new developments happen. I want to go back to the same knowledge base, that's authored by the same person (or people), that maintains a consistent reading and comprehension level, and builds on prior points.It seems like the AI space is moving impossibly fast, and its just ridiculously hard to keep up unless 1) you work in this space, 2) are very comfortable with the technology behind it, so you can jump in at any point and understand it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People keep saying that DeepSeek R1's training cost is just $5.6M. Where is the source?I'm not asking for the proof. Just the source, even a self-claimed statement. I've read the R1's paper and it doesn't say the number of $5.6M. Is it somewhere in DeepSeek's press release?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Most important, R1 shut down some very complex ideas (like DPO &amp; MCTS) and showed that the path forward is simple, basic RL.

This isn't quite true. R1 used a mix of RL and supervised fine-tuning. The data used for supervised fine-tuning may have been model-generated, but the paper implies it was human-curated: they kept only the 'correct' answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42827601</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the simplicity and elegance of the Prolog programming language, emphasizing its declarative nature and logic-based approach to problem-solving. It highlights how Prolog allows developers to express complex problems in straightforward terms, enabling more intuitive coding compared to imperative languages. The author provides examples to illustrate Prolog's syntax and functionality, showcasing its strengths in areas like artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a long standing love affair with Prolog and frustration for its failure to grow.  Prolog has poor features for abstraction and is actually not declarative enough!Prolog's limitations can be great for starting to get the paradigm but then you hit a wall.  (Kind of like standard Pascal!)Mercury and Curry fix some of these limitations as does miniKanren. Integrating CLP is important yet so far always clumsy as standard Prolog provides no way to reify the environment.Some LP resources:https://minikanren.org/https://mercurylang.org/https://www.curry-lang.org/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programminghttps://logtalk.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a long forgotten past a large part of my graduation was Prolog (I was as far ahead then as i'm behind now with the ol' AI thing; I worked on mixing neural nets, reasoning with uncertainty with Prolog at the time) and, after hallucinatory episodes living, sleeping, (day)dreaming in Prolog for months on end, when something was finished I was always so surprised how clean, readable and 'too little' the code looked for what it did. Once you really grok it, it's a magic tool. I replaced it with Common Lisp after (in my uni, there was no mention of Lisp; we didn't even know it existed basically besides some weird scribbles in papers which were easy enough to study so we didn't give it more thought) and have the same feelings/experiences there but CL is usable for basically anything, including logic programming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The reverse predicate from this section should not be used in practice - most Prolog implementations actually provide a built-in version which is a lot more performant than our implementation.That feels like cheating. If you shouldn't use the implementation shown, then why do you even show it? Let us see the performant version!That's like Haskell's quickSort implementation in a couple of lines... beautiful but horrendously non-performant as it doesn't actually implement the algorithm, it just implements the "idea" (while losing all the performance of the actual algorithm, which requires in-place mutation).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42827335</guid></item><item><title>8.

The posts use DuckDB as the query engine, but you could swap in Trino (or even chdb / clickhouse).0 - https://www.definite.app/blog/cloud-iceberg-duckdb-aws1 - https://www.definite.app/blog/cloud-iceberg-duckdb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think iceberg solves a lot of big data problems, for handling huge amounts of data on blob storage, including partitioning, compaction and ACID semantics.I really like the way the catalog standard can decouple underlying storage as well.My biggest concern is how inaccessible the implementations are, Java / spark has the only mature implementation right now,Even DuckDB doesn’t support writing yet.I built out a tool to stream data to iceberg which uses the python iceberg client:https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/streaming-iceberg-using-sqlfl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hidden partitioning is the most interesting Iceberg feature, because most of the very large datasets are timeseries fact tables.I don't remember seeing that in Delta Lake [1], which is probably because the industry standard benchmarks use date as a column (tpc-h) or join date as a dimension table (tpc-ds) and do not use timestamp ranges instead of dates.[1] - https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/490&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799388</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;YC Graveyard is a platform that tracks startups that were incubated by Y Combinator but ultimately shut down. It provides a comprehensive list of these failed companies, detailing their founding years, reasons for closure, and the lessons learned from their journeys.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are not just startups that become unicorns and startups that fold.Investors' worst nightmare is if you just make enough money to keep going, but you don't grow ("lifestyle business" as they use it is a derogatory term).That's because they prefer a sudden death where they can write down the investment and deduct their loss from taxes than an investment where they never see any money again.And then there are "acquisitions" that are really "acui-hires" dressed up as acquisitions to get the people (more common) or to buy an asset in a limited shell package (less common) after things did/may have (but people were to tempted to take the offer) or did not pan/panned out. Some people consider anything &lt;$50m as a "failure", because that's roughly the sum that many corporations can spend without calling the bigshots for a board meeting to decide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally know the founders of three YC startups that are functionally dead (raised capital, not developing anything, basically laid off everyone but the founder(s)) but are not on this list. I'd bet it's at least twice that number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love seeing the 'YC Graveyard' project. It’s a great reminder of the incredible ideas and effort behind each startup, even if things didn’t pan out. We’ve been working on giving some of these inactive startups a second chance by acquiring them and exploring ways to repurpose or revive their tech.If anyone’s been involved with an inactive YC project and wants to chat about what’s possible, I’d love to connect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828198</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the problematic launch of Microsoft's Copilot feature for Microsoft 365, highlighting various issues such as technical glitches, user confusion, and mismatched expectations between the company and its users. It critiques Microsoft's rushed implementation of the feature, which was intended to enhance productivity by leveraging AI but instead led to frustration among users. The author emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and clear communication in the introduction of new technology to avoid alienating potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hate that if you use Word for Mac, you now have Copilot next to your cursor with no way of turning it off.I just want to use Word. I like its print layout features better than Pages. I don't want to switch. Just let me write and leave me alone. Now they're jamming AI down my throat without any opt-out mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My problem with this isn't the price increase. It's the blurring of what used to be a clearly understandable suite of products (e.g. Office) and services (e.g. OneDrive) into a soup of weird AI and cloud stuff that all goes under a single unhelpful name (Copilot). My mental model of what I'm actually purchasing is broken in this new paradigm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 years of their home name Office brand, known by pretty much every person that's ever had a computerlet's get rid of that, and make the unreliable bullshit generator the main brand insteadcertainly a courageous decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831281</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implications of a recent advancement in plant-based food technology, particularly focusing on a new potato variety designed for chip production. It highlights the potato's genetic modifications aimed at increasing its carbohydrate content for better frying performance, while also considering the environmental and health aspects of such innovations. The piece further examines consumer perception and demand for sustainable and healthier snack options, alongside the challenges of integrating these new crops into existing agricultural practices. Additionally, it explores the balance between enhancing crop productivity and maintaining biodiversity in food systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a terrible article. The title and the first paragraph talk about how new business models are circumventing existing laws, which seems fair enough and actually quite an interesting subject.Then, there is a switch to the most traditional of businesses with the most traditional business models. Who, the author argues, are engaging in price gauging. In the second paragraph he claims that apps cause this inflation ("so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app"), then goes on to list a couple of traditional companies who are, he argues rising prices above inflation. And who he partially blames for inflation.None of the examples he gives support the case he is trying to make in his title. Apparently being an "App" has absolutely zero to do with getting away with financial misdeeds.None of the questions raised by the title are even investigated. And the core argument, that traditional companies are causing inflation, is never argued for. The last paragraph portraits a stunning lack of economic knowledge, as companies raising prices in line with inflation obviously would not lower prices after the source of the inflation is gone. The source of the inflation being gone does not cause inflation to reverse. And so the fair market price would not get lower, getting something so basic wrong seems ridiculous for someone leveling serious accusations at companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is all a result of a lack of active market regulation. The government needs to step in actively to keep a free market from collapsing into one of the  natural end states. But the US has consistently been far too passive and accepts greedy companies far too readily.If a single company can sell almost 100% of an essential good, they need to atomatically lose the power to set their prices and margins independently. Let them go through a cumbersome govenment approval process for price changes or something to cap margins. Price fixing cartels need to be busted more aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade&gt; Inflation has lots of causes, it's true.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SLAlgorithmic price fixing is certainly a not-insignificant part of the issue.  But it's strange to see zero acknowledgement of the massive increase in money supply over the same time period.  When doing causal analysis, we need to examine both the private sector and our government.When you use M2 as denominator for egg prices, we're at the same place we were in early 2016: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DcVw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830646</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real thing that surprises me (as a layman trying to get up to speed on this stuff) is that there's no "trick" to it. It really just does seem to be a textbook application of RL to LLMs.Going from a base LLM to human instruction-tuned (SFT) ones is definitely an ingenious leap where it's not obvious that you'd get anything meaningful. But when we quickly saw afterwards that prompting for chain of thought improved performance, why wasn't this the immediate next step that everyone took. It seems like even after the release of o1 the trick wasn't apparent to everyone, and if it wasn't for DeepSeek people still might not have realized it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a whole bunch of people who claimed LLMs can't reason at all and that everything is a regurgitation. I wonder what they have to say about this. Like, what exactly is going on here with chain of thought reasoning from their expert perspective?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LOL, my RL professor is gonna be happy. After the field got overlooked for soooo long&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42827399</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers announced the reclassification of an object initially identified as an asteroid, which turned out to be Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster. The object was flagged as a potential asteroid but was later confirmed to be the car launched into space aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2018. This revelation highlights the challenges and complexities in identifying and categorizing near-Earth objects, as well as the unique influence of space missions on the solar system's environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Wouldn't adding it to the database at least reduce the chance of the same mistake being made again by other astronomers?Isn't this, like other space junk in such orbits, effectively an "anthropogenic asteroid"? Why not just add them in with a special tag or naming convention to indicate that they're man-made?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I buy into the sensationalism behind this story. We're tracking billions[0] of asteroids in interplanetary space, and you say that it's a data-processing hazard that the half-dozen or so deep-space anthropogenic objects aren't  submitted to a mandatory international database for de-confliction?

K8s is hard enough to get right as is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to be fascinated by the automation power of Kubernetes custom components. The declarative approach and reconciliation loop offers so many possibilities for creating higher level descriptions of domain specific infrastructure.On reflection though, I think this stuff can lead to a lot of complexity layers which don't benefit the product relative to the time investment. You are probably not Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At work we are using Metacontroller to implement our "operators". Quoted because these are not real operators but rather Metacontroller plugins, written in Python. All the watch and update logic - plus the resource caching - is outsourced to Metacontroller (which is written in Go). We define - via its CompositeController or DecoratorController CRDs - what kind of resources it should watch and which web service it should call into when it detects a change. The web service speaks plain HTTP (or HTTPS if you want).In case of a CompositeController, the web service gets the created/updated/deleted parent resource and any already existing child resources (initially none). The web service then analyzes the parent and existing children, then responds with the list of child resources whose existence and state Metacontroller should ensure in the cluster. If something is left out from the response compared to a previous response, it is deleted.Things we implemented using this pattern:- Project: declarative description of a company project, child resources include a namespace, service account, IAM role, SMB/S3/FSX PVs and PVCs generated for project volumes (defined under spec.volumes in the Project CR), ingresses for a set of standard apps- Job: high-level description of a DAG of containers, the web service works as a compiler which translates this high-level description into an Argo Workflow (this will be the child)- Container: defines a dev container, expands into a pod running an sshd and a Contour HTTPProxy (TCP proxy) which forwards TLS-wrapped SSH traffic to the sshd service- KeycloakClient: here the web service is not pure - it talks to the Keycloak Admin REST API and creates/updates a client in Keycloak whose parameters are given by the CRD specSo far this works pretty well and makes writing controllers a breeze - at least compared to the standard kubebuilder approach.https://metacontroller.github.io/metacontroller/intro.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42798230</guid></item><item><title>18.

No comparison to any used alternatives in the article. And only using "unusually legible" isn't that relevant for the… usual cases&gt; This is basically perfect,I’ve counted at least 5 errors on the first line, how is this anywhere close to perfection???Same with translation: first, is this an obscure text that has no existing translation to compare the accuracy to instead of relying on your own poor knowledge? Second, what about existing tools?&gt; which I hadn’t considered as being relevant to understanding a specific early modern map, but which, on reflection, actually are (the Peter Burke book on the Renaissance sense of the past).How?&gt; Does this replace the actual reading required? Not at all.With seemingly irrelevant books like the previous one, yes, it does, the poor student has a rather limited time budget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to read way more stuff like this. There are plenty of people writing about LLMs from a computer science point of view, but I'm much more interested in hearing from people in fields like this one (academic history) who are vigorously exploring applications of these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a showcase of exactly what LLMs are good at.Handwriting recognition, a classic neural network application, and surfacing information and ideas, however flawed, that one may not have had themselves.This is really cool.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that despite the rise of fintech companies and technological advancements, traditional banks are not being significantly disrupted. It highlights the resilience of the banking sector, which continues to maintain its foundational role in the financial system. The piece discusses how banks are adapting by integrating new technologies and collaborating with fintech firms rather than being overtaken by them. It emphasizes that, while fintech innovations enhance certain services, they often complement rather than replace traditional banking practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The products being pointed out in this article as an attempt to disrupt banks seem to be basically the same product for a different price. Like, a high-yield savings account is just a savings account with a better price, right? How do you disrupt an industry by selling the same products? The advantage of startups is that they're more nimble, can pivot to fit the market better, and can adapt to customer requests faster. None of that applies to "selling the same product at a lower price", especially for savings accounts where stability ("the company not suddenly disappearing") is an important part of the pitch anyway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No one is disrupting banks because the mega banks have the sole power of creating credit out of thin air, and no upstart fintech company has this power. To gain this power requires the creation of a bank, which as you can imagine, is probably the  most gate-kept activity on earth.Andreesen talked about this in his Rogan appearance. The banks and gov brought the hammer down on crypto because it was a legitimate threat to the banking cabal which runs the American Empire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think disrupting banks is even possible. The time, money, and energy required is simply not realistic. There’s so many disrupt-able industries out there and I’m not even sure banking is the most beneficial one to tackle.It’s a realistic Star Wars story where the Empire always wins because… well it’s the fucking empire.

So, mock them for pretending their laptop is an iPad.Good one. I actually have a touchscreen on my laptop but I almost never use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Okay, let's tackle this roast based on the user's data. First, I need to pick the three most unusual bits. The user is using Safari 17.6 on Mac OS 10.15.7. Wait, macOS 10.15 is Catalina, which is pretty old now—like from 2019. That's a bit outdated, so that's unusual. Next, the screen resolution is 1024x1366. That's a taller screen than usual. Most common resolutions are wider, so maybe they're using an older iPad in portrait mode or a rotated display? That's quirky. Referrer is empty, meaning they came directly here. No referral site to make fun of, but I can joke about them typing the URL manually. Also, their location is Calgary, Canada. Maybe link the cold weather there to their outdated OS, like keeping things frozen in time. Combine all that into three concise sentences. Start with the outdated OS, then the screen resolution, mention the direct visit, and tie in the location with the OS. Make sure it's funny but not mean. Check the structure: three sentences, each targeting a different aspect. Let me put it all together.&gt; Roast: Ah, a Canadian Safari-saddled NPC from Calgary, still clinging to Mac OS 10.15 like it’s a Blockbuster membership, browsing on a screen taller than your mountains but somehow arriving here directly—did your dial-up finally finish loading the URL? (Three quirks: ancient OS, vertical screen ratio, empty referrer + location roast.)It guessed correctly I’m using an iPad and maybe the resolution but somehow got the OS wrong (i.e. if I’m on an iPad I’m not using MacOS). I am still on iOS 17 so it got that I’m not on the latest but made a mistake since 10.15 is the latest MacOS release.

I would've thought that the arch-enemy of computer graphics (at least the raster-display kind) might have gotten more of a mention!?It also seemed odd to not really talk about 'filtering' and (at least from a brief investigation) it doesn't seem to really concern itself much with pixels at all! Maybe that's why there's a section titled "Rendering is Very Hard"?) Edit: I read-on from there a bit and this turns out to be about algorithmic complexity side of the rendering equation and not that it's hard to talk about pixels! fair enough! this document still seems more about CG in-the-abstract than the practical to me!At least 'smootherstep()' got a mention, although what about 'smootheststep()'!?

They should work reliably and predictably like every good procduct. Everyone wants something simple until they want to do something that's not supported because it's not a simple use case.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article but it seems to have a fatal flaw.As pointed out in the article, Nvidia has several advantages including:   - Better Linux drivers than AMD
   - CUDA
   - pytorch is optimized for Nvidia
   - High-speed interconnect

Each of the advantages is under attack:   - George Hotz is making better drivers for AMD
   - MLX, Triton, JAX: Higher level abstractions that compile down to CUDA
   - Cerbras and Groq solve the interconnect problem

The article concludes that NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats. The flaw in the analysis is that these threats are not unified. Any serious competitor must address ALL of Nvidia's advantages. Instead Nvidia is being attacked by multiple disconnected competitors, and each of those competitors is only attacking one Nvidia advantage at a time. Even if each of those attacks are individually successful, Nvidia will remain the only company that has ALL of the advantages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge.I was under the impression that this was not how MoE models work. They are not a collection of independent models, but instead a way of routing to a subset of active parameters at each layer.  There is no "expert" that is loaded or unloaded per question. All of the weights are loaded in VRAM, its just a matter of which are actually loaded to the registers for calculation.  As far as I could tell from the Deepseek v3/v2 papers, their MoE approach follows this instead of being an explicit collection of experts. If thats the case, theres no VRAM saving to be had using an MOE nor an ability to extract the weights of the expert to run locally (aside from distillation or similar).If there is someone more versed on the construction of MoE architectures I would love some help understanding what I missed here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is excellent writing.Even if you have no interest at all in stock market shorting strategies there is plenty of meaty technical content in here, including some of the clearest summaries I've seen anywhere of the interesting ideas from the DeepSeek v3 and R1 papers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42822162</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s fascinating that this could either be beneficial to bacteria, by forming larger bodies and making it more difficult to be attacked by immune systems, or detrimental, by clumping up and then being cleaned up by hairs within the body, such as the lungs. I imagine the answer is both, depending on the context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I make kombucha* at home and observe something similar whenever I start a new batch using a small piece of culture taken from an old container. Either the yeast or the bacteria - or both in symbiosis - form the typical stringy structures seen in so many petri dishes, that radiate from the "mother" outwards to the edges of the container. As time passes, each area isolated between the crossing strings slowly thickens on the surface and eventually merge with the rest of the growth as a single colony.* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42805777</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of dualities in various aspects of life, particularly focusing on the interplay between contrasting elements such as light and dark, good and evil, and freedom and constraint. It emphasizes that these dualities are essential for understanding the complexity of existence and highlights how they can be harmonious rather than oppositional. The discussion encourages readers to embrace the dual nature of experiences, recognizing that both sides coexist and contribute to a fuller understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this and have a similar frame of mind. I wish more languages would make their sum types true duals of their structs (with a single payload datum - instead we have tuple variants and structure variants and so-on complicating matters for at best a character of syntax (but careful design could eliminate even that).The author may be interested in coeffects as the dual of effects. They are pretty much as stated: coeffects are the context environment the that program executes in. This link has some prototypes of languages that let you create coeffects in your code: https://tomasp.net/coeffects/I was going to bring up covariance vs contravariance but the author mentions they were skipped for brevity.Finally I really think simplifying to the point we ignore the idea of consumed-produced values is unfortunate. Consider how “inout” parameters aren’t too much different to a mutable reference (though the change in binding may be more explicit in a pure functional language). From the article it’s pretty clear why inout/reference parameters need to be invariant (both covariant and contravariant). And there is a whole lot that this kind of reasoning can bring to understanding Rust’s borrow checker and possibly how to create something simpler with the same strengths. But for that we’d need to model immutable references, unique mutable references and dare I say also volatile references (the environment IS volatile, whether it’s your physical peripherals or your application database, and IMO not having a language construct for that makes life harder than needs be).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason null values are a problem is because most compilers do not track the difference between a nullable and a nonnullable type. If they would, then null values would indeed be similar to Nothing in the maybe type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a similar duality between “require” and “provide” that I’ve been trying to work more with recently. The idea that we can require some behavior verified via a test and also provide that behavior via a fake might mean that the two can be unified (test is the dual of fake, so maybe you can get tests and fakes from the same code, that’s the hope anyways).Identifying a duality means that there might be some opportunity to transfer or unify concepts, but they might not be strong enough, or the duality isn’t pure enough to be very useful. The obvious dual of a precondition is not effect, but postcondition (like require/provide, import/export, in/out, etc…). So I’m having a hard time seeing the fruit of calling precondition and effect a dual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42805583</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see how the author came to the conclusion that libmodem written in rust would have prevented the issue, but isn't it simply pushing the problem further down the stack?The author needed to use unsafe in order to pass his pointer to libmodem, but libmodem is going to require a pointer with static lifetime itself. Which would have prevented the issue in the first place had the author done this.I can see why you wouldn't want to use static, it hinders testability, but that means you need to ensure that the pointer you supply libmodem outlives libmodem. I would use RAII to do that in C++ and I am sure in rust you could/would do the same.I guess I am asking, is there anything here that a libmodem written in rust would have magically solved? It feels like wishful thinking, but I am open to learn where I am mistaken.In any case, kudos for finding this bug. Having worked with Zephyr/NRF connect SDK and this exact chip myself I can definitely relate to the pain they (can) bring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if libmodem were written in rust, since they ship it as a blob, it would have to use the C ABI and you could easily have the same problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caution: I'm a C programmer "by history" and therefore I see "C Interfaces" as that and don't always / immediately view them through the rust lens of ownership...Reading the article (nice troubleshooting story!), my summary, as a C programmer, is that the "C Interface" here "takes ownership". Given C cannot express this properly, a pointer is passed - and the called function "simply" makes the assumption that from hence-on, what was given to it will remain.As "semantics" this (the need to pass an "owned" piece of data to a function) isn't unusual irrespective of the programming language. Just in case of Rust, this is explicit in the interface (if the func takes a non-ref arg, or a shared smart ref of sorts), while in C ... this can lead to errors of the observed kind. I haven't looked whether any of the sources or docs of libmodem say "this pointer must be either global/static or malloc'ed (and the caller shall not free it)".A rust wrapper for this could / should possibly "leak a reference" here; Something that prevents the initialisation object from being dropped. yea, accepted, needs "nasty hacks" whether static lifetime, Pin, manual drops, explicit Arc leaks, ... possible though.It'd be nice if libmodem were stricter about such ownership, agreed, and then a rust wrapper could take advantage. Takes time to evolve; is there a bug report / enhancement request out there for this in libmodem ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791874</guid></item><item><title>32. 100 years of Bell Labs [pdf]</title><link>https://novitoll.com/posts/2025-1-25/100_years_of_Bell_Labs.pdf</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a newly landed immigrant to the US I worked at Bell Labs in Naperville IL for most of the decade of the 1980s and I have a few fun memories mostly of extra-curricular stuff.There was a Unix version of the popular Aliens video game built with curses and played on 9600 baud terminals and when the Pacman video game came out I hacked the Aliens code to play it. Initially I had the monsters represented by 'M' until the player hit the appropriate button that made them run away instead when I changed the character for the monsters to 'W' for wimp. This ran afoul of the affirmative action police as it suggested superiority of 'M'en over 'W'omen so I hastily changed 'W' to 'S'.Another time there was a paper airplane contest where the planes were launched from the 4th floor walkway into the atrium of the Indian Hill West building. There were prizes for the longest distance flight, longest time flight, fastest plane and most beautiful flight. I won the latter with a helicopter-like plane that just spun its way slowly to the floor.The best talk I remember giving was one explaining the game of cricket that took a full hour, and as for work contributions I can only remember coming up with the idea to use the geometric mean to summarize benchmark results.PS one more - my first US code review I spent about 30 mins explaining how my code worked with few if any questions from the other participants. Finally I asked if there were any other questions when someone hesitantly said - "Yes, what is this variable "zed" that you keep talking about?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fun read, and, unlike a lot of material on the Labs, goes back a lot further than 1947.As a software engineer, my favorite book on the topic is "Unix: A History and a Memoir" by Brian Kernighan. It tells many of the same stories that are told elsewhere about the modern history of the Labs, but through the first-person perspective of someone who was there, for whom the characters are not just historical figures, but friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL that Harvey Fletcher (who I knew from his acoustic/audio work, particularly the Fletcher-Munson loudness curve) contributed to the Millikan oildrop experiment. Thanks!Another great resource for understanding what went on at Bell Labs is Richard Hamming's "The Art of Doing Engineering: Learning to Learn"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831043</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;Vanguard explains its decision not to offer Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about the volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. The article emphasizes that the lack of investor protection, potential for fraud, and the speculative nature of Bitcoin contribute to their cautious stance. Vanguard prioritizes long-term, diversified investment strategies and believes that Bitcoin does not align with this philosophy, advocating for traditional investment options that provide a more stable growth potential for clients.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Jackson: In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a role in certain portfolios. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.“Well said, this has been my own thinking on crypto, nice to see it so succinctly summarized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't often get a chance to commend a financial company for making a decision true to values and a long term view of the mission over making a quick buck, but Vanguard in this instance is such a chance.I've been a customer for over 10 years, and am ever more proud of their commitment to promoting long term average investor goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the post says, Vanguard also missed out on Internet funds in the 1990s, and they're OK with that.I am, too. Nobody puts their money in Vanguard to jump on the latest thing (or in the case of Bitcoin, the latest 16-year-old thing). If you really want to speculate, move some of your money elsewhere from Vanguard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832026</guid></item><item><title>34.

If we think they they could strike anywhere we're less likely to focus our efforts.It probably has the long term cost of making us more willing to invest in defence though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopefully Europe got the message and will start arresting and prosecuting the sailors who damage these cables. Europe should impound the vessels as well.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the disparity between the promises of artificial intelligence regarding speed and efficiency and the reality of its performance in practical applications. It highlights how AI can often create more challenges than it resolves, leading to a slower overall process rather than the expected acceleration. The piece emphasizes the need for realistic expectations when integrating AI into workflows and the importance of understanding its limitations to avoid frustration and inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coding is trying to order bytes into doing arbitrary stuff that is useful because of some transient conjunction of factors in the real world.We have developed programming languages because coding in machine language is horrible, and over the decades we've refined them into tools people can use fluently and just directly think in code when they have to make a computer system behave in a certain way.Only someone who has never built anything of significant complexity and utility can think that putting natural language encoding between you and the bytes is a net positive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been my experience with a recent try to guide the LLM to a complete implementation of a small internal tool.
I had in an hour what would have taken me 4 or 5 to write.
But after that, it was an endless loop of the LLM adding logging code to find some bug and failing to fix it, only to add more logging code and ineffectual changes and so on.
The problem is that even after it's lost at sea, it's still answering in a completely confident and self assured tone, so when you decide to take matters in your hands you might be too far gone from sanity and have an unfixable mess in your hands.
I guess I can go back to where it strayed and retake it from there, but by now the experiment seems to be a failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current state of so-called AI does not provide much meaningful assistance in software development beyond basic tasks such as explaining workflows, breaking down thought processes, and performing simple conversions. I believe that generative AI, in its current form, is not true artificial intelligence. Rather, it is a sophisticated prediction engine that lacks genuine reasoning or understanding.True AI should be capable of comprehending problems and devising its own solutions, rather than merely generating statistically likely outputs. Until AI reaches that level of cognitive ability, its applications in the real world remain limited, and much of what we see today is largely hype.Tokenization and embeddings merely help models predict the most probable next token, a process that is executed at scale using vast computational resources. This is not intelligence but large-scale probabilistic prediction. The terminology used in computer science, especially in recent years, can often be misleading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829466</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a former tech CEO who is actively seeking to have records of his arrest removed from the internet. It highlights his efforts to combat the stigma and lasting impact of being associated with a criminal record online, emphasizing the difficulties individuals face in moving on after legal troubles in the digital age. The piece illustrates the challenges related to privacy, reputation management, and the permanence of online information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This specific case is not a great test bed for this, but it's absolutely a big problem that newspapers will publish the full name of someone who was arrested, even if they're subsequently released without a conviction or even without charges. It's a massive and dangerous weapon in the hands of law enforcement (and others) that they can permanently damage someone's reputation—harming their future job prospects and social connections forever—without ever having to prove anything.This isn't a problem that's going to be solved by lawsuits, though, partially because Streisand and partially because in most of the cases where someone's hurt by this the newspapers have no legal obligation to refrain from publishing, so there's no grounds to sue. What we need is to reevaluate the law in light of "the internet never forgets".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a Streisand effect case to me, but I'm not Maury Blackman so I can't say whether or not his arrest for domestic violence in Mission Bay in 2021 will be more well-known now that he's bullying and suing a reporter about it and trying to make it disappear. I can't believe that he might be successful, too, the USA is at some sort of crossroads where if we're not careful the most important freedoms that we have, those we can use to fight un-democratic trash, will vanish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought was if you can be sued for revealing sealed court records?   Apparently in CA it is explicitly illegal:&gt;The lawsuit leans heavily on a California law that makes it illegal to publish an arrest report after it has been sealed by a court. The law has been attacked by First Amendment advocates, who say it violates free speech protections, strengthened in this instance because the information is an issue of public interest — an argument Blackman contests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42833193</guid></item><item><title>38.

    sorted: select orderby Wkts desc orderby Ave asc where Wkts from t

    gap: min allWkts drop 1+range max allWkts

"bestInClass" is probably the most awkward adaptation; I didn't see a tidy way to make a suffix list like ",\".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a similar-ish project a while ago.  I enjoy doing the "Spelling Bee" game in The NY Times Games section.  In the comments someone worried that there weren't enough arrangements to keep the game going very long.  I used an open source dictionary to generate all possible puzzles restricted by some basic heuristics like never using the letter S, having the total number of possible words in some reasonable range, etc.  I found about 23,000 possible puzzles.  My next idea was to use google's n-gram statistics to add some sort of "commonly known" heuristic, but my energy for the project petered out.In any event these languages are great for exploring data in projects like these.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;op, which version of k are you using in the post? for those who'd like to follow along&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832482</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Paul Romer's website discusses the concept of base rate blindness, which refers to the cognitive bias where individuals ignore statistical information (base rates) in favor of specific information. Romer illustrates this phenomenon through various examples, emphasizing its implications in decision-making and policy. He argues that recognizing and addressing base rate blindness is crucial for better understanding statistical reasoning, particularly in fields like economics and public policy, where accurate assessments of risk and probability are essential for effective outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

But this base rate can lead us astry if we apply it to life off the academic reserve.That is a bold assumption, given what has been playing out in academia very publicly and messily over the past few years. While it might be plausible that the base rate for outright fraud in academia is still fairly low, the base rate for all forms of deception is likely extremely high, particularly in highly-cited papers with interesting results.There are just so many ways to tweak your analysis that don't feel like lying, but nudge a p-value the right side of 0.05; so many little issues that might crop up during a study that feel too trivial to mention; so many methodological choices that are perfectly reasonable if you just avoid thinking too hard about what you're doing. All too often, it only takes one little inconsequential-seeming shortcut to get the result you want, but that shortcut makes all the difference in the world.Find me an academic who can defend every word they've published without once squirming or cringing and I'll show you a zebra.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exciting to see an article by Prof. Romer on the front page of HN. Thanks.As the imitation game is a marker of progress, AI is absolutely, by design, trivially, a con.I am questioning this sentence:"instead of zebras versus horses, the types they have to recognize are people who strive to maintain a reputation for honesty versus people who are willing to deceive"The first pair are separate categories, but members of the second pair overlap to a defining degree, whatever the stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The example of seeing a stripy equine in Colorado and having to decide whether it's a horse, ass, or zebra is a good one and highlights what base rate means.However, it even more strongly highlights a problem that comes up in probability: missing assumptions. As in, there's several important missing assumptions in the example.Suppose you're hiking in a country without wild zebras and you see what is clearly a white equine with black stripes.Which is more likely:1. It's a zebra.2. Someone painted stripes on their horse3. You saw patterns of shadows on a white horse4. You accidentally absorbed hallucinogenic fungus through your skin when you wiped you hand on a tree branch...and so on. The longer you think about any unlikely events, the more unlikely possibilities you can come up with.In fact 2. is something I've personally encountered on a hike before, although it wasn't in Colorado.How would you know which of these unlikely events had a higher base rate? It seems unknowable. It depends on whether there are some isolated farms nearby where people keep horses, or whether there was a small zoo in the next town that you didn't know about, whether hallucinogenic fungus grows in this area, and so on.I think it's important to address this in any discussion of probability theory, because hard though the maths is, the complexity of reality is even harder and it's usually omitted or hand waved away when teaching this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42787110</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Render's Series C funding round, where the cloud infrastructure company raised $100 million to expand its services and accelerate growth. It highlights the company's mission to simplify cloud computing for developers and emphasizes the importance of continuing to innovate while providing reliable and accessible infrastructure. The funding is expected to enhance Render's product offerings and improve customer experiences, further solidifying its position in the competitive cloud market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I gotta say, reading this I have no idea what Render actually does or how it's different from AWS or Heroku. They say they've threaded the needle between the two to provide a new way of deploying infra, but what that is…who knows! Naturally a paragraph on AI.At some point companies lose the ability to say, "We are X. It used to be that Y, which had issues of A, B, C. Instead, X does Z, so $USERS can now D, E, F." Where the letters are specific (not empty words like "innovative").As they grow, these companies add additional products, which is one reason I think they lose this. That's okay! Add one or two sentences (max) that say, "Once we solved Z, we kept building to offer L, M, and N. We expanded from serving $USERS to supporting $EXPANDED_USERS who need O and P."It's kind of wild how rare that clarity of communication is. Stripe still does a pretty good job despite the _huge_ range of products, complexity, customer profiles, abstractions, and interfaces.You can definitely tell when companies are either parroting what they've read other splash pages say or are using LLMs to say a bunch of empty platitudes. Good writing is really fking hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a better heroku?My experience is that anything outside of the standard process for deploying apps is actively frowned upon by everyone except startups that need to move extremely quickly to create PoCs. So unless this platform is much much cheaper than the public clouds it seems like a limited market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been on Render for a few months now. Its main value prop is clean UX for infra, which ended up mattering a lot more than I thought. AWS generally induces way more cognitive load than I care to give it (except for S3).Congrats on the raise!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832696</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the application of linear programming to optimize character builds in the video game League of Legends. It outlines the challenges players face in selecting the best combination of items and runes for their champions to maximize performance. By employing linear programming techniques, players can analyze various build options quantitatively, leading to more effective strategies and improved gameplay. The write-up emphasizes the importance of mathematical modeling in gaming and provides insights into how these methods can enhance decision-making for players.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love it when people apply operations research technologies to silly things like video games.One thing I'm missing in this article is a discussion of how useful the ILP techniques really were compared to dumber heuristics. Take the first optimal build as an example:- We know we will need some items that give us a large boost to our stats thanks to the six-item limit.- Nashor's tooth seems like an "obvious" choice for the above, given that it supplies 130 units of desirable stats at only 100 gold per unit.- Once we have that, the Amplifying Tome is really only there to fill out the remaining units of one of the stats.I guess what I'm saying is the optimal item selection has surprisingly few interactions. That seems like a solution we could get close to with far simpler methods!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off-topic: this is the third blog I come accross in the last month that does not use capital letters at the beginning of sentences. Am I out of the loop? Why is that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unable to read the article.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't a direct answer to your question, but be very careful with asking for HAR files. They're super convenient, but if your tech support doesn't understand that HAR files are the worst kind of PII you can get in big trouble.I've seen HAR files containing Google account session tokens attached in plain text to Jira tickets. If you end up leaking those tokens your customers will not be amused.See the Okta breach:https://www.rezonate.io/blog/har-files-attack-okta-customers...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What was the body of the HTTP 400? You should log that. Maybe there's a refresh token grace period depending on implementation.I'd sooner be testing in a lab environment recording a pcap file on both sides to try to get the client's TLS session to break before I'd want a client's confidential credential flow sent to me. I don't like to bother people. I've always hated refresh tokens, at least OAuth's design of them. Is sending a client's decrypted MITM logs around really safer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How intermittent of an issue is it? I don't think collecting client side HAR files from real customers is the way to go, even if they're willing. What happens when the next weird error shows up? More HAR files?Echoing some other suggestions, but to a different extent, increase logging in the problem areas both client-side and server-side. It might be directly related to the token refresh since it only happens there, so a great place to start is within that functionality. Log the entire connection's info to both services (front and back logging) and if users are manually submitting tickets you should be able to track them down by userID / IP in the logs.Also extend the fuzzing capabilities w/ your tests through browser (potentially could be headless, depending on the issue) automation that authenticates and uses the app "normally". Keep it on repeat using the app and when token refresh time comes see if the error pops up. Throw some extra variables in their, ensure its off the corporate network or routed through DCs farther away to see if it's a latency issue somewhere else. You could log the HAR file for this.Multiple versions of tests might need to be run in parallel with different modifiers, such as one being allowed to directly communicate w/ the origin, vs. another going through the CDN like a standard customer would.This is also an edge-case, but I've seen it popup sometimes; ensure that there aren't any other required variables that are missing during the refresh process. Sometimes specific functionality in some apps is tied to a custom header, and sometimes the value isn't updated to what the app expects. Things like that which could throw the process of from another angle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42817554</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;Polyhedral.info is a resource dedicated to the exploration and study of polyhedra, which are three-dimensional geometric shapes with flat polygonal faces. The website features a variety of content including detailed descriptions of different types of polyhedra, their mathematical properties, and visual representations. It aims to provide educational material and stimulate interest in geometry, making it accessible to both enthusiasts and students. The site may also include tools for visualizing polyhedra and their relationships, enhancing the understanding of complex geometric concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806518"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, cool. This came up in a conversation a work somewhat recently, which is where I first heard the term. The basic idea is slick but straightforward:Say you have a multidimensional array, A[i][j] for concreteness. A loop over the array will typically look like nested loops, e.g. assuming we start with a properly initialized array, something like    for(i=0; i&lt;I; i++) {
        for(j=i; j&lt;2*i; j++) {
            A[i+1][j+2]+=A[i][j];
        }
    }

Since A[i+1][j+1] has a data dependency on both i and j indicies, the loop has to be executed sequentially over both i and j. However, drawing out the data flow shows how a change of perspective can make the inner loop completely vectorizable. First, let's draw the traversed indices on a grid like    . . . . . o o o o o
    . . . . o o o o o .
    . . . . o o o o . .
    . . . o o o o . . .
    . . . o o o . . . .
    . . o o o . . . . .
    . . o o . . . . . .
    . o o . . . . . . .
    . o . . . . . . . .
    o . . . . . . . . .

Notice that we get a polygon in this 2D case. Drawing with more indices and a higher-dimensional pen will give you polyhedron, whence the name! Now connect marked indices that have a data dependency; zooming into the bottom-left corner, it looks something like the below in our example:    .   . / o / o
         / / /
    .   o / o   .
       / /
    . / o   .   .
     /
    o   .   .   .

The key insight here is that we have a bunch of parallel lines, meaning we should be able to start our calculation at all the bottom left points and flow up-and-right (at slope 2!) along each line in parallel. Doing this in code means we want all those lines to be parallel with grid lines as much as possible, reducing the problem to a simple linear transformation of the polygon!In particular, the indices correspond to the grid points and the polygon our data. We want data to be flowing perpendicular to an index in order to parallelize said axis, so crunching out the details of a solution for our example gives    for(i=0; i&lt;I; i++) {
        for(j=i; j&lt;2*(i-I); i++, j+=2) {
            A[i+1][j]+=A[i][j];
        }
    }

Notice that array in the inner loop no longer data between j indices any more! That lets us run the entire thing in parallel.That's the basic idea anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most likely this API is used then https://libisl.sourceforge.io/user.html#Polyhedral-Compilati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone that frequently searches for code and algorithms related to actual polyhedra, I find this choice of terminology rather irritating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806518</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome! The first Pebble absolutely fascinated me by having a hackable, C-running watch on my wrist.I vividly remember spending days fine tuning the heuristics of a simple step detection algorithm in the first watchface where I thought “seeing your daily step count next to time sure is awesome”. And later, tens of thousands of people thought so as well - this was one of the signs what the health-tracking wrist device is about to become.It was incredible that even the first model allowed you to run a 30 samples per second accelerometer sampling and classifying the movement, 24/7, and still lasted days. No other watch offers a similar level of hackability.And as the time progressed, Pebble became the first platform to get Weathergraph - my graphical weather watchface.Weathergraph was then ported to Garmin (as Pebble shut down), and then to Apple Watch widget (as it became a capable platform with the introduction of standalone watch-apps in watchOS 6), and then to iOS app &amp; widget, where it now lets me live a life of indie developer, after a serie of corporate design/PM/dev jobs.Thank you for that, Eric &amp; Pebble team.I still keep the developer edition Pebble with my name printed on the back (great touch!) in my shelf and heart, and will always remember Jon Barlow, one of the best and most helpful developer advocates I ever encountered.And kudos to the whole dev team. The watch and companion app was rock stable, always staying connected, the calendar always being in sync, watch apps installed quickly and reliably - the things that 10x larger companies struggled with for years were nailed here almost from day one.Godspeed!PS: What a mishap to shut the company down shortly after a release of Pebble 2. It nailed the experience of a lightweight watch, with the most contrasty BW reflective screen I have seen, and buttery smooth animations (while Garmin still renders menus in like 8-10 fps on their MIP screens 10 years later). So small and lightweight, I’d love everyone to try it on, and compare with 2024 smartwatches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very interesting to me. 
There are a couple of features that are especially important to me.- Good accuracy sleep tracking- GPS ( I know this uses up a lot of battery but could be off by default)- Self-hostable servers. (I'm a very privacy conscious person, and also I don't want to be bound to an ecosystem that might disappear one day)I'm gonna keep an eye on this project. It really looks very interesting. 
I hope it gets far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed my mouth had been hanging agape for a while while reading this. This is huge news. I feel like Pebble is the smartwatch that got it right the first time. So many smartwatches try to replace the phone instead of being an extension of the phone. Pebble seemed to better understand what is important than most smartwatches by being the extension of the phone, a focus on battery life and always on displays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845091</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack is an open-source project that enables users to locate Apple devices using Bluetooth signals. The project leverages Apple's Find My network and aims to help people track their lost devices while also providing a framework for developing custom tracking applications. It allows users to create a DIY tracking system that can detect Apple's broadcast signals and build a local system to find devices without relying solely on Apple's proprietary system. The project emphasizes privacy and security, ensuring that the tracking process remains decentralized and user-controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was a good option for non Apple users. From what I've heard Google made their version pretty bad, as expected. They rate limit how often you can search for your own tags, they won't show the location until a tag has been seen by multiple phones, there's poor coverage. One test I saw showed that Samsung's network was better, which makes no sense since Samsung phones should be a subset of all Android phones in Google's network, but that's Google products for you. Sounds good in theory but poorly executed, even years after Apple showed how to do it.https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-netwo...https://9to5google.com/2024/08/01/find-my-device-stress-test...https://9to5google.com/2024/08/03/google-android-find-my-dev...https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-googl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone point me to something I saw earlier? Apple alerts users to "tags that might be following you". Someone made an implementation that used a KDF to rotate the mac address or private key or something, but it was predictable in a way you could track each derivation of the of the mac/private key.There is a really obnoxious petty theft problem where I live, and the time it takes to constantly get my windows fixed or forced entry crap removed is worth a significant amount of my personal time. I have zero desire to confront anyone, but I'd like to be able to create a track for a PI or Law enforcement some day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking through the code, it looks like this uses your personal Apple Mail entitlements to pull the locations that get collected by devices on the FindMy network:https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/8d214aa5eb68...I wonder if this were also possible by making an Apple developer account.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835772</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the profound emotional and psychological impact of being laid off from a job, emphasizing how such an experience can alter a person's identity and outlook on their career. It explores themes of self-worth, vulnerability, and resilience, highlighting the importance of navigating the aftermath of a layoff and finding ways to rebuild one's professional life. The author reflects on personal experiences and offers insights on coping strategies and the potential for growth following such a challenging setback.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been in high tech for 30 years, and I've been laid off many times, most often from failed start ups.  I _strongly_ disagree with a fully cynical response of working only to contract, leveraging job offers for raises, etc.There are a few reasons for this, but the most concrete is that your behavior in this job has an impact on getting the next one.  The author is correct that exemplary performance will not save you from being laid off, but when layoffs come your next job often comes from contacts that you built up from the current job, or jobs before.  If people know you are a standout contributor then you will be hired quickly into desirable roles.  If people think you are a hired gun who only does the bare minimum that next role will be harder to find.On top of that, carrying around bitterness and cynicism is just bad for you.  Pride in good work and pleasure in having an impact on customers and coworkers is good for you.  Sometimes that means making dumb business decisions like sacrificing an evening to a company that doesn't care, but IMO that sort of thing is worth it now and then.To be sure, don't give your heart away to a company (I did that exactly once, never again) because a company will never love you back.  But your co-workers will.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that bothers me most about layoffs due to “financial difficulties” is when you observe management wasting absurd amounts of money on something in one year, then announcing the following year that they have to make cuts to baseline, “low level” employees that don’t cost much at all.This kind of managerial behavior seriously kills employee motivation, because it both communicates that 1) no one has job security and 2) that management is apparently incapable of managing money responsibly.“Sorry, we spent $200k on consultants and conferences that accomplished nothing, so now we have to cut an employee making $40k” really erodes morale in ways that merely firing people doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After being laid off more than once, I think I'd adjust the advice a little:- You're only obliged to work your contract hours. If you do more then make sure that you, personally, are getting something out of it, whether that's "I look good to my boss" or "I take job satisfaction from this" or just "I get to play with Kotlin". Consider just not working overtime.- Take initiative, but do so sustainably. Instead of trying to look good for promo, or alternately doing the bare minimum and just scraping by, take on impactful work at a pace that won't burn you out and then leave if it isn't rewarded.- Keep an ear to the ground. Now you've got a job, you don't need another one, but this is a business relationship just like renting a house or paying for utilities. Be aware of the job market, and consider interviewing for roles that seriously interest you. Don't go crazy and waste the time of every company in your city lest it come back to bite you, but do interview for roles you might actually take.The last two points are fine, however.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42838700</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I'd love to hear opinions on from someone with more free time to read these papers from DeepSeek is: am I right to feel like they're... publishing all their secret sauce? The paper for R1 (1) seems to be pretty clear how they got such good results with so little horsepower (see: 'Group Relative Policy Optimization'). Is it not likely that Facebook, OpenAI, etc will just read these papers and implement the tricks? Am I missing something?1. https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So much for "but deepseek doesn't do multi-modal..." as a defence of the alleged moats of western AI companies.How ever many modalities do end up being incorporated however, does not change the horizon of this technology which has progressed only by increasing data volume and variety -- widening the solution class (per problem), rather than the problem class itself.There is still no mechanism in GenAI that enforces deductive constraints (and compositionality), ie., situations where when one output (, input) is obtained the search space for future outputs is necessarily constrained (and where such constraints compose). Yet all the sales pitches about the future of AI require not merely encoding reliable logical relationships of this kind, but causal and intentional ones: ones where hypothetical necessary relationships can be imposed and then suspended; ones where such hypotheticals are given a ordering based on preference/desires; ones where the actions available to the machine, in conjunction with the state of its environment, lead to such hypothetical evaluations.An "AI Agent" replacing an employee requires intentional behaviour: the AI must act according to business goals, act reliably using causal knowledge of the environment, reason deductively over such knowledge, and formulate provisional beliefs probabilistically. However there has been no progress on these fronts.I am still unclear on what the sales pitch is supposed to be for stochastic AI, as far as big business goes or the kinds of mass investment we see. I buy a 70s-style pitch for the word processor ("edit without scissors and glue"), but not a 60s-style pitch for the elimination of any particular job.The spend on the field at the moment seems predicated on "better generated images" and "better generated text" somehow leading to "an agent which reasons from goals to actions, simulates hypothetical consequences, acts according to causal and environmental constraints.. " and so on. With relatively weak assumptions one can show the latter class of problem is not in the former, and no amount of data solving the former counts as a solution to the latter.The vast majority of our work is already automated to the point where most non-manual workers are paid for the formulation of problems (with people), social alignment in their solutions, ownership of decision-making / risk, action under risk, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that I regret is that these Chinese models are still heavily censored. For example, when I ask a politically correct question, like "what are some of the most common examples of men using their skills to manipulate women?" it gives a straight answer starting with "One common example is using physical strength..." and so on. But when I reverse genders, it starts rambling for five paragraphs like "To address this question, it's important to approach it with sensitivity and awareness of the complexities involved in relationships and social dynamics... Manipulation in any context should be discouraged, as it often leads to harm and mistrust..." without actually saying anything concrete. Even the "uncensored" models stumble on this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42843131</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People passing cynical comments at Google need to understand that at a big co like Google, something like this doesn't 'just happen'. It probably happened because some passionate L6/L7 engineer wanted to do it and pushed through the bureaucracy to get approvals for it, probably largely on their own time (by which I mean that this was at best a side-project for them and at worst a distraction that was losing them favor with their bosses). At every point in the process, they probably had to justify what they were doing to their leads, to lawyers, to privacy reviewers, who had no real stake in it and so had nothing to lose by saying No. They almost certainly won't receive any career progress out of this and would risk a setback if something slips through the cracks (such as some unredacted proprietary information).They did it because they felt it was the right thing to do. Good things happen through the actions of individuals like this. We should acknowledge and celebrate it when they do, anti-big-tech cynicism can wait.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you, Google. You didn't have to, but you did. We are all are extraordinarily grateful.I wrote a blog post about our plans to bring Pebble back, sustainably. https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-backWe got our original start on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3827868), it's a pleasure to be back.If you're interested in getting a new Pebble, check out https://rePebble.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't say it often, but this is very nice of Google and they really didn't have to.Credit where it's due&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845070</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "The Old Family Photos Project," which highlights the importance of creating family photographs that hold sentimental value. It shares insights on how to capture moments that resonate with family members, encouraging photographers to focus on genuine interactions and meaningful connections rather than posed images. The piece emphasizes storytelling through photography, aiming to create lasting memories that people will cherish and want to preserve for future generations. It encourages a shift in perspective regarding family photos, advocating for authenticity and emotional resonance in capturing family life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835282"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are two categories of family photos:1) Photos you look at when the subjects are still alive2) Photos that you remember people by and cherish people for    1 = are all the typical family group pics, lots of posing

    2 = the photos where the subjects may not even know that they are being photographed, while doing the things they are cherished for by others. Sometimes they might not even like the presented actvities, but everyone else around them appreciates it .

   - Photos of people repairing their family's gadgets
   - Photos of people doing mundane tasks, ironing their clothes, cooking dinner for everyone, being exhausted, reading to others...

    - This is what prevails while people are still alive who remember you. What you will be remembered by. Mostly what you did for other people and how people observed you.

Take photos of your parents and loved relatives during daily life and their tasks. You will be far more moved and inspired by these pics, than by typical family group photos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I lost all of my photos (along with everything else) when growing up, so taking pictures and videos was important to me as I became an adult.I'm 59 now. In the 1990s I started taking VHS videos of family events. Sometimes I would walk around "interviewing", sometimes I would walk around and try to normally talk to people while holding that huge recorder. (That didn't work). I even set it up on a tripod and just let the recorder run while my parents and others visited.This past year I've ripped a couple of dozen DVDs out of all of those tapes. In the past two weeks I've then ffmpeg'ed them to mp4s and loaded on an SD drive and put in a e-picture frame.Now we have 30-40 hours of "family memory TV" playing constantly in our living room. It is one of the most amazing things I've done with technology. I can't describe the feeling of looking back 30+ years to see folks who are long gone -- or now adults with their own kids!God I'm glad I didn't record all of this on a cell phone or use social media. It would have been impossible to have the patience and time to scale all of those walled gardens for this project.Best videos? The "family interview show", where I ask questions and everybody performs some kind of art. Wish I'd done one of those every year. Second best? Just setting the cam up and letting it run. Third place are videos of family members doing things that'll never happen again, like watching a sonogram of a new baby on the way.Worst videos? As I know (and knew at the time!), a bunch of videos and pictures of things we were looking at that were interesting to us at the time but stuff you could find online in a couple of seconds. Unless it has audio commentary, it was a pointless exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a related problem, which I hit while scanning family archives going back slightly more than 100 years. There is no good photo archival software.If you now rushed to click "reply" to say that yes, of course there is, right here, hold your horses. You probably do not understand the problem.Good photo archival software would let me keep my photos in formats that will be readable 25 years from now. It must not rely on any company being in business or offering any service.It must support storing the same picture in multiple formats. It must support assigning dates to pictures that are not the same as the file date nor the EXIF date. It must support assigning imprecise dates (just a year, or ideally an interval).It must support storing multiple files as part of the same "image", and I do not mean multiple versions/formats of an image here. Examples: front and back of a scanned paper photo, or 24 scans of a large format picture that are then merged together into a resulting stitched image.All that information must be preserved in ways that will let me recover it even without any software (e.g. files in the filesystem).I used many solutions over the years, and got royally screwed by most, the most recent one being Apple shutting down Aperture (which did most of these things pretty well). I am now close to writing my own software.EDIT: to all those who respond with "just store it as files" — yes, of course they should be stored as files. But that's not an answer. You do want searchability, nice visual access, and other niceties on top of the basic plumbing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835282</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Marginalia is a search engine designed specifically for finding annotated texts, marginalia, and notes in a variety of books and documents. It aims to enhance the process of exploring literary works by allowing users to discover insights, interpretations, and commentary left by previous readers. The platform provides access to a wealth of literary annotations, promoting a deeper understanding of texts through the lens of collective readership and scholarly discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

I think this is already integrated into the website but there used to only be this testing page:
https://explore2.marginalia.nu/In any case I have a lot of respect for the creator. Marginalia has seen a lot of growth and it's been interesting reading the blogposts.[2][1]: https://www.marginalia.nu/log/26-personalized-pagerank/

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the author's experience attempting to reduce the size of all npm packages by 5% using a custom script. The author explores the technical challenges faced during this process, including complexities related to package dependencies and compatibility issues. Despite the effort and initial excitement, the attempt ultimately did not yield the desired results, highlighting the difficulties of optimizing package sizes in the diverse JavaScript ecosystem. The author reflects on the lessons learned and the broader implications for package management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final pro/cons list: https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1200480148I don't find the cons all that compelling to be honest, or at least I think they warrant further discussion to see if there are workarounds (e.g. a choice of compression scheme for a library like typescript, if they would prefer faster publishes).It would have been interesting to see what eventually played out if the author hadn't closed the RFC themselves. It could have been the sort of thing that eventually happens after 2 years, but then quietly makes everybody's lives better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last I checked npm packages were full of garbage including non-source code. There's no reason for node_modules to be as big as it usually is, text compresses extremely well. It's just general sloppiness endemic to the JavaScript ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Props to anyone who tries to make the world a better place.Its not always obvious who has the most important use cases. In the case of NPM they are prioritizing the user experience of module authors. I totally see how this change would be great for module consumers, yet create potentially massive inconvenience for module authors.Interesting write-up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42840548</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of Heaviside transmission lines, which are used to model the behavior of ideal transmission lines under various conditions. It discusses the mathematical foundations, including the equations governing wave propagation, voltage, and current along the lines. The text emphasizes the significance of parameters like resistance, inductance, capacitance, and conductance in determining the transmission line's characteristics. Additionally, it addresses the analysis of wave reflections and the effects of different terminations on signal integrity. Overall, the document serves as a technical guide for understanding the behavior and applications of Heaviside transmission lines in electrical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a fascinating story about ego in science buried here.William Henry Preece was Engineer-In-Chief at the British Post Office in the late 19th Century (basically heading their telegraphy efforts) and controversially stuck to Thomson's model, or the "KR Law" as it was called back then, relying on poor quality experimental results to direct the organization.Oliver Heaviside publicly criticized Preece, who in turn blocked publication of Heaviside's writing to preserve his own reputation (according to Wikipedia). When Preece retired in 1899 and received a knighthood, Heaviside wrote in the preface of Volume II of "Electromagnetic Theory":"It is to be hoped and expected that the late important removals in the British Telegraph Department will lead to much improvement in the quality of official science."Writing by hand on his own copy, Heaviside suggested that the preface (and thus the book's publication) were "held back" so as to "allow W H Preece to make sure of his knighthood".https://outsideecho.com/DGT-BIO_files/PDFs/DGT13.pdfSo! On the one hand, we have an esteemed engineer who ran the country's telegraphs and refused to admit he made a mistake, became a knight and faded somewhat from history; on the other hand, we have a self-taught physicist who made massive contributions to our understanding and analysis of electromagnetism, lived in "relative poverty" for fifty years while doing so, didn't shy away from calling out bad science, and he gets the analogue of heaven named after him in the musical "CATS".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent post!Controlled impedance took me a long time to wrap my head around when starting PCB design, the moment when it finally clicked was watching this excellent AlphaPhoenix video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXv49dDQJw&amp; asking and practically demonstrating the simple question:When you flip on a switch, to turn on anything, send data, morse something etc, how does the circuit know how much current the load at the other end needs?Spoiler: Given that information can't travel faster than light, the simple answer is: it doesn't. So it just guesses and adjusts, which you don't want as it gives you exactly the ringing etc Heaviside identified. The video is a nice complement, as it perfectly visualizes the issues at play.It's a pretty wild bit of understanding to have, even in simple situations like flipping on a light switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For years and years I thought the "heavy side" function was 1 on one side of the origin and 0 on the other. I also thought the "pointing" vector pointed in the direction the wave was travelling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42840352</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the SiFive website [1]&gt; The Performance P550 scales up to four-core complex configurations while delivering 30% higher performance in less than half the area of a comparable Arm® Cortex®-A75.Dylan Patel wasn't impressed by these comparisons with A75 [2]&gt; @SiFive is claiming half the area and higher perf/GHz, but they are using 7nm and 100ns memory latency. Choosing to compare to the 10nm A75 on S845, notorious for its high latency at over 200ns. Purposely ignoring iso-node or other A75 comparisons.And this analysis seems to be borne out in this Chips and Cheese post.&gt; As a step along that journey, P550 feels more comparable to one of Arm’s early out-of-order designs like Cortex A57. By the time A75 came out, Arm already accumulated substantial experience in designing out-of-order CPUs. Therefore, A75 is a well polished and well rounded core, aside from obvious sacrifices required for its low power and thermal budgets. P550 by comparison is rough around the edges.So what to make of SiFive's claims? It seems quite an important claim / comparison.[1] https://www.sifive.com/cores/performance-p550[2] https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1415395415000817664&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Likely, P550 doesn’t have another BTB level. If a branch misses the 32 entry BTB, the core simply calculates the branch’s destination address when it arrives at the frontendThat seems unwise. Might work well enough for direct branches, but it's going to preform very badly on indirect branches. I would love to see some tests for indirect branch performance (static and dynamic) in your suite.&gt; When return stack capacity is exceeded, P550 sees a sharp spike in latency. That contrasts with A75’s more gentle increase in latency.That might be a direct consequence of the P550's limited BTB. Even when the return stack overflows, the A75 can probably still predict the return as if it was an indirect branch, utilising its massive 3072 entry L1 BTB.Actually, are you sure the P550 even has a return stack? 16 correctly predicted call/ret pairs just so happens to be what you would get from a 32 entry BTB predicting 16 calls then 16 returns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest Technical Reference Manual for the Eswin EIC7700X is here.https://github.com/eswincomputing/EIC7700X-SoC-Technical-Ref...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42839501</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really happy to see OpenSCAD stuff here in HN. Of course it has some downsides (not being able to measure an object is the main one...), but it is an underrated tool.I'm using it as my main 3D modeling tool for three years, and I even gave I course about it last year. No regrets, and I never felt that I needed to learn Fusion or similar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This came up at pretty much the perfect time for me to try out.I started learning OpenSCAD over the weekend to try out an idea to 3d print a 70" dome to make my own Star Wars Battlepod after seeing that video on making the replica Space War cabinet.One guy got an acrylic forming shop to make him one about 10 years ago for $700, but I was calculating in how much it would cost to 3d print and stich a dome screen together. My test sample that I started used a sort of ribbed dome that I was trying to figure out how to split the file and bolt it together - https://www.reddit.com/r/openscad/comments/1i922ed/trying_to...I started playing around with thickness because at 1/2 inch, it was looking like about $200 in filament. But if I can reduce the thickness because of having the jigsaw edging to make it easier to align, it might get cheaper.Currently tried running this in Windows and it isn't happy. I'll make a Linux VM and give it a go again.&gt;&gt;WARNING: Too many unnamed arguments supplied in file in.scad, line 6

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know if this is a good place for feature requests, but the only thing keeping me from switching to this at at the moment is download settings per podcast.For example, some podcasts I don't want to miss an episode and I want them all downloaded. Other podcasts I only check in on occasionally and would only want the latest episode to be kept on device.I subscribe to a lot of podcast and downloading and keeping every episode is going to eat up a lot of storage.Besides that, love the simplicity of it. Well done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Boost voices" is a cool feature a lot of apps have, but what is really needed is a "compress voices" feature. So many podcasters speak loudly 75% of the time, but then trail off randomly or almost whisper. Then you turn it up and they're projecting loudly again and blow your ears out. It's especially annoying in the car trying to compete with road noise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those of unfamiliar with Racket, could you go over what it takes to run a Racket app on iOS?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42838875</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;With some filtering on the output to knock down harmonics and aliasing noise, and as long as the power output is low enough, this could actually be legal in the US. IANAL, etc, but this is my understanding:It's actually ridiculously tricky to measure transmitter power output in the terms that the FCC regs are written in, but the rule of thumb is that, given the receiver sensitivity of a typical radio, if you lose the signal when you're more than 200 feet from the transmitter, you're probably in the clear.This means a perfectly legal power level would be more than adequate to cover your house, office, hackerspace, or whatever.https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/low-power-radio-general-info...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Otherwise known as frequency swifting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember going to the drive-in movie theater in the 80's.  You had to tune your car radio to a specific frequency to hear the movie audio.  If this device had existed back then, you wouldn't have needed to tune your car radio at all.  I doubt the neighbors would have liked that though.  As an aside, I remember being jealous of the neighbors because they got to watch all these movies for essentially free.  The irony is that today, we're bombarded by content, it's become essentially free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42843623</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;A recent tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas has been identified as the largest in recorded history in the United States. The outbreak has been linked to the state’s specific social and health demographics, leading to increased public health efforts to address the situation. State officials are intensifying testing and treatment protocols to control the spread and inform the community about the symptoms and prevention of tuberculosis. The situation highlights ongoing public health challenges and the need for effective intervention strategies in managing infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being from the US, I find it odd that the article didn't mention anything about vaccination.  Until 2005, pretty much everyone in the UK received the BCG vaccine.  After that the TB rate fell too low to merit routine vaccination, but even today it's still given routinely in a few areas where the rate merits it, or if there's elevated risk of exposure via family from abroad, etc.  Has vaccination in general become such a divisive topic in the US that articles about diseases for which we used to routinely vaccinate don't even mention that a vaccine is available and greatly reduces the risk of the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;John Green, author of "The Fault in Our Stars", "Turtles All the Way Down", "The Anthropocene Reviewed", and other fine books is releasing a book called "Everything is Tuberculosis." If you are interested in the topic or just like to read well-written prose, I recommend joining me in pre-ordering it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Largest in recorded history is a bit of hyperbole. In the 1800s something like 80% of all Americans had the TB bacillus and of those that came down with TB a huge percentage died.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835183</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of bilinear downsampling and upsampling in pixel grids, particularly focusing on the significance of half-pixel offsets. It explores how these offsets affect the quality of image transformations and how they can lead to smoother results in image processing. The author presents visual examples to illustrate these points and provides insights into the mathematical underpinnings of bilinear interpolation methods. Overall, the piece serves as both an educational resource for those interested in image processing techniques and a technical guide for implementing effective upsampling and downsampling strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great article. That half pixel offset is crucial for understanding proper rasterization of detailed 3D meshes. No seams, no holes, no overlaps on shared triangle edges rely on exactly where the pixel centers are. This carries over to image processing and sampling. There are a few of us that lose sleep over these tiny details -- I am happy when I see kindred spirits with the same attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a similar note, yesterday I stumbled across a 4-days old video related to dithering which is really worth watching.

It's basically an automatic tool that bookmarks commands based on usage. I think the best bookmark systems are ones which simply track your entire history and suggest relevant pages based on it.

I remember him as such when I was young.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had one member of the troup that did the real life Great Escape visit our school.He handed out schematics of how they tunneled, their day-to-day logistics, communication with the outside, etc.It was a really fun talk, but it ended on a somber note where those who did not escape were later punished/executed in revenge for the escape taking place.In this context, someone asked him, "was it worth it?" and all I remember about his answer was him gripping his handout and giving a monosyllable reply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small note, the airdrop was to Saint-Omer, a Luftwaffe airbase in France not a castle.

Things like btop++ that respond to mouse clicks and smoothly reflow when the terminal window is resized etc...Shout-out to Charmbracelet's stuff such as Glow (https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) and Gum (https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for rendering markdown nicely in the terminal and for using TUI in your shell scripts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have built a beautiful TUI, hats off. Having that said, however, if feels like a missed opportunity for  this project to use an SQLAlchemy-based database backend over the more simplistic and widely supported ledger [1] format. While I understand that the your tool might not want to leverage the full complexity of a double-entry accounting system, as a friend of plain text accounting [2] I would have preferred a format that I can alter with existing tools, in order to be able to integrate _Bagels_ into an existing workflow.Nevertheless, the TUI looks very clean and shows nicely how powerful the Textual application framework is.[1] https://ledger-cli.org
[2] https://plaintextaccounting.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos, great execution on the project and on the code too.Question: Is there a good equivalent of the Dewey Decimal system for household and/or business expenses?  I like your two level breakdown in default_categories.yaml and the must/need/want system and I’m wondering what prior art you used to put that together?I see about 800 payees for my own transactions over the past two years and while the big ticket items are easy enough to spot — my favourite grocery store, my landlord, etc. — having a taxonomy that can encompass the long tail of spending would give me confidence that I have 100% understanding of my finances.Edit: Here’s one from some UN statisticians.  Turn to page 40 of the PDF (p27 in print) for the basic structure overview:https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/Download/In...The overview felt quite ergonomic but rebalancing the overview to maintain constant branching might be useful.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw Felienne Hermans give a talk on Hedy at Splash! but that wasn't recorded sadly, but here is a presentation too a much larger audience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4eSjA6btE8 that I hope covers the same material.It is a wonderfully amazing project. I don't know if the video goes into it yet, but when you see how truly egalitarian the project is, you are both proud and ashamed of humanity. Proud that Felienne made this project and all the lives she is improving, but ashmed that it took us this long. Lets make up for it by making everything we design with the same affordances.  Lets democratize access to the future.You might recognize Felienne from her research on Spreadsheets which I feel was a thing here around 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKru5d4GPk It feels like that was the start of resurgence in respect for Spreadsheets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hedy is great for learning programming to kids.I tried this a while ago with my scout group, I expected them to take a while per lesson, but they flew through the lessons in no time, drawing all sorts of patterns and making little games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up French. Never had any issue remembering English keywords. It's not like "for" really flows naturally as an indication of a looping construct.Edit: I sounded overall negative about this, but I didn't meant to be. I really like the tutorial, and the `ask` and `echo` constructs. I will show it to my son.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42837636</guid></item><item><title>22.

I'm not a user of any Autodesk products, but doesn't this say that they're still going to do the core thing that people were upset about? Remove posts that would help users with “““discontinued””” perpetually-licensed software to push those people to subscribe to the newer equivalent?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent and related:Autodesk deletes old forum posts suddenly - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42571995 - Jan 2025 (170 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just don’t understand why they shut them down in the first place.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Alpha Myth: How Captive Wolves Misrepresent the Wild" by Anthony David Adams explores the misconception of wolf pack hierarchies, particularly the idea that wolf packs are led by an "alpha" figure. It discusses the origins of this myth stemming from captive studies, emphasizing that such hierarchical structures are not reflective of wolves in their natural habitats. The piece highlights how this misunderstanding has influenced our perceptions of wolf behavior and conservation efforts, urging a shift towards a more accurate understanding of social dynamics among wild wolves.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often like to sum it up as: "Thinking gangs observed in prison represent human households."This goes along with an imagined mockumentary, narrated by a David Attenborough figure, ex: "In the living room, a confrontation is brewing. The Big Boss has informed the bottom-tier Henchmen Homies that it is time for lights-out, but they are not ready to leave the television and they resent the privileges of the older Made Man, who is permitted to remain. This is a problem for the Big Boss, since directly punishing them might undermine his claim to control the group as a whole. Fortunately for him, his Enforcer is arriving from the kitchen, attracted by the noise..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might not be the best possible version of myself but I am at least a release candidate, and therefore have transceded the concepts of „alpha male“ and „beta male“.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact the wolf alpha male theory was wrong doesn't imply we don't have alpha dominance for men.Do we use alpha male gorillas to explain the concept?(Edit) Or Chimpanzees: https://news.janegoodall.org/2018/07/10/top-bottom-chimpanze...  The highest-ranking chimpanzee in a group is the alpha-male. These males climb their way to the top of the chimpanzee hierarchy, and the ways they choose to do so can differ with the personality of the individual leader. Take two of the alpha males observed in Gombe, Frodo and Freud, for instance. Though they were brothers, each chimp had a very different leadership style. While Freud maintained control through fostering strong alliances and grooming those he wanted to keep under his command, Frodo relied heavily on aggression and brute strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42844619</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to enhance SQLite performance and functionality by integrating custom Ruby functions. It outlines the steps to set up a Ruby function to be called within SQL queries, highlights the benefits of this approach in terms of extending SQLite's capabilities, and provides examples of practical use cases. The author emphasizes the advantages of combining Ruby's expressive power with SQLite's lightweight database system to improve data processing and manipulation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking full advantage of SQLite's extensibility is a center piece of my Go driver.It started due to having to reimplement the OS layer in Go because of tech constraints, but it means you _can_ implement VFSes, UDFs (scalar, aggregates and windows), and virtual tables in Go, with reasonable performance and nice APIs.I also made a point of dogfooding this as much as possible, with a bunch of extensions and a few custom VFSes that use the same APIs available to clients of the library.https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/exthttps://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/vfs#custom-v...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this the same thing as create_function for python?https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Conne...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can hypothetically write your entire product in SQL with appropriate bindings to SQLite. For me, SQL with CTEs is a very compelling way to model tricky business logic. Building a SQL-based rules engine is trivial if your host language has a good SQLite library.This thing starts to grow legs once you realize you can recursively get into the rabbit hole by binding something like an Execute_Sql UDF - You can store the actual scripts within the same schema they operate on. Treating your code as data means you can do things like transactional updates of business logic while the system is serving live requests. You also get simple reflection &amp; search over the business logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42812029</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate that "tools" that are used to build the final version of a module/cli/service are explicitly managed through go.mod.I really dislike that now I'm going to have two problems, managing other tools installed through a makefile, e.g. lint, and managing tools "installed" through go.mod, e.g. mocks generators, stringify, etc.I feel like this is not a net negative on the ecosystem again. Each release Golang team adds thing to manage and makes it harder to interact with other codebases. In this case, each company will have to decide if they want to use "go tool" and when to use it. Each time I clone an open source repo I'm going to have to check how they manage their tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's a bad addition since it pushes people towards a worse solution to a common problem.Using "go tool" forces you to have a bunch of dependencies in your go.mod that can conflict with your software's real dependency requirements, when there's zero reason those matter. You shouldn't have to care if one of your developer tools depends on a different version of a library than you.It makes it so the tools themselves also are being run with a version of software they weren't tested with.If, for example, you used "shell.nix" or a dockerfile with the tool built from source, the tool's dependencies would match it's go.mod.Now they have to merge with your go.mod...And then, of course, you _still_ need something like shell.nix or a flox environment (https://flox.dev/) since you need to control the version of go, control the version of non-go tools like "protoc", and so you already have a better solution to downloading and executing a known version of a program in most non-trivial repos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Found this a lot easier to follow. https://blog.howardjohn.info/posts/go-tools-command/And didn't quite understand the euphoria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845323</guid></item><item><title>26.

You've explained it three times to me - in the initial post, on the website and here in the comments but I've still had trouble fully grasping the solution fully.Correct me if I'm wrong but is this essentially a really simple to use abstraction over the common tools used to create mixed-reality environments?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prompt quality and knowing your domain is critical. One issue I had early on was experimenting with LLMs to generate a frontend application in a brand new framework I was unfamiliar with (Svelte at the time) which lead to situations where I would cruise along and get stuck in a loop. The other issue came from the increasing context size that led to more unpredictable behaviors (i would ask it to change the color of a button and it would completely change the entire page).almost all the tools i've used to date for designing frontend framework, none really replaces using cursor and being able to dive deep, however cline does seem to have gotten significantly better.the day where you can come back to a fully working web app with moderate complexity after cleaning the gutter is still some way off but thats the dream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like looking at stack overflow for coding examples and seeing a couple of nerds getting angry at each other about the best way to do stuff. or some interesting other ways of doing stuff. this is also why i come to HN! so its weird when people want to drop that small joy from their workday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks outdated by now. Try R1.Seriously, I've been using LLMs for coding for a while and can say early experience was disappointing, but they get better and better fast. The latest o1 looks a lot better than 4o. It's reasonable to expect with proper human supervision and interface they will be able to handle big files and projects in a year or two.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't be so quick to attribute the embellished biographies to AI.  That's certainly a possibility, but it's also just as possible that these are humans going off of verbal/oral histories that morphed in the ongoing game of Telephone.  Plenty of humans get things mixed up, after all.Still, it's worth being vigilant about this sort of thing, AI or no - and LLMs are certainly increasing in the quality and quantity of bullshit they can produce.  People give Wikipedia a lot of flack for being "editable by everyone", but the emphasis on providing actual citations for claims is an important one - to the point that I'll readily trust an "amateur"/"hobbyist" work that cites its sources over a "professional" work that doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not very anti-LLM/AI, but this is one of the scarier parts, to me at least.Data that is obscure, not easily fact-checked, and (outside of a 
handful of people) there's no motivation to fact check it.Incorrect data will sit there, mostly viewed by other bots,
incorporated into the next model. The issue is just going to snowball.Good luck to any future historians that want to look back at
this time period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Law of Unintended Consequences is unavoidable; as so often I read this post, and said, "Yes, that's just what would happen.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jazz Jackrabbit employs some really unique VGA programming to do fast blitting. Relatively many people are familiar with linear mode (64K of usable memory, fast blitting but no double buffering) and mode X (256K memory, complicated or slow blitting, and double buffering at 320x240).Jazz was as far as I know the only game to use odd/even mode, which is normally used for text mode, for 256 color graphics. It gives 128K of memory, extremely fast blitting and double buffering at 320x200 and is a super interesting hack, but it's almost completely undocumented. I only found out because QEMU made a mess of it until I decided I wanted to play some Jazz. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently discounted on GOG, at 0.65 usd, with all the media.
 https://www.gog.com/en/game/jazz_jackrabbit_collection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks and sounds great, and works at resolutions greater than 320x200!  The game content consists of raster tiles and sprites, so I've just set to to 640x400, which works great on my 1920x1200 display.Although that website contains what must be the most egregious misuse of a hamburger menu I've ever seen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831927</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counterexample: Ive been able to complete more side projects in the last month leveraging llms than i have ever in my life. One of which I believe to have potential as a viable product, and another which involved complicated rust `no_std` and linker setup  for compiling rust code onto bare metal RISCV from scratch.I think the key to being successful here is to realize that you're still at the wheel as an engineer. The llm is there to rapidly synthesize the universe of information.You still need to 1) have solid fundamentals in order to  have an intuition against that synthesis, and 2) be experienced enough to translate that synthesis into actionable outcomes.If youre lacking in either, youre at the same whims of copypasta that have always existed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience LLMs will help you with things that have been solved thousands of times before and are just a matter of finding some easily researched solution.The very moment when you try to go off the beaten path and do something unconventional or stuff that most people won't have written a lot about, it gets more tricky. Just consider how many people will know how to configure some middleware in a Node.js project... vs most things related to hardware or low level work. Or even working with complex legacy codebases that have bits of code with obscure ways of interacting and more levels of abstraction that can be reasonably put in context.Then again, if an LLM gets confused, then a person might as well. So, personally I try to write code that'd be understandable by juniors and LLMs alike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Claude to help me build a side project in 4 hours that I would never have built otherwise. Essentially, it's a morphing wavetable oscillator in React (https://waves.tashian.com).Six months ago, I tried building this app with ChatGPT and got nowhere fast.Building it with Claude required a gluing together a few things that I didn't know much about: JavaScript audio processing, drawing on a JavaScript canvas, an algorithm for bilinear interpolation.I don't write JavaScript often. But I know how to program and I understand what I'm looking at. The project came together easily and the creative momentum of it felt great to me. The most amazing moment was when I reported a bug—I told Claude that the audio was stuttering whenever I moved the controls—and it figured out that we needed to use an AudioWorklet thread instead of trying to play the audio directly from the React component. I had never even heard of AudioWorklet. Claude refactored my code to use the AudioWorklet, and the stutter disappeared.I wouldn't have built this without Claude, because I didn't need it to exist that badly. Claude reduced the creative inertia just enough for me to get it done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845933</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some commenters mentioned that the e-ink screen (and the accompanying battery life) was one reason why the Pebble is so beloved, which reminded me of the Basis Peak, which was primarily a health tracker watch with some (very limited) smart functionality (mostly just some notifications, if I recall), that also had an e-ink screen and a nearly 1 week battery life and had a sort of similar trajectory:Bought by Intel, then killed two years later after a battery related recall issue.It was, in my opinion, by far the best fitness tracker watch ever, and remains so to this day. Not so much because of it's actual features (which were relatively standard), but the software paradigm of simple yet effective exercise gamification that helped encourage exercise habit formation. 8 years later and I still miss it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well now we have a conundrum - the top 3 posts on the frontpage are all about this!The submitted title of this post was "Google has open-sourced the pebble smartwatch operating system" but it actually points to https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html, so I've changed the title and moved the comments from here to https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845070, which has the Google announcement.The 3 threads are:We're bringing Pebble back - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845091Google open-sources the Pebble OS - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845070The future of Rebble - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845017 (&lt;-- you are here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a little confused at the moving pieces here.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I the only one not that impressed with Deepseek R1? Its "thinking" seems full of the usual LLM blindsides, and ultimately generating more of it then summarizing doesn't seem to overcome any real limits.It's like making mortgage backed securities out of bad mortgages, you never really overcome the badness of the underlying loans, no matter how many layers you pile on topI haven't used or studied DeepSeek R1 (or o1) in exhaustive depth, but I guess I'm just not understanding the level of breathless hype right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the uninitiated, this is the same author as the many other "The Illustrated..." blog posts.A particularly popular one: https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/Always very high quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do we know which changes made DeepSeek V3 so much faster and better at training than other models? DeepSeek R1's performances seem to be highly related to V3 being a very good model to start with.I went through the paper and I understood they made these improvements compared to "regular" MoE models:1. Latent Multi-head Attention. If I understand correctly, they were able to do some caching on the attention computation. This one is still a little bit confusing to me;2. New MoE architecture with one shared expert and a large number of small routed experts (256 total, but 8 in use in the same token inference). This was already used in DeepSeek v2;3. Better load balancing of the training of experts. During training, they add bias or "bonus" value to experts that are less used, to make them more likely to be selected in the future training steps;4. They added a few smaller transformer layers to predict not only the first next token, but a few additional tokens. Their training error/loss function then uses all these predicted tokens as input, not only the first one. This is supposed to improve the transformer capabilities in predicting sequences of tokens;5. They are using FP8 instead of FP16 when it does not impact accuracy.It's not clear to me which changes are the most important, but my guess would be that 4) is a critical improvement.1), 2), 3) and 5) could explain why their model trains faster by some small factor (+/- 2x), but neither the 10x advertised boost nor how is performs greatly better than models with way more activated parameters (e.g. llama 3).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845488</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA recently experienced an unprecedented loss of nearly $600 billion in its market capitalization, marking the most significant drop in value ever recorded for a company. This decline stems from a combination of factors, including disappointing earnings, reduced demand for chips following the COVID-19 pandemic-driven surge, and broader market sell-offs affecting tech stocks. Despite previous growth driven by advances in artificial intelligence and gaming, the drastic market cap reduction reflects investor concerns over NVIDIA's future profitability and competitive positioning within the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Thier pricing normally is pretty decent, but they keep the BF deals going pretty much all year [2].I've been using them for 6 years with no issues. I use it now with all my domains and never have any deliverability issues.The owner (Jar - one person shop again) is passionate about their email reputation for deliverability and is active on both lowendtalk and the dedicated sub Reddit.I ended up comparing purleymail and mxroute - tested mxroute and stayed with them.[1] https://mxroute.com/
[2] https://mxroute.blackfriday/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also use this. Pros: super cheap. &lt;$2/mo for all my custom email addresses and routing rules. Nothing else came close - everything else I found would make me pay per email address even if that address receives an average of 0 emails per month. The wildcard suffixes are really nice as well - they use _ instead of gmail's + (I've had issues with gmail's version as it sometimes is transparently removed, or sometimes the form doesn't consider + a valid character).Cons: UI is bad, so you'll want to access through a client. 1 person shop. Not audited AFAIK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customer for a few years now. I don't do anything fancy with it.  It was the cheapest and most appealing option for a custom domain for personal email.  I think it runs me ~$11 a year or somethingI combine it with simplelogin to handle all my aliasing needs.Thanks for the great service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42836818</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Non-Random Uniform Disk Sampling (NRUDS) method, which aims to enhance the efficiency of sampling in computer graphics and related fields. NRUDS provides a systematic approach to sample points uniformly across a disk, improving upon traditional random sampling techniques by reducing variance and ensuring more even distribution of points. The author explains the algorithm's workings, its advantages over random methods, and its applications, particularly in contexts requiring precise spatial distributions. The piece ultimately highlights the significance of NRUDS in optimizing computational processes in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know exactly what's he doing, but if I was doing some kind of monte carlo integration (like the family of energy surfaces in 6-dimensional space that I plotted the volume of as a function of energy for my PhD thesis) I'd be really concerned about the "uniform" part.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence[2] https://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of...[3] https://numerical.recipes/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having one point at the center does not feel intuitive. For example the N=19 feels like it would be more uniform as same as N=20 but without center point. Similarly N=3 could be just the points on the outer circle, similar to what N=4 is now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This subject has been studied in depth before, hasn't it? E.g. Shirley's mapping, which can be combined with a low-discrepancy sequence such as Hammersley.Here is an introduction for those curious: https://towardsdatascience.com/unit-disk-uniform-sampling-91...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42843252</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article envisions what OpenSSL, a widely used toolkit for implementing SSL and TLS protocols, would look like if it were designed as a graphical user interface (GUI) application. It emphasizes the user experience, illustrating that a GUI could simplify complex tasks, such as managing SSL certificates and configurations, making it more accessible for users who are less technically inclined. The discussion highlights the challenges faced by developers and operators in navigating OpenSSL’s command-line interface, suggesting that a GUI could streamline workflows and improve security practices by providing a more intuitive way to handle cryptographic operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actually, the example has way better discoverability than most CLI software, especially if every option had tooltips illustrating what it's for in more detail.For an actually good example of adjacent software, have a look at Keystore Explorer: https://keystore-explorer.org/I do manage my own CA for some development servers with it, way less of a headache than trying to remember a bunch of arbitrary commands (though obviously not well suited for any sort of automation, which I don't need in that specific use case).For an example of a pleasant CLI with some good discoverability, I've always liked Docker's approach, where the commands are organized in a tree and entering a command without any arguments will print its usage in a useful format: https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/  $&gt;docker
  
  Usage:  docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND
  
  A self-sufficient runtime for containers
  
  Common Commands:
    run         Create and run a new container from an image
    exec        Execute a command in a running container
    ps          List containers
    build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
    pull        Download an image from a registry
    push        Upload an image to a registry
    images      List images
    login       Log in to a registry
    logout      Log out from a registry
    search      Search Docker Hub for images
    version     Show the Docker version information
    info        Display system-wide information
  
  ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite part is the punchline:“This is incomplete. It covers about 80% of one corner of OpenSSL's functionality. The certificate policy options have a lot more knobs that I didn't include.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may be a nice example of the benefits and drawbacks of GUI vs CLI software.Sure OpenSSL has myriad inscrutable options, but the majority of these probably aren't going to be used by 90% of people.
Yet including them in a CLI gives less clutter/overhead versus what they would in a GUI.
They can just stay out of the way for the people who need them.I guess the same could be said of an "Advanced Features" second page of a GUI though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42837462</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would rather conclude that automatic vectorizers are still less than ideal, despite SIMD instructions have been widely available in commodity processors for 25 years now.The language is actually great with SIMD, you just have to do it yourself with intrinsics, or use libraries. BTW, here’s a library which implements 4-wide vectorized exponent functions for FP32 precision on top of SSE, AVX and NEON SIMD intrinsics (MIT license): https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath/blob/oct2024/Inc/Di...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The argument seems to be that C isn't suited to SIMD because some functions (exp, for instance) are not.  But it then talks about how exp is implemented in hardware, in a way that forces it to be a non-SIMD calculation.  That's not a C issue, that's a CPU issue.  No language can save you there (unless it uses a software-only function for exp).Is this article really confused, or did I misunderstand it?The thing that makes C/C++ a good language for SIMD is how easily it lets you control memory alignment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So are those functional languages.  The really cool SIMD code I see people writing now is by people like Lemire using the latest extensions who do clever things like decoding UTF-8 which I think will always take assembly language to express unless you are getting an SMT solver to write it for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42808027</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting.  RTOS is a major embedded ecosystem component that rust currently lacks.For anyone not familiar: NuttX is notable as the RTOS used on the open-source PX4 flight controller firmware, which is ubiquitous in commercial UASs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some years into Rust firmware with no classic RTOS experience: I get the feeling that embedded async Rust is a little like an RTOS library toolkit. Why do you need an OS abstraction when you can handcraft an embedded async runtime? Component reuse?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So like, taking a step back, is NuttX POSIX or POSIX-like (if there's a file namespace with /dev in it / you can use the Nix package)?And... does it have a global memory allocator (using stdlib packages that use alloc)?  I can't really tell if this is an RTOS for microcontrollers or like, 32-bit ARM and don't have any background on it.  And how does that interact with RTOS guarantees?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42843989</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Been there, done that. Useless in a home/lab environment. For a data-center - maybe.In my experience, the oil is far from odourless. It seems that way at first, but after a while it saturates the room/house with very annoying smell. Several months later, and I had to get rid of that smell. Even went as far to build stainless steel tanks with gaskets used for car motors. But, when airtight, the whole thing looses it's thermal properties and starts overheating again. I guess because of pressure build-up. So, it is either endure the mineral oil vapors, or nothing.On top of all that, pray you never need to replace/upgrade a component... getting the whole thing out of the oil and cleaning it up so you could handle it again - a nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My buddy and I did this with a $1/ gallon fish tank, 8 gallons of horse laxative (heavy mineral oil - real cheap way to buy it in bulk) and a spare gaming pcs guts. it worked but wasn't impressed after it heat saturates - you definitely need to cool the oil after say 8 to 12 hours otherwise it probably is worse than air cooling.the other downside is you absolutely need to dishwasher anything that was submerged and it makes one hell of a mess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More moden take https://immersion-cooling.thermaltake.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42813058</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had a Fremont manufactured 2021 Model 3. It failed the 3 year inspection (we live in Sweden) due to fog light being way off and hitch. Turns out the fog light mount had broke off. The whole front fascia was replaced.Before the inspection I had the tail lights replaced twice, headlights replaced once and so many other things they'd find when I dropped it off for service. The boot hatch hydraulics was missing gaskets. TPMS was defective on delivery. Panel gaps of course. I had so much water in the first tail lights I could house a betta.When Twitler started fighting the unions we sold that incident number on wheels and got a Volvo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know about the US, but in the EU almost all other brands have some kind of mandatory maintenance (and may void warranty if not performed on time) that may catch certain issues before the periodic inspection. Tesla is famous for not having a maintenance plan.For EVs in particular, you almost never have to use the brakes, and if you don't burnish your brakes from time to time, the rotors may end up rusting or worse, especially in northern counties that use road salt in winter.Some other well known issues with Model 3s and Ys are poor headlight height calibration and upper/lower lateral links that fail way too early.The thing with all of these issues is that most Tesla owners are told that they don't need to perform any maintenance, and while that may be the case, you should at least inspect your car from time to time to detect these issues. You can even do most of this on your own (brake burnishing each year, headlight calibration, and more).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not just the 3. I just sold my X after four years, during which it accumulated faults which required 13 service appointments to fix, 3 of which were "car is completely dead".Every Tesla owner I know tells me stories of the faults their car has had.Even without Elon becoming a literal fascist, there's no way I was going to keep my X out of warranty, and I will never buy another Tesla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42838855</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An 80% size reduction is no joke, and the fact that the 1.58-bit version runs on dual H100s at 140 tokens/s is kind of mind-blowing. That said, I’m still skeptical about how practical this really is for most people. Like, yeah, you can run it on 24GB VRAM or even with just 20GB RAM, but "slow" is an understatement—those speeds would make even the most patient person throw their hands up.And then there’s the whole repetition issue. Infinite loops with "Pygame’s Pygame’s Pygame’s" kind of defeats the point of quantization if you ask me. Sure, the authors have fixes like adjusting the KV cache or using min_p, but doesn’t that just patch a symptom rather than solve the actual problem? A fried model is still fried, even if it stops repeating itself.On the flip side, I love that they’re making this accessible on Hugging Face... and the dynamic quantization approach is pretty brilliant. Using 1.58-bit for MoEs and leaving sensitive layers like down_proj at higher precision—super clever. Feels like they’re squeezing every last drop of juice out of the architecture, which is awesome for smaller teams who can’t afford OpenAI-scale hardware."accessible" still comes with an asterisk. Like, I get that shared memory architectures like a 192GB Mac Ultra are a big deal, but who’s dropping $6,000+ on that setup? For that price, I’d rather build a rig with used 3090s and get way more bang for my buck (though, yeah, it’d be a power hog). Cool tech—no doubt—but the practicality is still up for debate. Guess we'll see if the next-gen models can address some of these trade-offs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random observation 1: I was running DeepSeek yesterday on my Linux with a RTX 4090 and I noticed that the models should fit into VRAM, which is 24GB. Or they are simply slow. So the Apple shared memory architecture has an advantage here. A 192GB Mx Ultra can load and process large models efficiently.Random observation 2: It's time to cancel the OpenAI subscription.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, an 80% reduction in size for DeepSeek-R1 is just amazing! It's fantastic to see such large models becoming more accessible to those of us who don't have access to top-tier hardware. This kind of optimization opens up so many possibilities for experimenting at home.I'm impressed by the 140 tokens per second speed with the 1.58-bit quantization running on dual H100s. That kind of performance makes the model practical for small or mid sized shops to use it for local applications. This is a huge win for people working on agents that require low latency that only local models could support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42850222</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their SLAP demo provides a great example of how defence-in-depth can make/break the viability of an exploit. That terrifying Safari demo is possible because Safari fails to isolate new windows in individual processes when calling `window.open` in js.All the other side channel magic presented here doesn't matter if the data you want to read is in a seperate process with sufficient separation from the "hostile" process in the address space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool detail, in the section where they reverse-engineer the presence of an LVP on the M3:    Remarkably, while all other load widths activate the LVP
    on any constant value fitting that width, we observe that acti-
    vation on 8-byte wide loads occurs only when the load value
    is zero. We conjecture that this may be a countermeasure for
    memory safety such that the LVP will not learn values of
    pointers. That is, with the M3 being a 64-bit CPU, pointers
    are 8 bytes wide. Furthermore, on 64-bit macOS executables,
    any virtual address below 0x100, 000, 000 is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm, one part i found interesting&gt; In order to make cache hits distinguishable from misses
in Safari, we reference the NOT gate-based cache amplifica-
tion primitive from [29, Section 5], adjusting the speculation
parameters for the M2 CPU. We run the amplifier 500 times
when the target address is cached and 500 more times when
it is evicted, in native and WebAssembly implementations.
Table 3 summarizes the timing distributions, with units in
ms. We observe that they are clearly separable even in a
web environment, allowing us to distinguish cache hits from
misses with WebKit’s 1 ms timer.So i guess all the hub hub around disabling fine resolution timers and SharedArrayBuffer was for naught.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42856023</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Desmos is an online graphing calculator and mathematics platform that provides tools for visualizing and exploring mathematical concepts. It allows users to plot graphs, create interactive simulations, and solve equations, making it a valuable resource for students and educators. The platform also offers a variety of educational activities and lessons, enhancing the learning experience in mathematics at various levels. Desmos promotes engagement with math through its user-friendly interface and dynamic visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used Desmos quite a bit as an instructional tool for high school math. They are funded through relationships with several companies, but most notably the standardized testing industry, which uses it with their online tests.Over ten years before Desmos launched, there began an open source project called Geogebra (https://www.geogebra.org/). Geogebra remains open source to this day and offers a similar suite of applications and calculators, both online and in app form.Over the years I have also used Geogebra as an instructional tool in both my math and physics classrooms, producing dozens of apps, simulators, and gizmos: https://www.geogebra.org/u/mrdathhsGeogebra excels at creating mathematical simulations. One of my favorites was this real-time satellite orbit calculator: https://www.geogebra.org/m/UEynuRnG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish I could get a dedicated handheld graphing calculator that hasn't had most of the functionality removed due to standardized testing.  We live in an age of miracles but having a decent solver on a dedicated device is apparently commercially impossible because it couldn't be sold to students.I'm just a dude in my shop that occasionally would like to integrate a thing or two without getting coolant on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High school students taking the digital SAT get near-full access to Desmos throughout the math portion of the test (it’s a modified version, but you get access to practically everything). It’s very powerful, and if you can use it effectively, you can brute force hard questions in seconds. Graphing calculators have been available during the SAT in the past, but Desmos is something else… I wonder how it effects score distributions/question difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42816133</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides information about the "Machine Learning in Practice" course at Carnegie Mellon University for the Spring 2025 semester. It outlines the course goals, objectives, and structure, emphasizing hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques. The site includes details about the syllabus, assignments, and evaluation criteria, as well as resources for students to enhance their learning. There is a focus on collaboration and practical applications, preparing students to apply machine learning concepts in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The material is definitely practical—Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins are all industry-standard tools, and the focus on MLOps is refreshing. It’s great to see a course bridge the gap between ML and actual production systems, not just stop at building models. Love that they're also tackling explainability, fairness, and monitoring. These are the things that often get overlooked in practice.Is it too entry-level? Looking at the labs, a lot of this seems like stuff a mid-level software engineer (or even a motivated beginner) could pick up on their own with tutorials. Git, Flask, container orchestration... all useful, but pretty basic for anyone who's already worked in production environments. The deeper challenges—like optimizing networking for distributed training or managing inference at scale—don’t seem to get as much attention. Maybe it comes up in the group projects?Also wondering about the long-term relevance of some of the tools they’re using. Jenkins? Sure, it’s everywhere, but wouldn’t it make sense to introduce something more modern like GitHub Actions or ArgoCD for CI/CD? Same with Kubernetes—obviously a must-know, but what about alternatives or supplementary tools for edge deployments or serverless systems? Feels like an opportunity to push into the future a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to have very little on Data Quality and it is on Chapter 16...How much practical experience in Industry do the authors have? Because 90% of your time will be spent on Data Quality and Data Cleansing...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there somewhere I could follow along with other non students?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847834</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against GoDaddy, alleging that the company failed to maintain adequate data security for its website hosting services, which led to significant breaches affecting customer information. The FTC claims that GoDaddy's lax security measures allowed unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data, including personal information of customers. This enforcement action is part of the FTC's broader initiative to ensure that companies take necessary precautions to safeguard consumer data and uphold strong cybersecurity practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing that (approximately) no one cares about stuff like this.GoDaddy was severely breached several times over several years, yet they still rake in billions of revenue from their millions of customers. Now they have to pay someone to fill out a biennial checklist and... promise to not lie. Awesome.If you own a company, why even bother with security? Security is expensive. Wait until a breach is exposed, offer $10 credit monitoring (at best), accept the free press coverage, maybe pinky promise to not lie if you've been particularly egregious in your handling of multiple incidents, and then carry on like normal. (This is tongue-in-cheek, I work in security, but I am frustrated with how often stories like this one occur)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GoDaddy is one of the sleaziest companies I know of.I ran a website hosted on GoDaddy for a local business when the server cluster was hacked. GoDaddy admitted it was their fault, but the business ended up having to pay me to fix the site. GoDaddy also managed to convince the business to pay for an additional monthly "security" plan, which included page caching. They set everything up over the phone without talking to me at all.The next day I notice some odd behavior with the admin pages, then realize they're being cached, not only that but they're now publicly accessible. GoDaddy's improved security plan ended up being responsible for a data leak. They really screwed up twice but there was zero penalty, the only consequence was they made more money. The business chose to stay with GoDaddy, despite my recommendations. They saw the ads on TV and were convinced GoDaddy is the pinnacle of web hosting.Also, check this out: https://www.butterflyave.com/Those assholes have parked my old business name, and want to sell it back to me for $1,499.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SendGrid, pre IPO, had a GoDaddy security incident: someone social engineered one of the GoDaddy support reps into giving them control of our domain. We were able to re-secure the domain before the attacker fully locked us out. They could have powned all of our email links.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42849632</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article announces that researchers from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) have confirmed the existence of a "super-Earth" located in the habitable zone of a nearby star. This exoplanet, which is larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, is positioned in an area where conditions may support liquid water, making it a candidate for potential life. The discovery adds to the growing understanding of where habitable planets may exist beyond our solar system, highlighting the importance of ongoing astronomical research and observations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next year there is a plan to send a space telescope to L2 with the main objective being to search for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars in the habitable zone.Like Kepler and TESS telescopes it will use the transit method to find new exoplanets, but unlike any mission before, it's going to look at the same spot in the sky for over a year. Super excited to see what data it brings back to us.The telescope is called PLATO ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(spacecraft) )I contributed to the project a few years back, very happy to answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let me remind you guys that "just 20 light years" = roughly 200 trillion kms. At the speed of voyager 1, it takes roughly 1600 yrs to travel 1 trillion kms. 200 trillion kms would take 320,000 years to reach there. Even if you increased the speed of voyager 1 by 10 times, it would still take 32000 years to reach. We really need to up the speed by a factor of 10000 before we can get anywhere close to human lifetime achievable travel times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The existence of the Super-earth was not directly observed, but was instead inferred by the gravitational lensing of all the democracy[0] being spread in a sphere around the planet.[0] https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Earth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853174</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;Dragonsweeper is an indie puzzle game inspired by the classic Minesweeper, where players navigate a grid to uncover tiles while avoiding dragons hidden beneath. The objective is to clear the board by deducing the locations of dragons based on numerical clues provided by adjacent tiles. The game features various difficulty levels and challenges players with strategic thinking and careful planning. It offers a unique twist on the traditional Minesweeper format, appealing to fans of puzzle games and those seeking a fresh gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool design, I am not sure if some boards are unsolvable or if I suck though. Some hints:  * It works similar to minesweeper so hints/patters for minesweeper also applies. 
 https://minesweeper.online/help/patterns
  * Prefer levelling up to heal over the hearts. You can use hearts later for bigger heals
  * Don't level up unless needed to. Try to hit 0 heart before levelling up.
  * Point is exploring as much as possible
  * You can use right mouse button to mark cells with numbers or X (for mine). If you figure out a cell don't open it unless you want to explore that area. If not just mark them and leave them. Later when you need to heal/level up, you can kill those marked cells for extra XP with no cost since the health you have will be wasted anyway.
  * While picking up hearts again prefer the ones that in areas you want to explore into
  * To make things easier, at the beginning you can just open random cells that are far away from the orbs. If you die, you won't lose much :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since I couldn't find a description of the rules anywhere:- Spaces contain monsters of various levels (numbers) and cause your character to lose that amount of HP when clicked. They drop the same amount of gold which you use to level up.- Leveling up fully heals you and you gain 1 max HP- You'll need to explore the map beating enough low level monsters to continuously level up while managing your HP. You CAN go to zero HP but not below.- Get to level 15 and defeat the dragon to win the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of fun with this last week, played 10-20 games. It does reach a point where you can beat every game, I found myself craving an extended version that introduces some new elements.One gripe, the code is incredibly inefficient - my laptop fan was running full speed and battery draining fast, while the game board just sits there with no animations or anything going on. Should be basically using 0% CPU while idle.Anyway really fun concept &amp; execution, and great game design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42812157</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Slack Overflow," a phenomenon where excessive communication through platforms like Slack can lead to overwhelming information overload and decreased productivity for teams. It emphasizes the need for establishing clear communication guidelines, setting boundaries around messaging, and utilizing tools and strategies to manage team communication effectively. The piece suggests best practices for reducing the noise in digital communication environments, ensuring that important messages are noticed while minimizing distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

(If I got that right, I think that's part of what is offered here.) Where I work, we have several layers in between engineering and the end users and ... while there's a lot to be said for increasing focus and reducing distractions, I think it's also nice to have the unfiltered contact sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42811146</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of the shebang line in scripts, specifically focusing on the application of the `#!/usr/bin/env uv` shebang. It explains how this ensures that the script utilizes the appropriate version of the UV (Universal Virtual) runtime, providing flexibility in execution across different environments. The article highlights the benefits of using `env` for locating the interpreter, promoting best practices in scripting and environment management, and offers practical examples for users to implement in their own scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, today I learned about env -S - when I saw the shebang line in the article, I immediately thought "that doesn't work on Linux, shebang lines can only pass a single argument". Basically, running foo.py starting with    #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script

causes the OS run really run env with only two arguments, namely the shebang line as one argument and the script's filename as the second argument, i.e.:    /usr/bin/env '-S uv run --script' foo.py

However, the -S flag of env causes env to split everything back into separate arguments! Very cool, very useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not using shebang, but I've recently been using uv as an "installer". It's hard to package and distribute python CLI tools with complex dependencies. I used uv in a couple of novel ways:1. I copied their `curl | sh` install script and added a `uv tool install --python python3.12 my-tool` line at the end. So users can now install my CLI tool with a nice curl-pipe-sh one-liner.2. I made a tiny pypi "installer" package that has "uv" as its only dependency. All it does is  `uv tool install` my CLI tool.Both methods install the CLI tool, python3.12 and all python dependencies in their own isolated environment. Users don't need to manage python virtual envs. They don't need to even have python installed for the curl-pipe-sh method.I now get far fewer GitHub issues from users who have somehow mangled the complex dependencies of my tool.I wrote it up with more detail and links to code:https://aider.chat/2025/01/15/uv.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of funny shebangs, I came up with this to shell execute prolog .pl files, but it should work for any scripting language that has /**/-comments but doesn't support #-comments or #! shebangs specifically:    /*usr/bin/env scryer-prolog "$0" "$@" ; exit #*/

From my original comment https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/issues/2170#issuecomm... :&gt; The way this works is that this test.pl is both a valid shell file and prolog file. When executing as shell the first line finds and executes /usr/bin/env after searching for the glob pattern /*usr/bin/env. env then executes scryer-prolog "test.pl" which runs the prolog file as a module and halts; of course prolog ignores the first line as a comment /* ... */. Then the shell continues and executes the next command after ; which is exit which stops execution so the rest of the file (which is not valid shell) is ignored. The # makes the shell evaluator ignore prolog comment closer */ to prevent it from printing an error.This may be the best and worst thing I have ever created.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855258</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Martin Kleppmann's presentation at the O'Reilly O'Reilly Developers Conference (Oredev) in 2015, where he explores the inner workings of databases. He emphasizes the importance of understanding database systems, their structures, and the complexities involved in their design and operation. The presentation covers topics such as data models, consistency, scalability, and the trade-offs between different database architectures. Kleppmann aims to provide insights into how databases function internally to help developers make informed decisions when working with data storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We did this style on top of plain MSSQL. Each event would have a SQL table which is the primary storage. Then we have workers that listens to new data in tables and updates projections we needed. (Sometimes DB triggers but mostly async workers.)The main issue is "listening to new data in a SQL table". I wrote this code to achieve it in MSSQL (perhaps it is somehow built into postgres?): https://github.com/vippsas/mssql-changefeedIn my experience this approach is beautiful; as Martins says, our backend code is mostly stateless and functional these days, why have mutable objects in the DB? And the approach is extremely useful for dry-running business logic etcBut we didn't like the prospect of adopting Kafka wholesale. Having all the data in a SQL DB is extremely convenient for debugging, and since we already used SQL it was a smaller change that was done first where it made most sense and then spread out.It would be great with more DB features targeting this style. Explicit partition event tables (kafka-in-SQL), and writing a projection simply as a SQL query which is inverted into an async trigger by the DB would be awesome. (MSSQL has indexed views, but it cannot be done online...)Materialize is the DB I know about in this territory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is also known as event sourcing [0] and is a common pattern used inside of databases, in git, in lots of popular software.I don't generally recommend it for every application as the tooling is not as well integrated as it is in an RDBMS and the data model doesn't fit every use-case.However, if you have a system that needs to know "when" something happened in an on-going process, it can be a very handy architecture... although with data-retention laws it can get tricky quickly (among other reasons).[0] https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing I always get stuck on with these techniques is, how do you handle transactions which perform validations/enforce invariants on data when you’re just writing writes to a log and computing materialized views down the line? How can you do essentially, an “add item to shopping cart” if for example, users can only have max 10 items and so you need to validate that there aren’t already 10 items in the cart?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828720</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear in mind that the placebo effect from DBS for Parkinson's is 39% of the active treatment, so you can't really tell much from a single unblinded patient report.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S13538...Here is a meta-analysis of DBS for Parkinson's: https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/3/1/e000705Principal findings:"All results had a high risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence was very low for all primary outcomes. The information size was insufficient when assessing all cause mortality. Meta-analysis showed that deep brain stimulation increased the risk of serious adverse events, mainly because of an increased risk of perioperative complications, such as cerebral haemorrhages and postoperative confusion, and events related to hardware, such as infection at the stimulator site, dislocation of the device, or reoperations. Meta-analyses indicated that deep brain stimulation might reduce symptoms specific to Parkinson's disease, but the assessments of disease specific symptoms had several methodological limitations."So, it's an interesting treatment, but more evidence is needed before we can conclude that it is actually helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so the short story is - at the moment, the device is basically doing power spectra analysis w/ FFT and such from local field potential recordings, and only turning the device on when it's detecting a strong ~20 hz band.Helps w/ motor symptoms only - does NOT address any dementia/psychosis symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company makes DBS devices. There are a lot of other possible indications like migraine and others where it could help too but progress is very slow. You can't "move fast and break things" with brain implants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857293</guid></item><item><title>15.

Since we have access to the students, we can mobilize them and get this going. We will also be doing an internship program for 100,000 students in Telangana as part of Viswam[1] in April.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite fact about raindrop paths/watersheds is that they determine most of the political boundary between Argentina and Chile. If the rain at a point ultimately flows to the Pacific Ocean, that point is in Chile; if it flows to the Atlantic Ocean, it is in Argentina. This is article 1 of the original boundary treaty [0] from the 19th century.The treaty was made before the Andes were fully explored, and so it doesn't handle some interesting edges cases like the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. The field has the property that when rain falls there, it freezes and goes nowhere![0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Treaty_of_1881_betwee...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;VMS was the first multiuser system I used in 1991.  I was amazed that a single computer could have 300 users logged in all doing their own thing.I learned to program in C and tried using  Borland Turbo C on a DOS.  Go outside of the array index and you could easily crash the entire machine which meant reboot and try it again.   I thought the concept of memory protection was incredible!  Why didn't every computer have that?It was the first time I saw email, sending messages, and the phone utility for chatting with other users while waiting for your programs to run in the background.I moved on to an IBM RT running AIX and got hooked on Unix. That's the system I wanted and have been running Linux since 1994.  But VMS still holds a special place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VMS had asynchronous programming to its core. Most system calls could be performed synchronously or async. You just had to give the async call a flag that would indicate when the response was ready. So you could read a file or connect to the network, continue execution and when you actually needed the answer, just sys$wait(flag). Or have callback functions.
It worked extremely well as some else mentioned, 64Mb of RAM was enough to handle 200 interactive users with RDB (database IMO far superior to Oracle that was acquired by them and promptly buried)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first serious (multiuser) system experience was VMS. The concurrency, the power of DCL, the record based nature of files, the mail box concept for process communication, the accounting system, the granular privs, the cluster concept. I came to UNIX second and still miss some of these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42851519</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone, I'm the creator of Malimite.  I actually released this as part of a conference talk at Objective By the Sea, which you can see here:https://youtu.be/vWdKjVCZtTIIt gives a good overview of the development process as well as my motivations for creating it.  The tool will also be on homebrew shortly :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting this year I started learning bunch of security topics and Ghidra is something I started learning. I decompiled some games and getting comfortable how to work a project, teach Ghidra structures etc.Am I right in looking at Malimite here and reading "Built on top of Ghidra decompilation to offer direct support for Swift, Objective-C, and Apple resources." that this is not a Ghidra extension but rather it is using a piece of Ghidra (the decompilation) like a backend? Malimite here is presented as its own piece of software.Asking as a Ghidra noob who doesn't know all the ways Ghidra can be used: Would it make sense for something like this to be a Ghidra extension instead? I.e. give Ghidra some tooling/plugin to understand iOS apps or their languages better, instead of a new app that just uses parts of Ghidra. Also the Malimite screenshot in the page looks similar to Ghidra CodeBrowser tool.Asking because it feels like it could be: from the little I've used Ghidra so far, looks like it is designed to be extendable, scriptable, usable by a team collaborating, etc. And Ghidra seems more holistic than just focusing on decompiling code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(This is LLM-powered and based on Ghidra, fwiw)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829402</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're a 33-year-old small company, with thirty employees. I started the company in 1992 to do custom programming (VB and MS Access) and network support (Novell NetWare). I slowly grew to five employees. In 2000 I did not enjoy billing out our hours, so I decided to develop a product -- a web-based issue tracking application to help with IT support. The transition from a services business to a product business was much more difficult than I anticipated, but we made it. Now Issuetrak is doing fine. From what I read on Hacker News, there are nice aspects to working in a small company. We have no outside investment, so we call our own shots. Everyone is close to the customers. We listen to all team members' ideas. Everyone knows who is contributing. We can work from home. After 25 years of taking customer suggestions, our product is robust. We provide prompt, very good telephone support. We win deals (and lose them too) against competitors that are 400 times our size. One of the biggest satisfactions is that when we survey our customers after each support encounter, it is not unusual to hear them say that Issuetrak is the best software company they've ever dealt with. My salary is probably less than that of many FANG engineers, but life is good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CodeWeavers, which I am very lucky to be part of, is also an (almost) 30-year-old small company! We make Wine, Proton, and CrossOver, you might've heard of them. And I think we are hiring as well, please have a look!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope to be able to write this blog post in 20 years.  My co-founder and I started a bootstrapped company 3 years ago do IaC orchestration and we are slowly but steadily growing.  We love being small.  We love being accountable to our customers.  We love having the freedom to make decisions.  Yes, it's not always easy.  We explicitly don't want to be a billion dollar company.  We want to make a product that serves our niche exactly how they want to be served.  We're definitely making less money than if we worked at another company.  But we feel we can make it to our goal and think we'll be happy when there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847865</guid></item><item><title>22.

The method is pretty clever too - 2 photon absorption works only where the light is focused (and therefore high intensity). They use a lens array to create 49 focus points, allowing them to parallelize the printing of the repeating grid!Scalable 3D fab could have fun implications for materials like this, and for chip-scale photonics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Nano-architected materials are made of tiny building blocks or repeating units measuring a few hundred nanometres in size — it would take more than 100 of them patterned in a row to reach the thickness of a human hair."I am perpetually shocked that a structure (hair) that we can actually see is so close to nanoscale.(It's also noteworthy that our sense of touch in fact extends into the nanoscale: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857091</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how complexity physics can identify critical tipping points in chess games, highlighting the intricate dynamics involved in decision-making during play. Researchers have applied concepts from complexity science to analyze chess outcomes, revealing patterns that can predict when a game is likely to change in favor of one player or the other. This study not only enhances the understanding of chess strategies but also illustrates broader implications in the analysis of complex systems in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like an extremely convoluted way of demonstrating a very basic fact, that the authors of the study probably knew beforehand. And that's when a player's position has many weaknesses (or a high 'fragility score') they're probably going to be losing soon. And determining how quickly many pieces can attack a given point versus defend it is, more or less, exactly how you determine if that point is weak. Publish or perish reigns supreme.A lot of science feels like it's becoming much closer to art where you splash a canvas with a few splotches, and then spend an hour describing how it's an insightful representation of the isolation of the modern world and the struggle against depersonalization. At least there you get to then sell it for a few hundred thousand dollars, rather than just live to renew your contract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's really difficult to pick my least favourite part of this article. Could be this;"But the game is about more than algorithms, according to Marc Barthelemy, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies.Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further..."At least AI systems can write slop fairly well. Why do I hate this so much? It just feels lazy, underdone, superficial, vaguely nonsensical. The magic of chess has little or nothing todo with the "psychological complexity conferred by player strategies". It has much more to do with aesthetic beauty, and many a great writer has illuminated that. It's utterly unsurprising that you can model the game as nodes interacting in a network graph (I mean essentially that's what it is), and even more unsurprising that the complexity of the interactions is higher in the tense and complicated positions that do indeed often decide the fate of individual games. Note, games not matches. If you can't get even the most basic domain terminology correct, you don't deserve anyone's attention.I'll probably calm down in an hour or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829677</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction and evolution of SpeedChat, a chat system in Disney's virtual world Toontown. It highlights the motivations behind its creation, focusing on the need for a safer online environment for children. The piece outlines how SpeedChat aimed to simplify communication while ensuring safety by restricting vocabulary, and contrasts it with the previous open chat system. The author also reflects on the impact of this change on the gameplay experience and the community within Toontown.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was so fun to read, and reminded me of Virtual Magic Kingdom (VMK), Disney’s other popular mmo at the time which was basically a Disney-fied Habbo Hotel [1].It ran for about 3 years, but what I found interesting is the chat took the initial approach that the creators here dismissed: a whitelisted vocab list of safe words that you could type, and anything not on it would preclude the message from being sent.There were definitely ways around it, but I also presume active monitoring of the slang, because eventually words like “dam” or phrases “what the shell” were banned too. Another thing that I recall is that case-sensitive spelling mattered, and there was no word bank, so in a way it enforced better spelling.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Magic_Kingdom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engine [0] that was used for Toontown is still around and is open source. Uses both C++ and Python.[0] https://www.panda3d.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sure enough, chatters figured out a few simple protocols to pass their secret codeI played this game when I was a kid, and "discovered" one of these protocols myself. The only problem was maybe half of the kids wouldn't understand what you were trying to do. But there was a big joy in unlocking unrestricted chat with one of your close friends, who'd you'd previously only been able to chat with via canned messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829050</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is quite something. I suspect this person has a C++ background, because the thing where they're abusing the generic type system to do arithmetic is very much more like C++ template libraries than something you normally see in C#. The advantage seems to be that you can use MakeGenericType() in situations where the normal bytecode Emit() isn't available?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a fan of this particular repository by Jules Jacobs who similarly uses struct based generics (to create immutable collections.)https://github.com/julesjacobs/ImmutableCollections/discussi...It has similar "source generator" hallmarks like in OP's post, for example calling a generic constructor which is JITted to a deeply nested struct type.It's (in my opinion) very hard to reason what the code is doing because it has that flavor of "writing code to generate source to generate code"It's impressive. And i'm pretty sure it's only real hinderance, why it could not be adopted into the base library, is that the repo needs a phd holder to finish implementing the `IList` interface because deleting is really difficult and theoretical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post has a lot of similarities to the 'object algebra' paper by Bruno Oliveira.https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdfIf the OP author has any interest in doing a 1000x service to the C# community, the community needs a translator like you to convert the paper's compiler example into other domain specific examples. I'm pretty sure this paper went nowhere because it lacked a hello world example. something easier to digest and smaller and scope. The classic "dog is an animal and cat is an animal" level of explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828581</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The Bitwarden article on new device verification explains the process of ensuring that users can securely access their accounts on new devices. It details the steps for verification, including receiving a verification email or using two-step login (2SV) methods. The article emphasizes the importance of this security measure in protecting user data from unauthorized access and outlines troubleshooting tips for users who encounter issues during the verification process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to point out that the title is wrong. 2FA is on by default, but not mandatory. Dang, can we change the title?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is terrible, honestly. One of the reasons I use Bitwarden is to be able to not know all my passwords besides the Bitwarden one. I don't know my email password, so can't use that for 2FA. Same for using my phone number or an authenticator app, if I lose my phone, I would also be locked out of my account.The risk of someone stealing my phone is much higher than someone stealing my main password where I live. I intentionally decided not to use 2FA, because that is what makes most sense for my context. I'm ready to take full responsibility for not using 2FA, but now I can't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can understand adding some friction to discourage using Bitwarden without 2FA, but requiring it seems very wrongheaded to make it mandatory. I've been using 2FA on Bitwarden for a while and it adds a lot of friction and made me very nervous that if I lost my phone that I'd be locked out of literally every account I have. I mentioned elsewhere (link below) that I have solved this issue for myself, but people shouldn't be required to jump through these hoops and introduce a greater opportunity to lose access to their accounts if they should lose their phone.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853696&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853696</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses DeepSeek, a tool designed to bypass online censorship by allowing users to access and search for information typically restricted in certain regions. It elaborates on the technical aspects of how DeepSeek operates, including the use of advanced algorithms to locate uncensored content while maintaining user privacy. The author emphasizes the importance of free access to information and the impact of censorship on society, highlighting the ongoing struggle against oppressive regimes that limit freedom of expression. Additionally, the article provides insights into the challenges faced in the development of such tools and the common countermeasures employed by censors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858552"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few observations, based on a family member experimenting with DeepSeek.  I'm pretty sure it was running locally.  I'm not sure if it was built from source.The censorship seemed to be based on keywords, applied the input prompt and the output text.  If asked about events in 1990, then asked about events in the previous year DeepSeek would start generating tokens about events in 1989.  Eventually it would hit the word "Tiananmen", at which point it would partially print the word, then in response to a trigger delete all the tokens generated to date and replace them with a message to the effect of "I'm a nice AI and don't talk about such things."If the word Tiananmen was in the prompt, the "I'm a nice AI" message would immediately appear, with no tokens generated.If Tiananmen was misspelled in the prompt, the prompt would be accepted.  DeepSeek would spot the spelling mistake early in its reasoning and start generating tokens until it actually got around to printing to the word Tiananmen, at which point it would delete everything and print the "nice AI" message.I'm no expert on these things, but it looked like the censorship isn't baked into the model but is an external bolt on.  Does this gel with other's observations?  What's the take of someone who knows more and has dived into the source code?Edit: Consensus seems to be that this instance was not being run locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Next up: 1,156 prompts censored by ChatGPTIf published this would, to my knowledge, be the first time anyone has systematically explored which topics ChatGPT censors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's not clear to me is if DeepSeek and other Chinese models are...a) censored at output by a separate processb) explicitly trained to not output "sensitive" contentc) implicitly trained to not output "sensitive" content by the fact that it uses censored content, and/or content that references censoring in training, or selectively chooses training contentI would assume most models are a combination. As others have pointed out, it seems you get different results with local models implying that (a) is a factor for hosted models.The thing is, censoring by hosts is always going to be a thing. OpenAI already do this, because someone lodges a legal complaint, and they decide the easiest thing to do is just censor output, and honestly I don't have a problem with it, especially when the model is open (source/weight) and users can run it themselves.More interesting I think is whether trained censoring is implicit or explicit. I'd bet there's a lot more uncensored training material in some languages than in others. It might be quite hard to not implicitly train a model to censor itself. Maybe that's not even a problem, humans already censor themselves in that we decide not to say things that we think could be upsetting or cause problems in some circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858552</guid></item><item><title>29.

But studying what happens to a corpse between death and discovery is quite challenging, and I'm impressed that they devised a suitable experiment and were able to carry it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of lesser known Lem's novel:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Investigation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This type of research is necessary if we want to do forensic pathology. Location affects fauna involved. And also weather and seasons affects how it progresses. One example I read was that different insects are present at different stages. So based on their cycles you can narrow down time of death somewhat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832742</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The compute scheduling part of the paper is also vey good, the way they balanced load to keep compute and communication in check.There is also a lot of thought put into all the tiny bits of optimization to reduce memory usage, using FP8 effectively without significant loss of precision nor dynamic range.None of the techniques by themselves are really mind blowing, but the whole of it is very well done.The DeepSeekV3 paper is really a good read: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSee...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is it that the larger models are better at understanding and following more and more complex instructions. And generally just smarter?With DeepSeek we can now run on non-GPU servers with a lot of RAM. But surely quite a lot of the 671 GB or whatever is knowledge that is usually irrelevant?I guess what I sort of am thinking of is something like a model that comes with its own built in vector db and search as part of every inference cycle or something.But I know that there is something about the larger models that is required for really intelligent responses. Or at least that is what it seems because smaller models are just not as smart.If we could figure out how to change it so that you would rarely need to update the background knowledge during inference and most of that could live on disk, that would make this dramatically more economical.Maybe a model could have retrieval built in, and trained on reducing the number of retrievals the longer the context is. Or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;none of these techniques except MLA are new&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855170</guid></item><item><title>31.

I had to keep track of the position all the time and there are no constraints.Compared to that I tried Onshape (the free version which is almost the full one but all models are public) and it took me an afternoon to create my pieces.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of transitive dependencies in software development and their potential benefits, such as reducing redundant code and simplifying dependency management. It explores the challenges posed by these dependencies on security, particularly in terms of vulnerabilities introduced by third-party libraries. The author argues for a balanced approach that retains the advantages of transitive dependencies while implementing strategies to mitigate security risks, including better monitoring and management practices. The piece emphasizes the need for developers to be aware of the trade-offs and to adopt secure coding practices that do not compromise the benefits of using transitive dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anything is going to put capabilities into the programmer ecosystem, I think it's this problem.The neat thing about this particular problem is that you can do some really coarse things and get some immediate benefit. Capabilities in their original form, and perhaps their truest form, carry down the call stack, so that code can do things like "restrict everything that I call can only append to files in this specific subtree" in the most sophisticated implementations. But you could do something more coarse with libraries and just do things like "These libraries can not access the network", and get big wins on some simple assertions. If you're a library for turning jpegs into their pixels, you don't need network access, and with only a bit more work, you shouldn't even need filesystem access (get passed in files if you need them, but no ability to spontaneously create files).This would not be a complete solution, or perhaps even an adequate solution, but it would be a great bang-for-the-buck solution, and a great way to step into that world and immediately get benefits without requiring the entire world to immediately rewrite everything to use granular capabilities everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm bit surprised that browsers did not get a mention here. They are one of the big examples of how an application can be split into gazillion small processes, split along trust boundaries, while also being pretty performance sensitive applications.As for transitive deps, I have some hopes for more "distro" like models to arise. In particular I see clear parallels in how traditional Linux distros work and how large faang style monorepos work. So maybe we could see more these sort of platforms/collections of curated libraries that avoid these deep transitive dep trees by hoisting all the deps into one cohesive global dependency that has at least some more eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Side note, I think the serde yaml debacle was so predictable. As much as I admire Dtolnay his choice to archive the repository and push a deprecated version on cargo made everybody scramble for an alternative "maintained" crate is on him. You can say whatever you want about checkbox security but most people still have to deal with it if only to make the tooling shut up so they can do their work.Maybe the rust fondation should take over more of those fundamental crates when maintainers are not willing or able to continue working on them. A similar problem happened with the zip crate which was transferred rather fast to a new maintainer and most people still use a very old version pre-transfer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857532</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a cheapy Samsung curved 27inch 1080p monitor that use to live in a tax office. It didn't work so it was given to me to see if I could fix it. I noticed I couldn't plug in an HDMI cable without the back of the monitor popping the cable out of it's socket. The only way to get the HDMI cable to plug in all the way was to angle the monitor down at the table. If I try to face it up, the bezel tents out and pushes the cable out of socket.I put the monitor in a corner and left it for around a year. A year later I get another similar monitor with a broken OSD nipple like the one in this article. I noticed that it had no problem with cables being pushed out of socket. I looked at the back of the monitor and saw that there's a little screw just above the inputs on the back of the new monitor.So I snag the screw from the new, broken monitor and try to screw it in to the old 'working' monitor in hopes that it would fix the shell, and it won't screw in. WTF right? Same monitor, same model.. No screw hole but there was a place for a screw, just no hole. 
So I pull the bezel up enough to notice that there actually IS a threaded screw hole behind the shell, there's just no hole in the back for the screw to go in. So I break out a drill, make my own hole and the screw screws right in. Perfectly fixed.First time I ever fixed a monitor with a drill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For something like this, I feel like the work to investigate the guts of the switch mechanism was overkill. I'd rather desolder it wholly, and try to find some component to replace it with. I have little faith in non-break-itude of teeny things when handled slightly incorrectly.That being said, I once replaced the thumbsticks on an X360 controller due to stick drift. It was very fun to destructively open up the old mechanisms and see how they worked.I also operate my sit/stand desk with a pair of tweezers, by shorting some pins on a breakout board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have the same control doodad on my LG monitor. Not only does it apparently fail quite often, it sucks entirely to begin with and is an incredible regression in ergonomics and human interface. So stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828848</guid></item><item><title>34.

I had to use fallen spruce branches to steady myself with each step on the way down. It was like walking on little brooms. It did the job well enough for a southern California native.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you go onto running track that is covered in ice in January, you get to really appreciate those middle distance spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42815697</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of Keycloak for authentication in Angular applications, focusing on the Backend for Frontend (BFF) architectural pattern. It emphasizes how the BFF pattern simplifies communication between the frontend and various backend services by providing a dedicated backend that serves the needs of the frontend. The author outlines the steps to set up Keycloak with Angular, including the configuration of Keycloak, managing authentication tokens, and handling user sessions. Additionally, the article highlights the benefits of using the BFF pattern, such as improved security and streamlined API consumption, making it a valuable reference for developers looking to enhance their Angular applications with robust authentication solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand the benefit of adding this intermediate component vs just writing frontend code to interact with the APIs you’d otherwise already be calling. An HTTP server with sessions placed between clients and internal systems makes sense and is standard, but the weird callback-style “remote control” system seems completely unnecessary and inefficient to me. I don’t think client logic being married to some backend vs the client itself makes any real guarantees about functionality being maintained either, it just adds a new location where code needs to be changed when something upstream changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The BFF pattern is just "mostly microservices dedicated to a particular client type".It makes sense when you have drastically different needs between a desktop client and a mobile client (or maybe for a kiosk client or POS interface)Hosting a microservice is cheap, it avoids unnecessary workload on backend data stores, and teams can operate with more autonomy if they don't have to cooperatively update APIs in coordination with other groups with differing priorities.This article really just reads like "I figured out how to do authentication with keycloak using OIDC"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formally proving that you can't be authenticated to a service without actually holding some type of authentication token is trivial.Whatever you replace it with (a short-lived access token, a session cookie, a JWT, or whatever else) becomes the authentication token — if you add other properties (like short expiry), you are mostly trading convenience for security (eg. people will get logged out, or you'll need to implement refresh token dance in your app).So it's really confusing to me how can someone pretend that there is something you can do on the unsafe client side, because you really can't (sure, there are obvious things you shouldn't do, like keep a plain text password in a cookie or localStorage, but an auth token is pretty much the same thing other than expiry).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829315</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Slicing the Fourth" explores the concept of higher dimensions in physics, focusing on the idea of the fourth spatial dimension and how it can be conceptualized. It discusses various models and theories that attempt to explain the nature of the fourth dimension, including its implications for understanding the universe and the limitations of human perception when grappling with multidimensional spaces. The article aims to demystify these complex ideas and encourages readers to think beyond the traditional three-dimensional framework, ultimately providing insights into how higher dimensions could influence our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

Two major things happened in 2022 that everyone knew would cause this if they stuck around:* The Section 174 changes went into effect, requiring all software to be expensed as R&amp;D, which means it can't be deducted from profits directly and instead has to be amortized over 5 years [0].* Interest rates went back up starting in Feb 2022 and continuing through Aug 2023. This chart [1] is a near-perfect mirror of the job trends.I know this doesn't help anyone who's struggling right now, but it does serve to emphasize that this didn't just happen, and it wasn't the result of technological advances making us obsolete. Federal policy was set up to encourage an enormous amount of investment into software development, and it's now... not. Turns out politics matters.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627712[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DfOX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chart correlates well, with similar references from the US and similar related markets (see [1], [2], [3] and [4] ).At a more macro level, for the United States, I looked at U.S. unemployment data, for the last 80 years. Starting from 1945 until today Jan 2025. All jobs, not only Technology. What jumped out immediately is a clear cyclical pattern: Unemployment peaks occur, on average, every 7–8 years, with some variability.- Shorter Gaps (3–5 years) showed up in the 1950s and early 
 1960s, often tied to small recessions.- Longer Gaps (10–11 years) happened before the early 1990s 
  recession, again around the early 2000s, and more recently 
  between 2009–2010 and 2020.- Outliers include the early 1980s (double-dip recession 
  pushing unemployment above 10%) and, the 2020’s pandemic 
  spike, which briefly soared past 14%.Overall, the business cycle hasn’t radically changed over 80 years: Expansions that push unemployment down to historic lows, followed by recessions that create sharp spikes in unemployment.Assuming 7–8 years is a decent rule of thumb, and based on US history of the last 80 years, we are for a next continued peak into growing unemployment until at least 2027–2028.At a smaller scale, local trends in geopolitics, tariffs, AI adoption, and political dysfunction reflect (or confirm) the broader macro trend.Plan accordingly...And hope I am wrong...[1] Software Development Job Postings on Indeed in the United States: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE[2] Software Development Job Postings on Indeed in Canada:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love love love Svelte/Sveltekit. I am an experienced backend engineer and this is the first time I have worked in a FE framework that just clicked.What I like:- Not a whole lot of magic syntax.- The structure of files feels like I am building a backend app, its quite logical and easy to parse through.- Easy to get up and running, I am sure the decisions exist but I struggle historically with all the sidecar products that can be added into the frontend framework.- It combines the beauty of native JS/TS with svelte. I can hydrate a store with my own hand rolled api calls.- There is not a whole lot going on from a API/user perspective. I have stores and routes which are built into the folder structure. I am sure there is more but that gets me to a useful MVP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been using Svelte for several years, but haven’t had much time to dive into the many changes in 5.Maybe someone here can shed light on something about runes that feels very off to me. The rune is on the wrong side of the equal sign? Like:  let counter = $state(0);

Looks like a reactive value assigned to a variable, but that’s not at all what’s going on. It’s actually a reactive variable initialized to 0. So, for example, despite what you’d expect you can’t even move the $state call into a utility function if you’d have some reason to. Very counterintuitive to me, and not really touched upon in the docs as far as I’ve seen, but I have to assume there’s some practical reason why they did it this way.I remember Svelte 2 (or 1? Can’t remember) had some weird things like this as well, where you’d think you could do something based on your experience from JavaScript but it just wasn’t supported. The label syntax in Svelte 3 was pretty brilliant because it was a clear indication that you shouldn’t expect normal JS rules to apply. It did have other problems that they appear to have fixed though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved svelte. But svelte5 seems to be a bit of  turn off. It's not even the runes. Slots was hands down the best feature of svelte. And they deprecated it I still can't for the life of me figure out how the new way is supposed to work. The migration docs are very limited. And it's super weird that the parent has to intentionally render children instead of a slots? 
Also, why deprecate the on:event syntax?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857106</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in Sweden and am totally not aware of this trend.However what is not mentioned is that "summer homes" are quite common in Sweden, usually a little cabin somewhere further out from the city that a person or family owns.In my case my girlfriends family shares a house on the coast in Smålland, which even has functioning power and water (rare among these types of vacation homes).I think being able to get away from the noise of the city makes city living significantly more tolerable, I nearly lost my mind when I lived in London for 4 years because anywhere remotely affordable was just loud, and you always felt like you were under someones feet.Taking time away from the noise to get a proper uninterrupted nights rest makes a lot of sense, but I think you also need the reprieve of having personal space. Not that any city in Sweden is even remotely close to the noise levels or population density of a city like London, especially in the parts I could afford to live.This article feels a little bit like lifestyle porn, in that very few people are actually doing this, and it sounds exotic ("just like the scandinavians!") but the reality is actually better than what's depicted and less 1-dimensional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes... spending thousands of $/€ to go somewhere and then focus on sleeping as long as possible instead of  sightseeing, sampling the local cuisine and other stuff regular tourists do, sounds like the ultimate luxury indeed! Because it shows that you have not only the money, but also the free time to travel somewhere just to sleep there - something that a person who can maybe afford the same vacation, but has a limited number of vacation days, won't even consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool to see this here!I bought a house in Nyland [1] a few years ago and now I'm turning it into a place to retreat to for focus time / being close to nature.If someone is interested in sharing the space over a longer period of time (as I'm not living in Sweden), hit me up (email on my profile)[1] https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ww1GHL5rFXdkcdHfA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828966</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone explain the appeal of cramming what is effectively a GUI into a terminal? This sort of thing has always been popular around here, but I never saw the appeal. The main benefits appear to be usage over SSH, and a certain obscure style due to running in a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll very likely never use this because web and android apps are just too comfortably but I've thoroughly enjoyed seeing the level of detail, quality and options available there.One question (and apologies if it was on the documentation), but is it possible to automate to download and archive series for later watching without internet? This is my number #1 usage scenario, mostly getting the fresh chapters and have them locally because they disappear from the URL after some time or I might want to just watch while travelling without internet somewhere.Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just skimming the README, is there actually something inherently special about anime? Or is there some quasi-standard format how you acquire them these days (maybe something with subtitles?) - I think the last anime I played on a computer was still DivX ;)I see mpv, so it's basically a file browser for movie files?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828459</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Linux ultimately prevailed-not because it was better from the start, but because it allowed developers to modify the code freely, run it more securely and affordably, and build a broader ecosystem that enabled more capabilities than any closed system"Deepseek followed llama and will be followed by others in the usual mushroom fashion of open source. People really dont appreciate the magnitude of the disruptive force that is unleashed by the open source paradigm. In a year from now the landscape will be brimming with new initiatives. In a few years nobody will even remember "open"ai.Conventional economic theory will always misread the future of computing (and thus "AI"). The zero marginal cost and infinite replicability is not a bug, its a feature. But so far we dont really have a good model how to think about it and merge it with mainstream business models. Something must pay the bills eventually but these are very different bills from those of conventional scarcity based businesses. Ironically in the end the main scarcity is human ingenuity. Read the interview of the Deepseek founder on why their models are open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeepSeek has demonstrated that there is no technical moat. Model training costs are plummeting, and the margins for APIs will just get slimmer. Plus model capabilities are plateauing. Once model improvement slows down enough, seems to me like the battle is to be fought in the application layer. Whoever can make the killer app will capture the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just playing devil's advocate:VCs (esp those who missed out on OAI) are heavily incentivized to root for OAI to fail, and commoditize the biggest COGs item (AI models).This guy is just talking his book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42847825</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow-up question: what work has been done on client-side moderation? I know this gets dangerously close to the kind of content scanning that eg apple has tried (to very detrimental results), but hear me out: I really think this is a prerequisite to end-to-end encryption on a social network (there has to be some level of protection; even if 100% of users report 100% of bad content, imagine scrolling a feed and stumbling upon CSAM simply because you were the first person to see it). I also also think it's possible to strike a balance that preserves user agency while still protecting them, by simply inserting a manual reporting step. So, for example, potentially problematic content gets put behind an interstitial with a content warning and options to view, hide, report, etc. But again, this requires client-side content classification.I'm aware of eg NSFWJS, which is a tensorflowJS model [1]. Is there anything else that, say, can also do violence/gore detection?[1] https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is a static site hosting platform required to proactively monitor which content paying users host in your jurisdiction?Wouldn't a solid set of processes to handle content complaints and knowing who your customers are in case the hosting country's law enforcement has a case suffice?Or are you having some free tier where users can anonymously upload stuff?In the latter case — a free place to stash megabytes — you'll need to detect password protected archives in addition to unencrypted content. Get ready for a perpetual game of whack-a-mole though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you care about moderation, a lot of it has to be done manually. Manual moderation requires placing a high level of trust in the moderators. That means that either you pay them well enough to care, or you build a community which user-moderators will protect. Or both.That makes approximately all business ideas to host user generated content non-viable. The conflict is dynamic and you are the Maginot Line...except that any breach of laws creates a potential attack by state enforcement agencies too.To put it another way, ASCII files and a teletype were enough to see pictures of naked ladies. Good luck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830018</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love Sublime Text. It's one of my favorite pieces of software. I have it running 100% of the time on every machine I work on.It's where I write all of my personal notes, blog posts, and it's where I wrote both "Game Programming Patterns" and "Crafting Interpreters".At the same time, it's not the tool I use as an IDE. For programming, I use whatever IDE is dominant for the language I'm working in. Over time, that's been Visual C++, Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and most recently VS Code.That doesn't mean to me that I want Sublime to turn into an IDE. I like that it's lighterweight than that. It's the perfect sweet spot for me of rich enough to handle piles of notes and documents and small scale code editing, but not so huge and cumbersome that it gets in my way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text developer here, thank you for all the praise! I'm looking forward to what we can accomplish this year. If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So glad to see this. I have been down a long road of text editors:- Sublime
- Vim
- Emacs
- Atom
- VSCode
- Jetbrains IDE
- Neovim
- Zed
- CursorAnd these aren’t just little flings. I’ve spent months if not years in most of these editors. However, at the end of the day I always come back to one: Sublime.It is a beautiful piece of software. It feels like writing with one’s “good pen and good paper”, that high quality stationary sort of thing. It is just me and the code. There is something that just feels different or even tactile about Sublime. That actually leads me to ask as this is outside of my expertise: why does Sublime feel more tactile/real than other editors? When I look at the code in other editors it feels like I’m looking at a projector on a wall. When I look at the code in Sublime it feels like I’m looking at something painted on the wall. Anybody else have the same experience? What’s the psychological/software reason for that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862246</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; But now with reasoning systems and verifiers, we can create brand new legitimate data to train on. This can either be done offline where the developer pays to create the data or at inference time where the end user pays!&gt; This is a fascinating shift in economics and suggests there could be a runaway power concentrating moment for AI system developers who have the largest number of paying customers. Those customers are footing the bill to create new high quality data … which improves the model … which becomes better and more preferred by users … you get the idea.While I think this is an interesting hypothesis, I'm skeptical. You might be lowering the cost of your training corpus by a few million dollars, but I highly doubt you are getting novel, high quality data.We are currently in a world where SOTA base model seems to be capped at around GPT4o levels. I have no doubt that in 2-3 years our base models will compete with o1 or even o3... just it remains to be seen what innovations/optimizations get us there.The most promising idea is to use reasoning models to generate data, and then train our non-reasoning models with the reasoning-embedded data. But... it remains to be seen how much of the chain of thought reasoning you can really capture into model weights. I'm guessing some, but I wonder if there is a cap to multi-head attention architecture. If reasoning can be transferred from reasoning models to base models, OpenAI should have already trained a new model with o3 training data, right?Another thought is maybe we don't need to improve our base models much. It's sufficient to have them be generalists, and to improve reasoning models (lowering price, improving quality) going forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The o3 system demonstrates the first practical, general implementation of a computer adapting to novel unseen problems"Yet, they said when it was announced:"OpenAI shared they trained the o3 we tested on 75% of the Public Training set. They have not shared more details. We have not yet tested the ARC-untrained model to understand how much of the performance is due to ARC-AGI data."These two statements are completely opposed. I can't take seriously anything this article says about o3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The claim is that this removes the human bottleneck (aka SFT or supervised fine tuning) on domains with a verifiable reward. Critically, this verifiable reward is extremely hard to pin down in nearly all domains besides mathematics and computer science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868390</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses allegations that DeepSeek, a data collection service, may have unlawfully obtained vast amounts of data that OpenAI previously utilized for training its models. It explores the implications of these claims, including potential legal ramifications and the ethical considerations surrounding data sourcing for AI development.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains OAuth 2.0, a widely-used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts without sharing passwords. It outlines how OAuth 2.0 works, emphasizing the roles of the resource owner, client application, authorization server, and resource server. The piece details the different grant types—such as authorization code, implicit, password, and client credentials—each catering to different application needs. It also highlights the importance of OAuth 2.0 in enhancing security and user experience by allowing users to grant permissions selectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love reading blog posts on oauth2 and oidc. I have a mental model on how it works but every person has their own way to describe the flows. So far my favorite article has been oauth-oidc from first principles[1] and why each piece of the protocol is useful.This being hackernews, any comment worthwhile cannot be devoid of criticism. Trust-on-first-use is used incorrectly here -- saving the previous authorization scopes is just caching. TOFU has a specific definition in security: it's when you're establishing a secure channel but you haven't shared a secret or public key a-priori -- it makes it impossible to guarantee that the counter-party is whom they say they are. Very concretely TOFU is a diffie hellman key exchange with a shared secret that can be MitMed. Through use in time the shared secret gains integrity because the probability of a persistent MitM accross channels degrades. The most common place TOFU is encountered is when connecting via ssh to a server and the server accepts your connection because you're in their authorized_keys but the server's key is not in your known_hosts.[1] https://stack-auth.com/blog/oauth-from-first-principles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an Oauth2 hater, I consider this protocol cursed, mainly due to how hard it is to read through all the specs and have a useful understanding of what one should do with it. Reading the OIDC spec, where they define authN in terms of authZ, lets me experience what a stroke must feel like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a non-web person, I find everything related to this auth business needlessly complicated and arbitrarily limited. Most of the time it's not even implemented correctly anyway (many application not checking the JWT audience...) because web devs just use libraries without understand what actually provides the security.As an application writer, I want the user to feed me a token signed by a trusted entity that proves he is who he claims he is and has the necessary accesses enabled for my application.Whether this happens transparently via a redirect to the trusted entity login webpage and back to my app or whether I request the user to go to a specific url on their own while I wait for them to do so is just an UX detail. Why every approach needs to be labeled a "flow", authorized separately, and come with their own limitations is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42829149</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of composable SQL, highlighting its advantages in building flexible and maintainable data processing systems. It emphasizes how composable SQL allows developers to combine different SQL queries modularly, enabling easier adjustments and integrations over traditional monolithic SQL structures. The piece also explores practical applications, its compatibility with existing SQL databases, and the potential for enhancing data workflows and analytics. Overall, the article advocates for adopting composable SQL as a modern approach to handling complex data operations effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828883"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:&gt; What you hope happens is that Postgres will recursively inline every view, merge them all together into a gigaquery, and shuffle the predicates up and down to maximally optimize the query. That was the conceit. And of course that never happens.The author seems to be describing a Progress-specific problem. Oracle, SQL Server (and probably other "enterprise" databases as well) are pretty good at inlining views and then optimizing the whole resulting gigaquery as if the views were not there in the first place.&gt; The central problem is that views have to be written for the general case, and then you filter on the view’s output. Views can’t take parameters.SQL Server supports inline table-valued functions, which are exactly that - parametrized and inlinable views.Unfortunately, they are not as composable as they could be. For example, a function returning table and a function accepting the same type of a table as input cannot be directly composed - you'd first need to store the first function's result in a temporary table or table variable. But despite the limitations, functions are extremely useful for constructing complex queries which reuse logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how CTEs are efficiency minefields and how Postgres doesn't do a good job of pushing down predicates, for example.TBH, the solution is to improve the Postgres engine in this regard?For example, in Bigquery I often use CTEs and see predictable speedups that are explained by predicate pushdown when slapping a WHERE clause on the user of a CTE etc.  Bigquery has plenty of performance gotchas but I don't think CTEs are one of them; they seem to be transparent to the optimiser.Something else that Bigquery supports is user-defined 'table' functions.  These are like the 'functors' the article creates.However, in practice they aren't very widely used, and I think this hints that they aren't as useful as the article is hoping for.The thing I _really_ want is scoping.  If only functions could be described like CTE WITH blocks, e.g.   WITH visits AS (
      SELECT ...
      FROM web_logs
      WHERE ...
   ),
   foo(bar INT, baz STRING) AS (
      ... function body here
   )
   SELECT ..., foo(a, b), ...
   FROM visits
   WHERE ...

Apart from the tidiness of this, this allows inlining of functions into the SQL statement body rather than as separate statements.  Often various tooling e.g. DBT makes it really hard to with separate function definitions etc, and being able to inline logic would make things possible.Bigquery also supports user-defined aggregate functions.  Although there is rarely the need to stray from the standard builtin aggregate functions, when you need them they are brilliant.(Anyone working _on_ Bigquery reading?  If so, please ping me, I have loads of feedback on what works well and where the user pain and toil is ;) )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on a project that does tons of SQL based data transformations (thousands). A lot of it isn't backed by unit tests. Some of our people with more of a C++ background have got the idea that this is crazy, every bit of business logic should be encapsulated into a function just like in every other civilized language, so that it could be unit tested. They built a framework like this for SQL and implemented quite a few jobs with it.The problem is most of the SQL-first devs hate it and would rather write untested code, or rely on alternative test automation techniques like bringing up a local DB instance with fake data, than have to refit their business logic into pure functions. The truth is that it's just not a way of working that comes naturally to people who write a lot of SQL for a living.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828883</guid></item><item><title>7.

It’s hard to say why it worked — my friends assume that the microbiome is implicated because of the dietary change. Plausible, but hardly a proof. This gives me at least one direction to look in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a "you don't know what you don't know" thing. This article lays out a path way for a link between a chemical that is common in our lives and depression. That pathway is a common gut bacteria. The article ends with this:"So taken together, there would seem to be good reason to continue to unravel the long-hypothesized inflammation/depression connection, and particularly in regards to possible exacerbating factors such as higher levels of M. morganii infection or even higher environmental exposure to diethanolamine. We seem to have a lot to learn here!"diethanolamine is commonly used in liquid laundry and dish washing detergents, cosmetics, shampoos and hair conditioners. So you really don't know if your hair conditioner, shampoo or dish washing detergent is causing you inflammation &amp; depression. Hmmm.We, as in the institutions that supposedly protect consumers, work on the assumption that anything can be used and added until it is proven not safe. For example, thalidomide. We did not know it would cause deformed babies, so it was assumed to be safe.Okay, so will some corporation knowingly use something that is hazardous, just to make more money. Well we have the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma. Or you can go watch "Erin Brokovitch". And you might want to watch Matix again just for fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42863262</guid></item><item><title>8.

Is there usually a translation step involved? Or do devs around the world just have to bite the bullet and learn enough English to be able to use the majority of tools?I'm realizing now that I'm very ignorant when it comes to non English-based software engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you everyone, this was responsibly disclosed to DeepSeek and published after the issue was remediated, we got acknowledgment from their team today on our contribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you imagine executing arbitrary SQL queries via your web browser? :DComplete database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment without ANY authentication...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871371</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat, I love projects like these.The next level down is to do it directly in numpy.And then from there, write a minimal numpy work-a-like to support the model above.You start with a working system using the most powerful abstractions. Then you iteratively remove abstractions, lowering your solution, then when you get low enough but still riding on an external abstraction, you rewrite that, but ONLY to support the layers above you.Following the above pattern, you can bootstrap yourself to have full system understanding. This is not unlike RL+distillation that human persons do learn complex topics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;github has a bunch of them for years, the most known from Andrej Karpathy:https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPTsome other have MoE implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a google collab notebook built from this. It takes ~2 hours on A100 GPU if you have collab pro.

They are so automated that they also create staff members and fake profiles on LinkedIn, specifically for that spam effort. Nobody at LinkedIn gives a shit about those fake avatars, I reported hundreds by now and they did absolutely nothing.Anyways, long story short, here's the blocklist of those ASNs and companies. I'm working on the map at the moment and don't wanna publish it until I can prove its correctness:[1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in the US Navy, I learned most of the time, the weak points in security were usually people. Attackers know this and exploit it. And it usually wasn't movie plot style "do this or your wife gets it" exploits. Those seemed to get blown up easily. It was mundane things. Distracting a watch stander with something that was actually stupid. Making someone late for duty. Putting something really gross in the garbage hoping the inspector would skip that bag. So many little lapses in human judgement. Most completely innocent. This was with vigilant, uniformed people subject to military discipline, and those thing happened.So you have to focus on process and systems. Some easy stuff:* Never ask customers/employees for a password. If someone does it's a scam.* Refund money only to the payment method used to pay for the product/service.* 2FA is your friend no matter how much the VP of Sales whines about it.* have a way to expire tokens and force reset of passwords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  People connecting through our VPN have access to an internal-only SMTP gateway machine that doesn't require SMTP authentication.Time to clean that up while you're at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862873</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The Sentry risk assessment system provides detailed information about the potential risks of near-Earth objects (NEOs), specifically focusing on object 2024 YR4. The page outlines the object's characteristics, its trajectory, the likelihood of impact with Earth, and any observational data available. It assesses potential impact scenarios and highlights ongoing monitoring efforts by NASA to track NEOs that may pose a threat to our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on the Near Earth Object Surveyor space telescope (NEO Surveyor) writing simulation code which predicts which objects we will see. 
This one has drummed up a bit of interest due to its (relatively) high chance of impact. I actually spent quite a bit of time yesterday digging through archive images trying trying to see if it was spotted on some previous times it came by the Earth (no luck unfortunately). Since we saw it so briefly, our knowledge of its orbit is not that great, and running the clock back to 2016 for example ended up with a large chunk of sky where it could have been, and it is quite small. We will almost certainly see it again with NEO Surveyor years before its 2032 close encounter. I have not run a simulation for it, but I would not be surprised if LSST (a large ground telescope survey which is currently coming online) to catch it around the same time NEO Surveyor does.Our knowledge of the diameter of this object is a bit fuzzy, because of surface reflectivity, small shiny things can appear as bright as dark large things. This is one of the motivations of making the NEO Surveyor an IR telescope, since IR we see black body emission off of the objects, which is mostly size dependent, and only weakly albedo dependent.There is an even tinier chance that if it misses the Earth in 2032, it could hit the moon. I haven't run the numbers precisely for that one, but it impacted a few times in some monte-carlo simulations.If anyone is interested in orbit dynamics, I have open sourced some of the engine we are using for observation predictions: https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/keteIt is relatively high precision, though JPL Horizons has more accurate gravitational models and is far better suited for impact studies. My code is primarily for predicting when objects will be seen in telescopes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not an increase over baseline risk (as its Palermo scale[0] indicates, being a negative number, -0.56).I think there's going to be a crisis of media going forwards, because with the very awesome new telescope[1] that's going online this year, the number of these detections is going to drastically go up. The number of objects isn't going up—they've always been there, we just didn't know—but I think the media coverage is not going to absorb that nuance very well.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo_Technical_Impact_Hazar... ("A rating of 0 means the hazard is equivalent to the background hazard (defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact)")[1] https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/01/1108643/vera-c-r... ("With its capacity to detect faint objects, [Vera] Rubin is expected to increase the number of known asteroids and comets by a factor of 10 to 100")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working link: https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=2024%20Y...8.1 megatons of kinetic energy.

&lt;p&gt;The website showcases a coding course created by Jimmy H. Miller, focusing on teaching the fundamentals of programming through interactive projects and hands-on exercises. It emphasizes the importance of discovery-based learning, encouraging students to explore coding concepts while creating their own projects. The course aims to build a strong foundation in coding skills, suitable for beginners and those looking to enhance their knowledge in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860128"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone said on HN a while back that this sort of approach is the most sensible, because any design doc is just an incomplete abstraction until you get in the weeds to see where all the tricky parts are. Programming is literally writing plans for a computer to do a thing, so writing a document about everything you need to write the plan is an exercise in frustration. And if you DO spend a lot of time making a perfect document, you've put in far more work than simply hacking around a bit to explore the problem space. Because only by fully exploring a problem can you confidently estimate how long it will take to write the real code. Often times after the first draft I just need to clean things up a bit or only half complete a bad solution before improving it. Yes, there are times you need to sit and have a think first, but less often than you might imagine.Of course, at a certain scale and team size a tedious document IS the fastest way to do things... but god help you if you work on a shared code base like that.I've always thought the rigid TDD approach and similar anti-coding styles really lend themselves to people that would rather not be programming. Or at least have a touch of the OCD and can't stand to not have a unit test for every line of code. Because it really is a lot more work both up front and in maintenance to live that way.Cyber-paper is cheap, so don't be afraid to write some extra lines on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's a dangerous philosophy for professional work. You know what happens to code that works? It ships.If you code out a solution to the problem in order to discover the problem space, I think the idea here is that you then can go back and write a better solution that accounts for all of the stuff you discovered via refactoring and whatnot. But you're not going to do that refactoring. You're going to ship it. Because it works and you don't know of any problems with it. Are there scaling problems? Probably, you haven't run into any yet. Does your solution fit whatever requirements other interested parties might have? Who knows! We didn't do any designing or thinking about the problem yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am an avid discovery coder and was actually day dreaming an outline for a similar article on my way home on the bus today. I think this is an extremely important concept at all levels of engineering and something we all need to adopt at one point or another in our careers / practice.I think it follows a few topics, "the art of the POC/Spike" or just exploratory coding. These things give us a tangible hands on approach for understanding the codebase, and I think lend to better empathy and understanding of a software system and less rash criticisms of projects that may be unfamiliar.This is particularly relevant to me right now as I am discovery coding a fairly large project at my company and working with product to lay out design and project planning. Whats difficult to express from my current standing is how the early stages of these types of projects are more milestone / broad based rather than isolated small key pieces. Sure I can spend a week delivering design, architecture, epic, outline docs for all the known and unknown features of the project (and I am). But at the same time I need to discover and test out base case / happy path solutions to the core business problem to more accurately understand the scope of the project.I think its something I particularly love about being a TL / IC at my company. I have the flexibility and trust to "figure it out" and the working arrangement to provide adequate professional documentation at the appropriate time. I am fortunate to have that buy in from leadership and certainly recognize it as a unique situation.All that being said:1. Learn how to effectively isolate and run arbitrary parts of your system for YOUR understanding and learning
2. Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
3. Learn to summarize and document your findings in a suitable fashion for your situation
4. Encourage this throughout your team. Useful in all aspects from bug triage to greenfield work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860128</guid></item><item><title>13.

Guide research?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHIME is great because it is so cheap. It's parabolic cylinders lying on the ground pointing fixedly straight up. The construction and mantainence cost per meter^2 of effective aperture is the lowest it possibly can be. It's basically a handful of large "half pipe" looking things next to shipping containers packed full of GPUs and power equipment. The only downside to this parabolic cylinder design is reflections down the long axis of the cylinder but that can be mitigated.It's a (nearly) filled aperture with lots of redundant baselines which allows for easier calibration and seeing through the galactic foreground. But being so (relatively) closely spaced it's resolution is limited. Adding outriggers fixes this for when they want to get a position and I'd bet they put one at angles to the main array cylinder direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42854887</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow! This is some phenomenal engineering!&gt; Another area that stumped me is how to shut the power off 100% on the device, so that it can remain “off” for weeks or months.This is actually a pretty solvable problem...https://circuitcellar.com/resources/quickbits/soft-latching-...Then the microcontroller can choose at any time to completely shut off the entire circuit (including itself), and extremely little power will be consumed until something (like a button) completes the power-on circuit again.For ease of prototyping, there are off-the-shelf units you can play with: https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-soft-power-switch-jst-2mm....Some more advanced soft power switch circuits (like the SparkFun switch) also include the ability to forcibly power down a misbehaving device by holding down the button.The design used in the SparkFun switch also allows your microcontroller to know if the button is pushed while the device is running, so you could imagine repurposing your existing button to also restore power to the device if the device is off, and still retain the existing functionality for cycling through watch faces. Then, either the device could automatically shut itself off after a period of inactivity or when the battery gets too low, or the user could click and hold the button for some number of seconds to turn the device off completely that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all -- awesome!Second, if you aren't aware or in case others are interested, the main dev from the xdrip project released a custom watch as well: https://bluejay.website/
There are some posts on reddit from the dev. (for others -- the watch is available for purchase, and allows integration w/ xdrip).Third --&gt; we've come a long way in a short time. When I was diagnosed I had to collect urine samples and drop chemical tablets in them to see how much glucose was present. And now you are building an custom solution tailored to your and your son's needs...wow. I really applaud you.Fourth --&gt; I'm hoping the new discoveries in the synthetic signaling w/ insulin will finally give us a biological solution and the tech will no longer be necessary. Here's to hoping!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of skills one has to master for a project like this is just mind-boggling, and the part about the tortilla press made me laugh out loud. A labor of love in the most literal sense!That said, I would feel pretty nervous about actually selling these, as I wouldn't be surprised if it is legally a medical device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42854291</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how ByteDance implemented eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to improve networking performance in their infrastructure. By leveraging eBPF, ByteDance was able to achieve better visibility into network traffic, enhance troubleshooting capabilities, and optimize performance metrics. The case study highlights the significant improvements in efficiency and reliability obtained through eBPF, showcasing its potential benefits for enterprises looking to enhance their network operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Netkit, which is what this is built on, is pretty neat. For transmitting packets from one container/VM to another, the conventional solution is to give each its own veth device. When you do that, the kernel network stack, at like the broad logic level, is sort of oblivious to the fact that the devices aren't real ethernet devices and don't have to go through the ethernet motions to transact.Netkit replaces that logic with a simple pairing of sending and receiving eBPF programs; it's an eBPF cut-through for packet-level networking between networks that share a host kernel. It's faster, and it's simpler to reason about; the netkit.c code is pretty easy to read straight through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see a more complete picture of ByteDance's TikTok infra. They released "KubeAdmiral" (1) so I'm assuming they're using eBPF via a Kubernetes CNI, and I see ByteDance listed on Cilium's github (2). They're also using KubeRay (3) to orchestrate huge inference tasks. It's annoying that a company I definitely do not want to work for has such an incredibly interesting infrastructure!1. https://github.com/kubewharf/kubeadmiral2. https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/USERS.md3. https://www.anyscale.com/blog/how-bytedance-scales-offline-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; eBPF is a technology that can run programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel. It is the successor to the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF, with the "e" originally meaning "extended") filtering mechanism in Linux and is also used in non-networking parts of the Linux kernel as well.&gt; It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel at runtime without requiring changes to kernel source code or loading kernel modules. Safety is provided through an in-kernel verifier which performs static code analysis and rejects programs which crash, hang or otherwise interfere with the kernel negatively.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF?useskin=vector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42866572</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a situation in Germany where customers of Seagate reported receiving hard drives that appeared to be used and resold, rather than new. These drives, sold as new products, reportedly showed signs of extensive prior use, with some having clocked tens of thousands of hours. This has raised concerns regarding consumer trust and the integrity of the product selling process, prompting an investigation into Seagate's practices and customer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864788"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can read out the FARM logs of Seagate hard drives using    smartctl -l farm /dev/sd&lt;n&gt;

They're supposed to be "more trustworthy" than the regular SMART stats.(My two "new" 16TB Exos drives had 0 hours (regular) and ~18k hours (farm) - DOM 04JUN2021 and 07JUN2021. Also, zfs refused to format the drive: 'already formatted as ddf_raid_member'.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had enough problems with new Seagate Exos drives (actually new, not remanufactured or whatever these folks ended up with,) that I've taken to buying used Western Digital Ultrastar drives on Amazon for my NAS.  They're cheaper, and so far, reliable enough.  I wrote a little more about my rationale[0], but, basically:1. With RAID-6, I can take two drive failures, and it is quicker to get a replacement off Amazon than wait for an OEM to RMA a drive under warranty2. The Ultrastars have been pretty reliable in Backblaze's published data3. The reseller I went through seems reliable enough4. There's at least some evidence these "remanufactured" drives are coming from the OEMs, and based on past experience working at a few hardware manufacturers, the no trouble found rate for RMA'd hardware is typically quite high - to the point there is likely to be nothing wrong with a product that has been returned under warranty.I guess a side benefit of this is at least I know I'm buying used drives.0 - https://marcusb.org/posts/2024/03/used-hard-drives-from-tech...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those Exos drives have been popular with homelab types because they are usually $50-$100 cheaper than prosumer drives that claim to save maybe 0.5 W and 2-3 db of noise on the datasheet.  (The latter could be effaced by a bad bearing anywhere in your build,  I haven't seen either claim tested by a review site)It's funny but in this case the enterprise product is the cheap mainstream product and the 10-20 SKUs aimed at prosumers are the exotic expensive products.  It is senseless to me that vendors like WD make special SKUs for security camera use or for 2-3 bay NAS,  4-7 bay NAS, etc when all it means is Best Buy won't stock any of them, development costs are spread out over fewer units, more versions of firmware and hardware to have bugs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864788</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those unaware, this was probably posted today because the origin of Lyme disease came up in RFK, Jr.'s Senate confirmation hearings today. He was asked if he had indeed claimed that "Lyme disease is a highly likely militarily engineered bioweapon" and he responded that he "probably did say that".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Old Lyme resident here, high school class of 82 - it was the younger siblings of my classmates who were getting "Lyme arthritis" starting in the late 70s or maybe 1980.Like most of the populated Northeast, most the area was cleared farmland or grazing land until WWI or maybe WWII - all those stone walls in the middle of the woods used to be borders between open fields. I don't think there was an ecosystem that could support Lyme disease near where people lived until maybe the 70s - the cycle needs both deer and mice, in proximity to humans to get infected, and you're not going to get either of them on open land that's grazed or under cultivation.So Lyme disease could have been around long before that, farther into the woods, and probably wouldn't have been noticed by people who had good enough doctors to figure out what was going on, or were healthy (rich?) enough for the symptoms of Lyme disease to be considered something out of the ordinary.The fact that Lyme disease exists in Europe already seemed to indicate that it's been around a very long time, but this finding adds more evidence. For that matter, I wonder if it's yet another disease that was introduced to the Americas by Europeans?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating!Living in Europe nearby, I've visited the museum multiple times in the past decade. It's one of my favorite standbys to take relatives or friends to. Can't recommend it—and Bolzano, or Bozen, depending on whether you lean Italian or German—enough!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868464</guid></item><item><title>19.

I know others are questioning the "no downtime" bit, but that is why service level objectives exist -- because it really depends on the customer experience.If you managed to have a cutover with no noticeable dip in business metrics (aka the users didn't notice) then I'd call that a no-downtime upgrade!Very clever on the improvement over Lyft's methods.  Thanks for the writeup.  Now maybe someone can get it down from 3 seconds of pausing. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause all writes &gt; let 16 to catch up &gt; resume writes on 16Isn’t that….. downtime?

Meaning that your SACD rips in DSD format are not transcoded. Plex cannot do that, neither can any subsonic server or jellyfin.You need a native player for this, but it is doable. Mpv at least can play the files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks very nice, however it doesn't seem to support subsonic yet, which means no Android Auto integration through Ultrasonic.I'm going to keep watch on this, there aren't many music players with interfaces that look that nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How's the support for the Album Artist tag? This is a common paint point I have with every single self-hosted solution, shockingly I've found Jellyfin to handle it the best so far.Use case: Japanese doujin (basically label compilation) albums.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42850109</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the sad realities about physical libraries is that they are dying, at least in American university systems that have been parasitized by management consulting firms.For instance, Georgia Tech recently moved their physical collection to off-campus stacks shared with Emory University, and both the University of South Carolina and Texas A&amp;M University systems are downsizing collections and moving towards an access model reliant on the ILL system. The A&amp;M system has even gone further and largely eliminated tenure for librarians. Other university systems, like the one in my snall state, have started to push checking out ebooks over physical books in various ways, possibly in preparation for more drastic changes like this, or at least so that they can begin downsizing their collectionsThis doesn't just affect students at universities, since many public institutions have historically offered community borrowing, and often have extremely rare books that simply aren't available otherwiseIt's a complicated issue since this phenomenon is driven partly by user demand -- students are reading much less than they used to, and far less in the way of physical books, and university systems are responding to changes in demand. It's still sad to see&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries.&gt;---Anne Herbert, _The Next Whole Earth Catalog_ (1980), p 331.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know someone who works at a public library in a small city. A lot of their work is "managing" homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted customers who are attracted by shelter and free computers and internet.I don't particularly have a problem with public funds going toward that, but I don't think library staff are trained or signed up for that work, or that libraries are an appropriate and cost effective way to help these people.I don't think libraries should be sacred. They're nice to look at and nostalgic, but are increasingly anachronisms. Specialized facilities for higher education and historical research I can see still having some use, perhaps small school libraries, but the average public library not so much. They use a lot of space, a lot of floor space for books, requires staffing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860240</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to efficiently parse PDFs in Elixir by leveraging Rust for performance improvements. It explains the limitations of existing Elixir libraries for PDF parsing and presents a solution that involves writing a Rust-based library that can be called from Elixir, ensuring faster processing and better resource management. The author provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the Rust library, integrating it with Elixir, and demonstrates the overall performance benefits of this approach, making it a useful resource for developers looking to enhance PDF handling in their Elixir applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been thinking a lot about how to accomplish various RAG things in Elixir (for LLM applications). PDF is one of the missing pieces, so glad to see work here. The really tricky part is not just parsing out the text (you can just call the pdftotext unix command line utility for that), but accurately pulling out things like complex tables, etc in a way that could be chunked/post processed in a useful way. I'd love to see something like Unstructured or Marker but in Rust (i.e., fast) that Elixir could NIF out to it. And maybe some kind of hybrid system that uses open llm models with vision capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Shoe Factory Principle is a concept that highlights the importance of tailored design and development processes in collaboration with end-users to ensure functionality and purpose. It critiques approaches that prioritize theoretical models over practical needs, emphasizing the value of iterative feedback and real-world applications in creating effective solutions. This principle serves as a reminder for developers and designers to engage directly with those who will use their products, ensuring that the final outcome meets actual requirements rather than abstract ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Not to me confused with the Soviet shoe factories that produced only one type and orientation of shoe - with the other half of the pair being shipped in from 500 miles away.This reminded me of something our anti-counterfeiting startup learned when integrating into manufacturing for a high-end outdoor apparel brand.There are efficiencies that the factory gets by, say, parallelizing work on the sleeves of a jacket, while other parts are also worked on.  But each batch of dyed outer material may have slight variation in color, no matter how hard they calibrate.So, their processes are designed to ensure that, when the jacket pieces come together, they all came from the same dyed batch of outer material.(There were many interesting tidbits like that, and those were just the ones relevant to us, in terms we could understand.  I'm sure the factory also knew a million other things.)Probably the Soviet shoes of TFA had worse problems than slightly mismatched color.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A similar thing I've noticed in the last ~6 years is in regards to smartphones, and in particular their cameras.Android is pretty standardized these days, and even a fairly cheap Android phone will probably do most smartphone things (make calls, send texts, watch YouTube, etc.) reasonably well, but a corner that seems to be cut in cheaper phones is almost always the camera, and that kind of makes sense.If you're buying your phone online, you can look at the more-or-less objective specs of the phone like how much RAM it has, or how fast the CPU is, but you can't really tell how the photos will look [1], and as such it's easy to put a cheaper sensor or lens in there, especially in the cheaper phones which (I think) have lower margins.[1] Even if the listing has sample pictures, you don't know how representative they are of the actual experience; they could just have taken the sample photos with ideal lighting, with a tripod, in a controlled studio, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What gets measured gets done.But, Goodhart's Law "When a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42870690</guid></item><item><title>26.

I 'member seeing this video originally on MTV at like 3AM. Instantly captivated. I'm a huge fan to this day, but there's something uniquely special about all the Phase 1 stuff: the album, the B-sides (or “G” Sides lol), the explorable Flash Kong Studios site, the DVD, Jamie Hewlett's art†, the fact that the eponymous album as originally released is 55:55 (iykyk)There's also a track on Deltron 3030 (an album I liked a lot more when it was new than I do now) which I have tagged as “feat. 2-D” instead of “feat. Damon Albarn” because come on :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxd_eDTbBMQIt's also kinda funny that 2D's entire existence is just a stupid pun on Robert Del (lol) Naja a.k.a. “3D” (a.k.a.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of programming languages, focusing on the transition from C to Clojure. It highlights how Clojure aims to combine the efficiency and performance of C with the simplicity and expressiveness of functional programming. The piece explores the advantages of Clojure, such as its emphasis on immutability and its powerful features for concurrency, while also addressing the challenges developers might face when adopting this new language. Overall, the article presents Clojure as a promising option for modern software development, appealing to those seeking to leverage the best aspects of both C and functional programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very excited for Jank, I wish the creator well.If I could make one tiny plea, it would be to focus on tooling too, and ensuring the experience for someone trying Jank out is as smooth as possible. Don't assume everyone is already set up with paredit and can fire off emacs chords without a thought. I suspect that Jank will be of particular interest to C++ programmers, many of whom are used to a very different dev paradigm.The Clojure community has done a great job at trying to smooth out the rough edges of Lisp tooling, and ensure there are on-ramps for newcomers (e.g. things like Calva for VS Code). I hope Jank keeps this up, because those first impressions really do matter. I'd hate to watch people bounce off Jank because they get stuck on trying to figure emacs out, or because they get frustrated trying to keep parentheses matched in Notepad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somehow I completely missed this. I mostly stopped using Clojure solely because of the JVM madness (yes, I know about babaskha, won’t use it due to the GraalVM dependency and possible Oracle tentacles lurking there) and have fallen back to things like Hy (which can be clunky but at least runs everywhere I have a Python interpreter). Something that has better Clojure-like syntax and uses LLVM aid very appealing, provided it can do (and serve) HTTP requests sanely and has enough batteries included.Any good pointers to existing libraries to get a feel for the ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the vision and potential evolution of a "perfect computer" by 2025. It explores the integration of advanced artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and human-computer interaction, positing that future computers will seamlessly blend into daily life, enhance cognitive capabilities, and operate with minimal human intervention. The author emphasizes the implications this advancement could have on society, including ethical considerations, job displacement, and the need for responsible development and deployment of such powerful technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That was beautiful. Nicely done, and congratulations on your restomod A1000!I’ve heard people describe it as a 16 bit computer a few times lately though and it always catches me off guard. It was usually referred to as a 32 bit computer at the time, and defensibly so.Some of its implementation details were 16 bit, like the data bus and ALU, but they were largely invisible to users and programmers. Assembly code used 32 bit math instructions, even if the CPU executed them in 2 steps. It had a flat 32 bit address space, although only 24 address lines were implemented (kind of like how not all 64 address lines are available on a 64 bit CPU today). Registers were 32 bits wide. And later 68K CPUs could run A1000 software on pure 32 bit CPUs natively with no emulation or trickery.Credit it with those extra 16 bits. It earned them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My father bought me an Amiga 1000 at a Federated Group store in late 1985.Coming from a C64, my mind was blown by the Amiga's graphics and the multi-tasking. I could run the amazing RoboCity animation demo and then drag it down half way and see my Workbench.Marble Madness on the Amiga looked and sounded just like the arcade.1985 was a magical year in general for me, but a big part of that magic was conjured by the Amiga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My career path was pretty much set in stone when I was introduced to an Amiga2000 with a Video Toaster. I watched so many different pieces of equipment get replaced by that one card inside this computer. The replaced equipment dollar value dwarfed the price of the Amiga + Toaster setup. Eventually, we upgraded the CPU from the stock 68010 to a 68040 with another expansion card which was an incredible difference.This happened the summer between my junior and senior year in high school, and I spent every day that summer learning everything about what I could do with that Toaster. By the time I graduated, I was a pretty decent technical director being able to handle the lower 3rds, camera switching, and running tape playback (and rarely used those skills later).The Amiga will always hold a special place for me. Any post like this will also keep me from doing work for longer time than it takes to read as I always go down a bit of nostalgia rabbit hole after reading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865867</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue faced by Google Pixel 4a users who find themselves stuck on an outdated and problematic firmware version due to the removal of the older firmware by Google. This has resulted in many users experiencing significant battery-related bugs and the inability to revert to a more stable version. The piece highlights user frustrations and the potential implications for device performance and usability while criticizing Google's handling of the firmware update process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, (soon to be ex) Pixel 4a user here. Regardless of why this update has happened, the way Google have went about this update is sketchy at best, and deceitful at worst. To be plain: this phone has been EOL for 1½ years now. This update has appeared out of the blue and specifically decimates the battery + charging capabilities.My most charitable view is that Google have found a major fault with the Pixel 4a battery and want to mitigate a repeat of the Galaxy Note 7 without saying it outright and causing a panic.My least charitable view (and immediate reaction) is that they're purposely ruining a viable budget phone to make more sales.Either of these are terrible. At no point has Google came out and stated -why- they're pushing this update in the first place. And as someone who hasn't updated I'd really like to know if my phone presents an immediate threat (and I'm sure Governments and airlines would also like to know) before I remotely consider an update that'll practically destroy my device.On top of this, within a day of being notified about this update, Google drastically raised the price of new Pixels on their store. Again if I'm charitable it could just be automatic global market price updates, but that goes out the window when Google must have prepared this update, FAQs, support plans, etc, then released it just before said price updates. The $100 discount recourse doesn't go far when the 8a jumped from £379 to £499. It's hard not to feel suspicious about it.While I'm here, I did briefly write about my experiences with the 4a, though I'm far from a competent tech writer: https://callmeo.live/blog/ode-to-the-pixel-4a/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm (we all are) constantly reminded to update our phones to latest available updates, but sh*t like this is what teaches users to instead disable and ignore updates indefinitely, under the premise of "if it works don't touch it" (addendum: "... because most probably an update will break it")And here I am, ignoring updates on my Pixel 6a since October 2024 (there were reports of crashes or bricking, what a surprise) and planning to keep doing that for the foreseeable future.Sucks having to choose between a potentially (even likely, seeing the trend) broken device or an unsecured one. Pick your poison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can revert this if you unlock your bootloader:https://xdaforums.com/t/undo-the-january-2025-update-without...(EDIT: Just to be clear, and which is also mentioned in that post: unlocking the bootloader will reset the device. If your device is already unlocked though, you will be able to keep the data.)Of course, I would just advise to switch to LineageOS directly, since Google has stopped providing security updates for the Pixel 4a already in August 2023. I've run LineageOS for years on the Pixel 4a and it has worked pretty much perfectly for me:https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/sunfish/Android 15 (LineageOS 22) was just released for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865619</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delicious Library was the start of a gilded age of Mac shareware focused on style over substance.&gt; In the past year or so, Mac development had shifted from applications providing new functionality that appeared at the dawn of OS X to applications (and ideas) built around flash and sizzle, with plenty of marketing hype to fuel the fire. his had created something of a toxic atmosphere in the Mac development world. A rift between the old school, with its plain but functional apps, and the new school of flashy but frivolous apps, has developed. ... I dubbed this new school “The Delicious Generation”.https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-gene...Apple adopted a similar interface for Newsstand on iOS and it seemed to be widely reviled during the pushback against skeuomorphism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Momentarily mistook this for https://del.icio.us/, but related only by name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss skeuomorphism. With good UX it makes great UI. It's weird considering I have my head inside a terminal most of the time but I was fond of those UI.I wonder if formal studies exist that measure things like "discoverbility" or productivity for normal users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860141</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article expresses the author's strong stance against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance or modify human characteristics and experiences. The writer shares personal anecdotes highlighting the value of authenticity and imperfections in life, emphasizing that AI should not attempt to "polish" or change who we are. The piece critiques the societal pressure to conform to idealized standards and advocates for embracing individuality and authenticity in a world increasingly influenced by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

The otherwise drab Adobe Reader is covered with colorful sparkly buttons and popups suggesting I need not even read the document because it can give me “insights.” First, no you may not ready my proprietary document, nor do I suspect most people using this particular software - I only have it for digital signatures - have permission to share IP with a third party. But mostly, it can sometimes be a useful tool, and the fact everyone is shoving it in my face reeks of desperation.The tech industry is in real trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obviously the AI version is bland and terrible, but arguably more importantly it has also completely changed the meaning of the message. The AI version:- apologizes- implies the recipient was "promised" this email as a "response" to something- blames a hectic schedule- invites questionsNone of this was in or was even implied in the original. This is not a "polished" version, it's just a straight-up different email. I thought that style transfer while maintaining meaning was one of the few things LLMs can be good at, but this example fails even that low bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no way in hell anyone who knows me would get that email and not think I’d been abductedThis person cares about not putting up a fake identity. That's pretty cool, but social media has exposed that a large number of people are perfectly fine presenting an illusion.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I got this really weird thing on MacOS ...I was a Windows user since like windows 3.0. With ISO German Keyboards. I never had to retrain my muscle memory to anything else, until I decided its time to buy a Macbook about 1.5 years ago.Since then I'm struggling with Karabiner to get the key mappings right.And its not just command -&gt; control to map cmd+c to ctrl+c for copy etc.It's also weird things like the ^ or the &lt;&gt; not being mapped on the right part of the keyboard. This is especially apparent (sometimes?) when I use an external keyboard (e.g. the sharkoon purewriter, but not limited to). It's a really weird issue, because on the internal mac keyboard its mapped correctly, while on the external one its not. Then I go into karabiner, select the external keyboard and remap _just for the external keyboard_ the few keys are not mapped correctly. And then weeks go by, it works, and suddenly the keyboard keys are correct without the mapping and the remapping now is the problem, so I delete them.It's not bothering enough to write an issue on karabiner. Heck, I'm even convinced its not even a karabiner issue, its something else. But I'm not deep enough into the mac system to understand where I should even look, if its even possible.If someone is using houmain to remap keys, can you maybe share a config that would map MacOS keys back Windows for someone who has a deep ingrained windows-style muscle memory? I just briefly looked through the docs, not sure if I missed it, but can houmain just remap keys for certain keyboards, but leave others unmapped?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if this will finally give a solid, cross-platform way to make the Caps Lock key work as it should: press for escape, hold for control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"cross-platform" is interesting. I've been using Keyboard Maestro on MacOS (highly recommended, it does a lot of useful stuff) and this, in combination with UHK keyboards (https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com) and their switchable keymaps, has been working well for me so far. But, getting something like Keyboard Maestro on Linux would be quite useful indeed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871040</guid></item><item><title>33.

They still had some active chapters, magazine, and academic journal that provided value for folks, but membership wasn't as valuable as it had been.They have been around a long time, and had a wider purview that WTD, focusing on many different types of technical writing. They had members in industries like Automotive, Engineering, and Aerospace, as well as Software.The best way to think about them is something like the ACM in the software industry. They have been taken over by more current community approaches in various areas (eg. Pycon), but also still doing some more traditional stuff that adds value but isn't as relevant to day-to-day practitioners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a member of an STC chapter in grad school and I went to a bunch of meetings and networking events hoping to get some practical career advice from more experienced technical writers.At no point did it feel like anyone in the org could (or would) actually help me in the transition from grad school to technical writing work. It was a really disheartening experience. It does not surprise me that membership has waned over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked as a technical writer earlier in this century and was a member of the STC for a year. In my case, that was a year too long. Like more than a few other technical writers I knew and worked with, I didn't get any value out of my membership. I got more out of the (at the time) burgeoning technical communication blogosphere than I did from the STCThe STC, at least in my view, was several steps behind the times. It was a large organization that was too slow to adapt to changing realities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867324</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The Cardan grille is a device used for encoding messages that involves a grid-like pattern with cutouts that allow certain letters or words to be visible while obscuring others. This technique is part of a broader category of steganography, where information is hidden in plain sight. The grille consists of a rectangular piece of card with strategically placed holes, and text can be revealed by placing it over written material. This method has historical significance in encryption practices and has been adapted for various forms of communication throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This would be a perfect fit for a LLM (albeit a bit complicated by byte-pair tokenization and decoder models rather than bidirectional). You can clamp the grille words, and just generate samples with those as requirements until they reach a good likelihood and are highly fluent and indistinguishable from non-message carrying text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even more impressive is the lecture of the life of Cardano himself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Cars…Cars on…Carson City.”

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an update on the development of Dart macros and their implications for data serialization. It discusses recent advancements in the Dart programming language, particularly focusing on macro functionality which allows for enhanced code generation and manipulation. The author highlights how these features can improve data serialization processes, making it easier to manage data formats and structures. Additionally, the post outlines the challenges encountered during implementation and seeks community feedback to refine these tools, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in evolving Dart's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I work on Dart and was one of the people working on this feature. Reposting my Reddit comment to provide a little context:I'm bummed that it's canceled because of the lost time, but also relieved that we decided to cancel it. I feel it was the right decision.We knew the macros feature was a big risky gamble when we took a shot at it. But looking at other languages, I saw that most started out with some simple metaprogramming feature (preprocessor macros in C/C++, declarative macros in Rust, etc.) and then later outgrew them and added more complex features (C++ template metaprogramming, procedural macros in Rust). I was hoping we could leapfrog that whole process and get to One Metaprogramming Feature to Rule Them All.Alas, it is really hard to be able to introspect on the semantics of a program while it is still being modified in a coherent way without also seriously regressing compiler performance. It's probably not impossible, but it increasingly felt like the amount of work to get there was unbounded.I'm sad we weren't able to pull it off but I'm glad that we gave it a shot. We learned a lot about the problem space and some of the hidden sharp edges.I'm looking forward to working on a few smaller more targeted features to deal with the pain points we hoped to address with macros (data classes, serialization, stateful widget class verbosity, code generation UX, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always feel better about the stewardship of a project when you see a thoughtfully written reason for saying no to a feature, especially when there’s already sunk cost. Props to the team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is good news. The dart language has been getting more complicated without corresponding quality of life improvements. A first class record object without messing around with macros would be a great start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42871867</guid></item><item><title>36.

Usable - but slow.Especially because these models &lt;think&gt; for a long bit before actually answering, so they generate for a longer period.  (to be clear - I find the &lt;think&gt; section useful, but it also means waiting for more tokens)Personally - I end up moving down to lower quality models (quants/less params) until I hit about 15 tokens/second.   For chat, that seems to be the magical spot where I stop caring and it's "fast enough" to keep me engaged.For inline code helpers (ex - copilot) you really need to be up near 30 tokens/second to make it feel fast enough to be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865575</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "dead games," which refers to video games that have lost their player base and online support, resulting in diminished or nonexistent community activity. It explores various factors that contribute to a game becoming "dead," including poor updates, lack of developer support, and competition from other games. The author reflects on personal experiences with such games, emphasizing the sense of nostalgia and disappointment associated with watching once-thriving communities fade away. The piece serves as a commentary on the ephemeral nature of gaming popularity and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I definitely advocate for Ross Scott's effort behind https://www.stopkillinggames.com, there are still many titles I think that really don't qualify for the level of effort to keep them preserved. I am too old for Roblox, I have tried some Fortnite, but in my day shakes stick, new ideas were expressed through some kind of mod. DOTA and CS are exceptional examples of this.Not every idea has the automatic inertia it needs to be the next big hit.I also speak as fan of games like Deceive Inc and First Class Trouble, I applaud Garry's effort in this case. The game engines and distribution platforms make it a lot easier to push your idea as a product instead of being just that, an idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting game like this is Space Hulk (2013).A great game imho. Perfectly true to the board game and fun to play. Some negative reviews due to being a digital board game but it’s right up my alley personally.I bought it on steam back then. Still installable and runs but you can’t buy it anymore as the license expired. In fact you can’t easily obtain this at all now. The owners couldn’t give it away even if they wanted to.https://delistedgames.com/space-hulk-2013/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've often wondered similarly for movies, especially CGI. So much time and money is spent to make complicated environments and intricate character models -- the end result gets preserved in the final cut, but what happens to the original assets? Do VFX studios typically maintain archives of past material, or does it all get wiped after each project? I'd think it would be handy to have for remasters, sequels, etc., even if they don't really care about preservation for preservation's sake. Physical props end up in museums or fetch a high price at auction from private collectors, but whither Avengers_Endgame_Thanos_final_final_FINAL.obj?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42870230</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;Jevons Paradox refers to the observation that as technological advancements increase the efficiency with which a resource is utilized, the overall consumption of that resource may actually rise rather than fall. Named after the British economist William Stanley Jevons, who noted this phenomenon in relation to coal consumption in the 19th century, the paradox highlights the counterintuitive relationship between efficiency and consumption. It suggests that improvements in efficiency can lead to lower costs and increased demand, ultimately resulting in greater resource use. The concept has significant implications for environmental policy and resource management, as it underscores the complexity of achieving conservation goals through efficiency alone.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Energy-efficient lighting, such as LED bulbs, has become a popular solution to reduce energy consumption. However, it serves as a notable example of the Jevons Paradox. While LEDs significantly lower the cost of lighting per unit, this reduction often leads to increased usage. For instance, people may install more lights in their homes or businesses, use them for longer durations, or adopt decorative and outdoor lighting more extensively. As a result, the total energy consumption for lighting has not decreased significantly despite the efficiency improvements.This felt false to me, LED bulbs are generally 10x more efficient, so the average number of lights would have had to increase 10 fold, and this is ignoring the savings from not having AC cool those other 50 watts a bulb that went to heat.So I took a look at the source, which doesn't actually have a source and just links to another white paper that claims light pollution increased, but is unclear about how much and due to what. Perhaps that whitepaper links to another whitepaper, but this is where I stopped.Kind of makes me question how often I blindly trust Wikipedia, though this point in particular is pretty minor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intuition behind this is that people who had a usecase for the tech but were locked out because they couldn't afford it, or didn't believe it was worth it usecase can be engineers or researchers. Some of these people may perform better than expected causing a gap in true market value which is filled when they scale up to their new sizeRelated: Jenson's Paradox: The more you buy, The more you save&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is IMO a spefic case of the induced demand concept (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42863808</guid></item><item><title>42.

This advisory emphasizes that AI firms must be transparent about their data usage and adhere to existing legal frameworks, particularly concerning consumer privacy and anti-discrimination.

that appear to represent people, events, and utterances that never existed or occurred would likely be
deceptive.4&gt; Likewise, in many contexts it would likely be deceptive to fail to disclose that AI has been used to
create a piece of media.Under this logic a company making pencils is illegal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though he’s right, Rob Bonta is going to get himself fired, while Scott Wiener will write a bill legalizing training on non expressly licensed data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865174</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even before the rise of AI music, they started "customizing" playlists based on the algorithm, so that you see different songs compared to someone else who subscribes to the same playlist.This was one of the reasons why I left Spotify. There are hundreds of posts about this issue on the Spotify community site, e.g.https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Option-to...https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Spotify-P...https://community.spotify.com/t5/Your-Library/I-Sent-a-Playl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Spotify experience was poisoned as soon as I signed up some 8 years ago to try it; I realized there was no way to remove the popular but garbage music from the dashboard. It was essentially advertising space for slop. So I cancelled my subscription within 1-2 days. I instead ended up going with Youtube Music which doesn't try to push propaganda on me and instead either shows me what I have in my library already that I have saved and/or uploaded myself, and music that they think I'd enjoy based off of my library.Prior to this like many other people I was a hardcore Grooveshark fan/user. There were other services, but their names escape me at the moment. I was looking for a replacement and platforms kept coming and going, but Youtube Music (for all of Google's faults) seem to have stayed all this time. I'm still using it, it's still not pushing slop on me. I'm happy.As an aside, accepting that I'm in the minority here speaking on behalf of them, I am not someone who would write a blog post announcing that I'm leaving some shitty platform. I'll just cancel my sub and move on. I don't need nor want to grandstand regardless of AI or just people's shit taste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the headline was mocking Shopify, not Spotify.  It shows how little creativity we have in tech company naming.I wonder which suffix is more popular, -ify, -ly, or -r.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860113</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses remarks made by TSMC founder Morris Chang, who stated that Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed skepticism about Intel's capabilities as a semiconductor foundry. Chang implies that Cook believes Intel lacks the necessary expertise to compete effectively in the foundry market, a space where TSMC has established itself as a leader. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and competition in the tech industry regarding semiconductor manufacturing, with a particular focus on Apple’s partnerships and Intel’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2011).  And Cook was right.  I worked at Intel for a few years during that decade and the foundry efforts were just not set up for success; in my area, they hired a bunch of new people, put up a firewall between us internal folks and the foundry folks, then without any guidance turned them loose.  I was not even allowed to talk to them to troubleshoot equipment issues.  They also got all of the equipment that we’d rejected for various reasons like poor process control, so they were newbies with worse equipment trying to start up a new group without help beyond what vendors would provide (for $$$)I have no insight into the customer facing side&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This situation has been and maybe always will be common. Those who view themselves as integrated manufacturers of *products* often cannot equally package, deliver, and sell their component *services*. No matter how good those services are at delivering the end product—and sometimes they are completely world-class or genuinely unique—they're almost always highly designed, refined, and evolved over years to map to the specific end products and their one business. They are NOT designed, refined, or evolved to be reusable, retargetable capabilities for all interested parties.By any rights, the major systems manufacturers of the 2000s—Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, Sun Microsystems—should have had an enormous leg up in becoming the planetary scale, "red shift" cloud computing providers of today. Let's kick major operating environment vendors of that era in for good measure—Microsoft, Red Hat, VMware. Maybe even Oracle and SAP. They had the technical capabilities, the economies of scale, the vendor ecosystems, the customer relationships, the financial might. "Permission to win." Yet, only a few have made it. Microsoft has made the transition with Azure, but it's been a long hard pull. Maybe a few participation trophies for IBM and Oracle. But as a group, where are they, cloud-wise? Not too impressive that AWS and Google and others that had no classic "required assets" or "permission to win" have wiped them off the playing field or kicked them deep into the "others" bin.You can call that classic innovator's dilemma, and there's a lot to that. It's insanely, unfathomably hard to disrupt your own current successful business for new delivery models and aspirations. But there's something else as well: services and products are different beasts. They take different mindsets, expectations, business models, and metrics. All the best to Intel in becoming that new thing, a service provider. But it not just a side gig or slight extension. It's a radically different thing, and it's no wonder the highly successful product Intel of 2011 wasn't also a good service provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;TSMC founder says Tim Cook told him in 2011 that Intel did not know how to be a foundryThat is the Original Title. It could be edited as  "Tim Cook told TSMC in 2011 that Intel did not know how to be a foundry" - That would still have been accurate with the date on.Now the title has been editorialised, and meant or imply something else. Like most of the comments are already suggesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868531</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how the pervasive use of smartphones and social media can negatively impact individuals' self-esteem and body image, leading to feelings of unattractiveness and decreased sexual desire. It highlights that constant exposure to curated images on social media can create unrealistic standards, fostering comparison and dissatisfaction. The author emphasizes the importance of disconnecting from digital distractions to cultivate a healthier self-image and improve emotional well-being. The piece advocates for mindfulness and self-acceptance as key strategies for overcoming the adverse effects of technology on personal confidence and sexual attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised by the negative comments here so far that sound more indignant or "called out" than anything else.The article's argument is not only thoughtfully made and unusually well-written, in my opinion it's correct. There's nothing sexy about essentially staring at something in your hand for an hour or more every day. Smartphones provide a level of private immersion in silent, "socially-flavored" dopamine consumption that's antithetical to robust, vibrant socialization. Which is decidedly not sexy.taps add comment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The time pressures of every day life, which has gotten more complicated, are probably why we gravitate towards instant gratification more often. You don't have the time or energy to go to the library for books on a work day, especially with a commute. Same with any other activity. Working hard to finish your work ahead of time results in more work. Innovation's reward is not more free time, it's more work of a different kind.Blaming phones is a distraction. If it weren't phones, we'd still be couch potatoes lazily scrolling through channels to find something to watch. The core issue is we only have time/energy these days for our job's work and the lazy resting which seeks instant gratification.Next time someone's unemployed, try doing nothing but social media for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week on a couch and see you'll eventually get bored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a tremendous piece. It rings so very true.I was 18 in 1990. I'm undoutebdly rose-tinting it but it was indeed edgy and weird and loaded and cool and unknown and just basically fucking brilliant.I look at my teen / 20's kids now and although they're brilliant and doing rad things and out there in the world being great - they're also slightly reserved, spoilt for choice, their generation less able to take hard knocks or deal with unknowns. It's kinda sad I think. Here's hoping we'll find ways to get back to more of what's actually real and important and well, sexy...!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864595</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The website discusses the concept of "the Mikhailian" and its relevance in promoting cultural and social initiatives aimed at enhancing community engagement and values.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a mysterious thing how the influencers of various kind
in software engineering, have to jump from something new to
something new. Even if the "new" new has been created a long 
time ago.Using old systems is in no way fashionable.
Everyone wants the latest whatnot on their resume to be more attractive
for future job opportunities.We are forever stuck in a fast fashion web.I like to think about typed vs non typed langauges 
For a long time they both existed in relativ harmony 
(much more so than emacs vs vi).Then it became the THE THING to use non typed langues.
In part because "having to write the type in the
code was far too much work".We got young software developers who had never used a 
type langauge but who had joined the "church of non typed".Skipping ahead, some influencer discovers typed languages
and how it solves many problems. 
What about that.Choices are good.
We can make informed choices as to what tool makes the 
most sense in the context of what we are trying to solve.
(and its fit with the team and the legacy code etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a management principle here that the tech world doesn't seem to have internalised yet. It is linked to the basic problem that we can't measure programmer productivity.Software tends to be modularised based on a company's management structure. What the components do tends to reflect the manager. When the manager changes, the software either starts to change too or succumbs to bitrot. It is pretty normal for tech companies to start listing after the original founders move on - even a company like Google or Microsoft with money and technically strong individual employees starts to mean regress as new managers come in who have a different and murkier vision than the founders.With luck the transition can be from excellence to a different form of excellence, but the basic strategy people seem to have that management is to be encoded in the org structure and bureaucratic processes doesn't seem to work at preserving high-performing tech companies. It depends on specific people in key leadership positions. Because if they get swapped out there is no way to measure the productivity change less effective managers foist on developers until the company has notably mean regressed years later.I'd bet something like this happened here. A team lead or someone was swapped out and replaced with someone who thought differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is clearly a failure of engineering leadership. I am still puzzled why.I personally believe it’s lack of good engineering leadership and it’s only getting worse at this point. I’ve experienced a fair share of technical leaders without enough technical background and/or experience - people/leadership skills is equally important imho, but people with both are  hard to find (scarce resource) and it seems like it’s often the tech side that gets compromised.I think one of the reasons is the IT industry is simply growing too fast, meaning we have a very small pool of people with many years of experience and a very large pool of people with less experience (compared to other industries). But we do need technical leaders, hence the compromise (need?) to pick people with less experience. Unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42862288</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the effectiveness of code suggestions generated by large language models (LLMs) and emphasizes the principle of "less is more." It argues that providing concise, focused suggestions can enhance the coding experience and improve productivity for developers. The piece suggests that overly complex or numerous code suggestions can overwhelm users and lead to confusion, while streamlined and relevant recommendations can foster better understanding and quicker implementation. By prioritizing quality over quantity in code suggestions, LLMs can better support developers in their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;XCode's assistant AI suggestions are 99% ridiculous, often don't make sense, don't compile, or have nothing to do with my project. Every once in a while it suggests a line or so that is fine. The biggest issue is I want code completion and it appends extra items that make no sense at all, requiring that I either backspace a bunch, or have to use a mouse to pick from the menu. I haven't used Copilot or one of the others, so don't know if this is normal or Apple's is just stupid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So even the LLMs want to keep doing just easy stuff given a choice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This matches my experience working with LLMs. I've built several applications that require an LLM to consider several factors or "zoom levels," and I have yet to work with a model that can do that in a single shot. Instead, you need to have multiple passes for each area of focus. Rather than "edit this manuscript," you want "find all the typos," then "find all the run-on sentences," etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42866702</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprised I'd see this on here!The article doesn't do justice for the Bhat Museum in Kargil. It's really cool seeing the proto-globalization that was increasingly common for us residents in the High Himalayas in the 19th and 20th century.It also is difficult to describe how unique Inner/Central Asian culture is due to the syncretic nature of trade, as well as the isolation that arises due to valleys being cut off for several months of the year.This lead to some interesting cultural artifacts such as marrying off daughters outside of your valley (to prevent incest), identifying a person's valley based on their surname, relic populations speaking language isolates, and much older cultural traditons remaining alive while dying out in much more connected and populated neighborsMy great-grandad also had stories like that of Munshi Bhat's of the various mountain trails and paths that connected Jammu, Manali, Leh, Kargil, Skardu, Kashgar, Karglik, Murghab, Changtang plains, etc.There was a series on MTV India called "Way Back Home" [0]
that showed a lot of these small towns and the interconnections (albeit primarily concentrating on Upper Himachal and Leh).Also, the old NH1 highway via Zojila is getting deprecated for an all-weather highway via Zanskar. A similar thing happened in neighboring Himachal with the Atal Tunnel connected Kullu Valley with Spiti Valley.I have some recommendations of good museums and towns/villages to visit on the Indian side (Ladakh, Himachal, Jammu Division) if interested.[0] - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-6C9zIEdU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Five photos of mountains.A single photo of a museum housing the "ancient discovery" (crates full of fancy goods from all over the world).Not a single photo of a specific item from the "ancient discovery" (crates full of fancy goods from all over the world).Journalism. BBC.(Also, implying that goods from New York were being traded on the Silk Road is a huge stretch.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My first thought was that someone discovered Ross Ulbricht was freed and expecting to put Silk Road back on the map :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858187</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the upcoming introduction of the Temporal API in JavaScript, which aims to address the shortcomings of the existing Date object by providing a more comprehensive and user-friendly way to handle dates and times. It highlights the API's key features, including better support for time zones, date arithmetic, and immutability, which will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of date and time manipulations in applications. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of the Temporal API in making JavaScript development more straightforward and reliable for developers, as it resolves many common pitfalls associated with date handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Temporal is great. I've been using it for a while in production using a polyfill [1], and it solves all issues I've encountered with the old Date() API (which is a lot).It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java and combines them into a nice API that's pretty comfortable to use.Yes, it is a bit more complex to handle since it separates time into naive time, instant and zoned time. But by experience, developers only confront complexity when they are forced to, and time _is_ complex.If you want to do the operation "add one day to this timestamp", you _must_ decide whether that timestamp is local to a specific timezone and which one. Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DST, or when the user switches time zones, or when you deploy on a server with a different timezone.It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a "fixed-offset" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris).[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man, that took some time to find in the docs:Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.withTimeZone() [0], which allows to convert from one timezone to another   const meetingTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(
     "2021-08-01T12:00[America/New_York]",
   );

   const meetingTimeInParis = meetingTime.withTimeZone("Europe/Paris");
 
   console.log(meetingTimeInParis.toString()); // 2021-08-01T18:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]


To me, timezone translations as well as durations are such an essential thing which libraries must handle, and it's nice to see that Temporal handles both. But it looks like Temporal.Duration doesn't offer a custom `format` function, for example `duration.format('H\hmm\m')` or something like that to format a duration into 1h03m.[0] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are quite a few things marinating in the TC39 pot right now. This is one that I wish would ship sooner, rather than later. I do recognize that it takes dev effort (on the part of v8, JSC, and SpiderMonkey engineers) to get the major browsers to support any of these new features. So I truly appreciate all that folks are doing to move the ball forward. The impatient person in me is cheering, "now get Records and Tuples going too! You can skip that silly Pipe-syntax war if you want!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840</guid></item><item><title>2.

This is obviously extremely silly, because that's exactly how OpenAI got all of its training data in the first place - by scraping other peoples' data off the internet."DeepSeek trained on our outputs, and so their claims of replicating o1-level performance from scratch are not really true" This is at least plausibly a valid claim. The DeepSeek R1 paper shows that distillation is really powerful (e.g. they show Llama models get a huge boost by finetuning on R1 outputs), and if it were the case that DeepSeek were using a bunch of o1 outputs to train their model, that would legitimately cast doubt on the narrative of training efficiency. But that's a separate question from whether it's somehow unethical to use OpenAI's data the same way OpenAI uses everyone else's data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “It’s also extremely hard to rally a big talented research team to charge a new hill in the fog together,” he added. “This is the key to driving progress forward.”Well I think DeepSeek releasing it open source and on an MIT license will rally the big talent. The open sourcing of a new technology has always driven progress in the past.The last paragraph too is where OpenAi seems to be focusing their efforts..&gt; we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models ..&gt; ... we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.So they'll go for getting DeepSeek banned like TikTok was now that a precedent has been set ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42861475</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Other than increased miniaturization, the most striking change is the use of copper pours [...] Why did we start doing this?We've been doing something a lot like this for as long as I can remember.Back in the 1990s if there were any big unused copper areas on your PCB you'd mask them to save on etching acid - a gallon of acid would have a lifetime measured in square inches of copper removed, and the less copper you removed, the longer your acid would last.Meanwhile, a lot of DIY etching processes were very basic. Sure, you could get translucent acid and a transparent bath and heat it to a controlled temperature and run bubbles through it and so on. But if you were on a budget, some room temperature ferric chloride in an old ice cream container would get the job done. And getting the etch resist onto the board? You could draw it by hand with special pens, use transfers, there were special printer toner transfer papers, or you could DIY UV photoresist using printable projector transparencies and the sun as your UV source.This was not a super-scientific, tightly controlled process.If you had narrow traces and narrow gaps on one part of your PCB, and large areas of copper to remove on another? Well, if you left it in the acid long enough to remove that large area, could be the narrow traces get etched away too.So masking off any large areas meant all the copper getting etched was about the same width - thus compensating for the poorly controlled etching process.Of course, these days professional PCB manufacturing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it used to be. When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The return current on the back is free to spread out, but in practice, it will prefer the path of least resistance — i.e., the shortest line between the two vias.This is a bit misleading. It does preferentially flow along the shortest path, but not exclusively. It will indeed spread out. It takes all paths with a current proportional to their resistance, not just the shortest path. The percentage of total current that isn't flowing directly along the shortest path is still very significant.Think of it as a bunch of resistors in parallel. The shortest path might be 0.1ohm, and the longest path 10x longer at 1ohm, but current will be flowing along both of those paths. If 1A is flowing down the shortest path, you will still have 100mA down the 10x length path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of my all time favorite videos (one of the few that I rewatch once per year) is "The Extreme Importance of PC Board Stack-Up with Rick Hartley". It's fantastic.https://resources.altium.com/p/the-extreme-importance-of-pc-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874885</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;A commercial jetliner collided with a police helicopter near Reagan National Airport, resulting in significant damage to the helicopter but no reported injuries among its crew. The incident occurred during the helicopter's routine patrol in the airspace. Authorities are investigating the collision, and statements from both the police and aviation officials indicate a focus on safety and coordination in air traffic to prevent future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not that being near DC affords me any kind of right to an opinion, but:Given the uptick in near miss incidents across the US the last few years, this is the kind of incident that should've been entirely avoidable through changes in policy from these past events but is also apparently the only kind that can spur along policy changes. I can see a world where the fault is on the VH-60, but absent more information, it would surprise me less to hear that it's the fault of the tower.Knowing where AA5342 was in its approach, I see no possibility of the jet being at fault.https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL5342I'm drawing a lot of early conclusions but it's mostly because I'm just not surprised. Angry as someone who flies a bunch, but not surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To put this in perspective, this is the first fatal crash of a US commercial airliner in 16 years (Colgan Air Flight 3407 on February 12, 2009) and the first fatal commercial airliner crash in the United States in 12 years (since Asiana Airlines Flight 214 on July 6, 2013).We like to throw shade at Boeing, the FAA etc, but this is still an incredible accomplishment, especially given the explosive growth of traffic over those years.  Back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were far fewer flights but multiple crashes every year was the norm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wasn't a police chopper, it was a military VH-60, also known as a "White Hawk" [1]. It's a VIP transport helicopter, the same type that is used to transport the president.~The flight track of the helicopter [2] starts at a property in McLean, VA (edited to remove likely inaccurate info)~The chopper was based out of Fort Belvoir, and based on similar past flight tracks, looks like it probably took off from there too. CNN is reporting that there were 3 soldiers onboard, and no VIPs.1: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_VH-60N_White_Hawk2: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ae313d&amp;lat=38.952&amp;lon=-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874301</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The document titled "Antiqua et Nova" addresses the significance and role of the Roman Catholic Church's liturgy, emphasizing its continuity and evolution over the centuries. It outlines the Church's commitment to preserving the rich traditions of the liturgy while also adapting to contemporary needs and contexts. The text reflects on the theological foundations of liturgical practice, articulates the importance of active participation by the faithful, and underscores the necessity of liturgical reform to better foster spiritual growth. Overall, it serves as guidance for clergy and laity concerning the celebration of the liturgy in a way that honors both tradition and modernity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to appreciate how well written and thought out this was. I have spent countless hours reading over ethics on AI, especially from Big Tech sources, but this note is leaps beyond. I compare this to the disastrous letter that effectively knee-capped American AI all while proposing flimsy AI ethics within about 500 words (https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experime...). This should be another red flag when America's $500 Billion Stargate project is being led by people including Sam Altman and Larry Ellison, who are singing doomsday prophecies while the Vatican is making sincere efforts to understand AI.I'm really caught admiring this and think this may very well be the AI Magna Carta. There are so many gems and while many of the sources are based on Catholicism, there is also an incredible depth of research, even going into "On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf. M. Heidegger." The note also builds upon numerous different discussions from the Vatican including this supplemental one, https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2024/ju...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked the simple observation in point 35: 'as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word ‘intelligence’” in connection with AI “can prove misleading”[69] and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person.' I was texting my buddy that the proper acronym could be ABNECUI (Almost, But Not Entirely, Completely Unlike Intelligence, to rip something from Douglas Adams).At a more profound level, I really appreciated point 18 under "Relationality": 'human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we learn through others.'I was raised Protestant, but taught to be fundamentally skeptical of the political and historical baggage of any religious institution. Though I recognize that writings like this are a result of deeply held faith, it always feels paradoxical when leaders wax poetic about the mystery of God and then say 'so here is what God thinks you should do.' How could they know? That probably sounds basic, but it is my reaction. What draws me back in is the emphasis on our relationships with other human beings. Those relationships are the things that are actually in front of us, and can make a meaningful difference in our day-to-day lives. Something very useful to keep in mind when developing AI (or ABNECUI).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great demonstration of the fact that people coming from very different perspectives can, through good faith inquiry, find much to agree on. I think there are a lot of thoughtful arguments and conclusions in here even though I generally find the catholic church's metaphysical pyrotechnics to be fairly ridiculous. It goes to show that E.O. Wilson's concept of "consilience" can apply even outside of sciences - just as different lines of scientific inquiry converge on a common reality, so can very disparate forms of moral inquiry converge because they both proceed from a shared human experience of what's good and bad in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877709</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almost. There are a million tools like this, but most "don't get it". The problem with TablePlus, DataGrip and most other GUIs for databases or even Airtable clones like NocoDB or VisualDB is they lack the 3 core features I want. Atleast this tool has 2 of the 3, which is already an improvement to anything else I know of.1. Ability to view relationships inline. It's shocking that most GUIs for databases don't do this. I don't want to see a foreign ID, I want to see a sample of the related row. Glad this tool gets it.2. Filtering and grouping and views. Not simple SQL WHEREs but easy filters. And grouping by header. This is what made Airtable king. Glad to see it is covered here.3. AI-generated queries and reports. Sorry, but it's 2025 and you release a product without AI? It's now trivial to generate correct SQL queries and graphs based on natural language. Why doesn't any mainstream tool do this? See for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooWaPVvljlUHaving all of these 3 core features together in the same tool would be the holy grail for me in database management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mathesar project lead here, it's a nice surprise to see this on the front page! I'm happy to answer questions if anyone has any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a great looking interface but I have the same gripe with the tagline that I have with Grist's. It's really not spreadsheet like is it? You just don't have the row and column manipulation possibilites that defines a spreadsheet vs a table.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873312</guid></item><item><title>7.

It's impressive the amount of really big projects he has finished over the years. His YouTube channel has all sorts of interesting projects on it.If you're into homemade instruments and the process behind making them, bellowphone is fun one to check out.  He goes into detail about his builds and also has performances of himself playing his wacky creations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald E.

I have no place in my home really, I know I could just buy a Studiologic pedalboard with 17 keys, along with SL X SE, but it's quite expensive and space consuming...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I first saw the headline, I imagined a big huge organ with 100 keys and pedals, lots of stops, and huge pipes.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see something small, with maybe 48 keys, and a handful of creatively-placed pipes!Sometimes when we imagine a project, we think about how big it is, and get discouraged -- but this is a good reminder that some of the best projects are small, and thus, are less daunting and more easily tackled!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831969</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intersection of gaming and nihilism, exploring how video games often reflect existential themes and challenges faced by players. It highlights the ways in which gamers navigate meaning and purpose through their experiences, particularly in a virtual environment. The post also examines the implications of adopting a nihilistic mindset in gaming cultures and its potential impact on community interactions and individual gaming experiences. Overall, it invites reflection on the deeper philosophical questions that gaming can provoke.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Those who have paid even passing attention to modern productivity software will recognize the language and aim of Agenda, a project from more than 30 years ago, and therefore the broad endeavor of saving time, breaking silos, and endlessly iterating on what essentially amounts to the same few products, over and over, decade after decade.Despite the posted title, this article is really about productivity apps and the people who use them. For each new app, they hope that this one will finally be the one that magically makes them "productive" where all the previous ones have failed. It then goes on to speculate on why they would do so and subsequently veers off into tangents on bullshit jobs, the role of middle managers in startups and (through a somewhat tortured metaphor of gaming as self-actualization) the role of leisure in the modern economy.Fun article but not really about product hunt after the first few paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, the dominance of post-USSR countries (Ukraine, Russia, Belarus) among makers/hunters is not surprising at all, and can be explained by a somewhat inflated, romanticized, almost evangelistic view on computer technologies in these countries.The computer technologies and associated market could freely develop in those countries after the USSR collapse in 1992. This tendency was fueled by the abundance of high quality STEM education traditionally available in the region. (Historically, STEM education was subsidized by the USSR government and its military ambitions.)I believe that the digital evangelism arose due to exceptional freedom of IT companies in those countries. While other, more traditional industries have been raided and decimated by their own corrupt governments, the IT sector remained out of reach of dirty hands.Those circumstances gave the IT industry in the post-Soviet countries a significant advantage. It was a melting pot of new ideas, makers, universities, companies and startups.Since then, however, the dynamics changed due to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. A lot of companies already committed an exodus to other jurisdictions, while remaining companies will be forced to make it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did similar kind of research for IndieHackers: https://www.softwaredesign.ing/blog/real-world-stats-for-boo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830478</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, California police misused state databases over 7,000 times, according to reports highlighting significant instances of unauthorized access to sensitive information. The misuse involved accessing information for non-law enforcement purposes, such as personal favors or conducting background checks on acquaintances. This trend raised concerns about privacy violations and the accountability of law enforcement agencies, prompting calls for stricter regulations and oversight regarding the access and use of these databases to protect citizens' privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A Redding Police Department officer in 2021 was charged with six misdemeanors after being accused of accessing CLETS to set up a traffic stop for his fiancée's ex-husband, resulting in the man's car being towed and impounded, the local outlet A News Cafe reported. Court records show the officer was fired, but he was ultimately acquitted by a jury in the criminal case. He now works for a different police department 30 miles away.When people say "I don't see why privacy matters, I have nothing to hide" this is the exact kind of edge-case I always think about.The problem with a lot of these massive surveillance systems is that a lot of people end up with access to them, and some of those people may not be trustworthy.In this case, your ex-wife gets engaged to a cop and now they're abusing their access to databases to cause you harm.(That note that "he now works for a different police department 30 miles away" is such a toxic aspect of American policing: cops who get fired for stuff like this inevitably end up in the exact same job somewhere else.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  In 2021 alone, the FBI conducted up to 3.4 million warrantless searches of Section 702 data to find Americans’ communications. --https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/internal-documents-show-how-little-fbi-did-correct-misuse-section-702-databases

So the story is that California isn't holding up their end of the police state? Compared to the FBI they're hardly trying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Database use can NOT be limited by policy. If the data is there, people with access to it WILL use it for whatever they want, even if that's simply because nobody told them what the restrictions are.The best way to prevent misuse of data is not to have it. The second best way is to only allow access through technical means with proper access control at the query level and never access to the raw data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880807</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been maintaining a semi-successful blog [1] for the last five years and have learned a few things along the way:- Own your content: Medium, Substack, Hashnode, Dev.to—all of them suck. Your readers deserve better. Don’t waste their time.- No one cares about the technology behind your site unless it’s huge. So it should be the least of your concerns. Don’t be that JS guy who rewrites their entire site every week in a different stack and writes a blog post about it.- Consistently writing is a lot of work, and there’s no way around it.- Picking a niche and writing about it yields better results than trying to write about anything and everything.- No one will probably read it for a long time, and that’s okay. You should write only for yourself in the beginning.- POSSE is the way to go. If you don’t promote your work, no one else will.- That said, if it took less time to write than it would take someone to read, it’s probably not worth writing.[1]: https://rednafi.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best writing advice I ever got was from a college professor—"everybody's got 100 bad essays in them. You just have to get them out."I feel like this is what blogging is especially good for. You can clear out the awful stuff and then try to incrementally improve.I would diametrically disagree with point #7—if you want to write well, you need to revise the hell out of it. I guess pick whose writing you like better, between me and the author, and take the corresponding advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been blogging for just over 20 years at this point, my main takeaways1) Blog for yourself and no-one else. Write things up because you find them interesting or you learned something. Trying to second-guess things like what will be popular or get engagement is not a fun time for what is likely to be a hobby.2) Keep it low maintenance and simple publishing process. I use Github pages and Jekyll, but other similar options are available.3) If you're doing technical content, try to have practical examples. I've had multiple times where I thought I knew how something worked and, in the process of writing a blog with practical examples, found out I was wrong about how it worked!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42872276</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses best practices for proper decoupling in programming and design, emphasizing the importance of separating components to enhance maintainability, scalability, and testability of code. It criticizes the outdated 100NF (100% Normal Form) design approach, arguing that it can lead to overly complex systems that are difficult to manage. The author advocates for a more flexible decoupling strategy that allows for easier integration and modification of software components, ultimately leading to better software architecture and development processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The advice to use 1uF or 2.2uF for typical projects is good. It's common to see higher value capacitors in modern reference designs because this is well known among people who actually engineer circuits instead of copy and paste from 20 year old wisdom.Don't go to a larger package to get more capacitance, though. Capacitors that are physically larger will have worse higher frequency performance. The physical package is part of the limiting factor. Very high speed designs will prefer 0201 capacitors.Also keep in mind the distribution of your decoupling capacitors. Putting a single 2.2uF in a board in place of multiple 100nF caps distributed around the PCB would be a mistake. The decoupling capacitor needs to be physically close to what you're trying to decouple.For hobby projects and microcontrollers most of this just doesn't matter. Pick a capacitor and put it on the board. For real high speed work you have to consider the layout. Number, size, and location of vias around the capacitor has a big impact. Loop area is also a big factor. Don't use narrow traces or locate capacitors far away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, this is bad advice.Peak currents are very much a thing! for anything powered by battery or over USB. When you connect your USB gadget, you don't want it to exceed the USB spec and fry your USB port (or USB hub). That means there is a limit to how much in total capacitance your USB gadget can have before the power surge of connecting its cable becomes an issue. And that means you usually need to use the smallest caps that are OK to do the job. You typically need to use multiple decoupling caps all over the board, so using one that is too large very quickly adds up. That's how you end up using 100nF instead of 1uF.Also, the article complains that 100nF caps have their filtering peak at the wrong frequency, but I'd argue that 20MHz to 40MHz is exactly in line with the rise and fall times of modern ICs, meaning that 100nF caps would even work better than 1uF for those ICs. As an example, look at the PCM5242 datasheet which suggests 100nF caps and their switching times are in the 16ns to 20ns range. Looking at the "impedance plot" in the original article, that means the red line is most suitable ... which is the 100nF 0402 capacitor.The article would be correct if you are working on things using old (slow) ICs and a dedicated power supply. But if you're working on USB power with modern ICs, I believe going from 100nF to 1uF is a step in the wrong direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Critical information for those that aren't aware: MLCC capacitance decreases with applied DC voltage, like, a whole fucking lot. [1]Those 10uF/100V/X7R/1210 capacitors you love for your space constrained designs might only be 1uF at 48V. And it gets worse when choosing smaller package sizes.This caught me completely off-guard. I've always thought an MLCC with a reasonable Dielectric at a given Capacitance would perform at least as well as an Electrolytic or Tantalum (minus fire hazards).[1] (PDF) https://www.digikey.com/Site/Global/Layouts/DownloadPdf.ashx...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830948</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the possibility that many Pokémon playtest cards, which are used for testing new game mechanics and features, may have been printed in 2024. It examines the implications of this timeline on the collectible card market and the authenticity of certain cards circulating in the hobby. The post includes insights from community members, speculating on the impact of these print runs on card availability, collector value, and potential future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it not strike anyone else as wrong that a printer that you own has to do the bidding of the government instead of you? That you have to pay for it to be forensically watermarked against your own interests? And why have all these companies just taken orders from 3 letter agencies about this? Doesn't anyone have integrity? Isn't there anyone who believes that your own possessions shouldn't be made to conspire against you?I guess the whole smartphone thing answers that question far better than a printer...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it interesting that this research seems to be (at a glance from reading that first page of the thread) coming from someone who owns some of these fraudulent cards (and could have just re-sold them and kept their mouth shut).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in this kind of thing, Tavis King is one of the more knowledgable people with regards to mtg.

Remove the clutter and force people to listen to what the tool can produce.The tool as it is now, is being marketed towards yourself, people that wanted to build that tool and know what it is.

The app is also super fast for things like video scrubbing.I wish the app was a more native feeling UI, and I feel they could be doing deeper integration to enable more video playing. I'm a little worried that the app is out of development, but hoping they keep it going for new versions of macOS and AirPlay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More often I see two or maybe even more software products with the same name. In this case Apache Airflow. The two products serve a totally different purpose. I guess for marketing it would be better to have a unique name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there ANY way to send audio from linux to AirPlay speakers?
(I am NOT asking about making Linux an airplay TARGET, which is what Shairport-sync does.)

I was never a big Google Reader guy, I liked traditional clients like NetNewsWire, but the sociability of Google Reader cannot be dismissed.I’m not sure that just bridging RSS to Bluesky is the future… a distinct AT Proto lexicon seems like the actual way forward IMHOExciting times!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've really come full circle. Back when Facebook was a user-friendly place, you could connect any RSS feed to your Facebook feed. My FB was just a collection of things I posted to del.icio.us, flickr, etc etc. It really was a sign of the crapification of that place that was to come when they ripped out this feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll make a plug for n8n which is a tool to rig stuff to other stuff.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of scalable Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems in cloud environments. It highlights the advantages of cloud-based scalability, such as improved resource allocation, dynamic load handling, and enhanced performance for transaction-heavy applications. The author emphasizes the challenge of balancing cost and performance while leveraging cloud technology for OLTP, and explores various architectural considerations to achieve optimal scalability. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a strategic approach to deploying OLTP systems in the cloud to address growing business demands efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun read.  I am a bit curious on not mentioning OLAP, at all?From my experience, the vast majority of complications in systems is people not realizing they are asking an OLAP question while wanting parts of OLTP semantics.I'm also curious how much of this extra complication comes from having a central database that tries to be a source of truth for everything?  As an easy example, inventory systems that try and have a cloud source of truth have obvious problems when on the ground inventory issues crop up.  That is, a lot of the complication is between the distributed nature of the application and database, sure.  But, another large source is the non-distributed abstraction that a central database can represent not centralized activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising that neither this post nor the linked paper that it's about talk about Spanner, and instead only look at Oracle/SQL Server/Postgres. From what I understand, Spanner really does scale up OLTP to global level, where those alternatives struggle beyond regional level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe someone can answer how this is done.Simply, the mad crushing dash to get the last bit of committed inventory.Ticketmaster has 50,000 General Admission Taylor Swift tickets and 1M fans eager to hoover them up.This is a crushing load on a shared resource.I don't know if there's any reasonable outcome from this besides the data center not catching on fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42836306</guid></item><item><title>19.

I'm Tom, a machine learning engineer at the nonprofit research institute Epoch AI [0]. I've been working on building infrastructure to:* run LLM evaluations systematically and at scale* share the data with the public in a rigorous and transparent wayWe use the UK government's Inspect [1] library to run the evaluations.As soon as I saw this news on HN, I evaluated Mistral Small 3 on MATH [2] level 5 (hardest subset, 1,324 questions). I get an accuracy of 0.45 (± 0.011). We sample the LLM 8 times for each question, which lets us obtain less noisy estimates of mean accuracy, and measure the consistency of the LLM's answers. The 1,324*8=10,584 samples represent 8.5M tokens (2M in, 6.5M out).You can see the full transcripts here in Inspect’s interactive interface: https://epoch.ai/inspect-viewer/484131e0/viewer?log_file=htt...Note that MATH is a different benchmark from the MathInstruct [3] mentioned in the OP.It's still early days for Epoch AI's benchmarking work.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was younger, a little cat appeared on our doorstep. We named him Pew. He’s already 16 years old and has been with me throughout my childhood and adolescence - my whole life. Although he recognized my father as his owner, he is still very much a part of mine. When I started living alone, I adopted another ball of happiness from a shelter. I named her Gadget. I love her insanely, and she loves me back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I genuinely recommend a pet, especially a cat, to any depressed person reading this comment with even just a modicum of income. It’s the perfect amount of responsibility and payoff, to put it in terms a robot could understand. It’s very hard to fuck up so badly to cause permanent injury or death, and most unadopted cats live lives much worse than you at your worst. Take the risk, adopt, fix, and grow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The full book is a fantastic read, yet beware that it takes some quite dark turns describing the author's depression at length and it includes some scatological depictions of animal suffering. 
It's ultimately a tale about grief and so it's peculiar that the cover design gives the impression it's a cute, feel-good story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845129</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice initiative!However, few points to consider:- Emerging market regulations can turn from funny to ugly to utterly ridiculous pretty fast. Problem is that most emerging markets see FIAT to stablecoin as a flight to capital and currency depreciation. Think about India, Brazil, SA, Pakistan or any other emerging market with dense population, you might see the same regulator mindset- In any market, if this kind of pegging becomes freely available, than I am pretty sure that one currency to other in physical or digital way would also be very free flow. for example, in UAE, AEd to USD is super easy and takes 10 seconds on any banking app. So unless your goal is to trade, there is no reason to use stable coins instead of just putting in the dollar amount agianst your local currency- Lastly, exchanges have a very large KYCed audience, and they have a very hardcore focus on the P2P markets where they can. If regulators &amp; local volume permit, they will be the first to jump in with heavy marketing budgets.I would be closely following this, and wish you successIf you need any help or advice, drop me an email a.rafay@disrupt.com. Best of luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forgive me for asking but don't crypto currencies amplify the causes of inflation while mostly benefitting majority shareholders of non-stablecoins?I'm about to start making good money and have started to think about how to properly set up myself for a hopefully non-DeepImpact future and as much as I liked the original idea of the Bitcoin and the Blockchain, what it resulted in - so it appears to me - is mostly a bunch of schemes amplifying the damaging effects of financial institutions that we have not been able to integrate solutions for yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish you luck with this. Stablecoin adoption in the developing world is a potentially large and legitimate use case for cryptocurrency.An essay by Ben Kuhn [0], ex-CTO of Wave, raises the most salient objection here. Of the four problems Wave needs to solve, the hardest is providing "an easy way for users to exchange their balance for cash and vice versa." But "Cryptocurrency actually makes this harder."Say your uncle in Pakistan buys some USDC. What can he do with it? Just hold on until he needs to cash out for a house or whatever? Will any stores accept it as currency? Are you imagining a Venmo/Zelle-like application on top where users can then exchange them among themselves?There are already plenty of ways to buy stablecoins. Adoption as a means of exchange is the hard problem. Do you envision this coming about organically? If so, how?[0] https://www.wave.com/en/blog/crypto/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42879661</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used Stats for years and loved it -- for CPU, GPU, memory, and network upload/download speeds.It's fantastic for catching when a bunch of processes haven't been killed and are stuck at 100%. For figuring out if my code is actually running on the GPU or not. For seeing what my network transfer rates are, when a download or transfer gets stuck, and which process is suddenly downloading hundreds of megabytes without telling me?It gives me the security I have a top-level overview of what my computer's up to. Can't imagine my menubar without it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like a clone of iStat Menus which I had installed for years and years till one day I realized I basically never look at it and the icons were just taking up space in my menu bar. I finally un-installed it.The activity monitor in my dock set to show CPU is sufficient for my needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool. I used to pay for iStat Menus, but one day I got a new laptop and couldn't figure out how to download the old version I had bought a license for.IMO it's essential to see cpu / mem / network consumption at all times and, on top of that, the top 5 apps consuming each one of them. It should be a default feature of computing devices by now, but it's so far from that which only benefits bad actors (resource hogs, bad software). I shouldn't have to launch activity monitor every time I want such basic info.I'll try this out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881342</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember working on DCC, a decompiler for C created by Cristina Cifuentes in 1990. It felt like magic and the future, but it was incredibly difficult and interesting. I used it for decompiling firmware and it was hard to convince my boss that we needed it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; If you’ve ever talked to me in person, you’d know that I’m a disbeliever of AI replacing decompilers any time soonDecompilation, seen as a translation problem, is by any means a job that suits AI methods. Give time to researchers to gather enough mappings between source code and machine code, get used to training large predictive models, and you shall see top notch decompilers that beat all engineered methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was an informative article and I hope the author continues the series.Regarding AI-assisted renaming of variables, the author calls this "a strict improvement over traditional decompilation." But looking at the example:    struct IxpMsg {          struct Buffer {
        char* data;              uint8_t* buffer;
        char* pos;               uint8_t* pos;
        char* end;       =&gt;      uint8_t* streamPos;
        _ixpuint size;           uint32_t bufferSize;
        _ixpuint mode;           uint32_t type;
    };                       }
        Ground Truth                ReSym (AI)

I am reluctant to allow the decompiler to influence my judgment about the meaning of variables. `streamPos` is not equivalent to `end`. Consider the issue multiplied by 20 or 100 as many incorrect assumptions, and it would severel cloud your understanding of the decompiled code.Combining this with reasoning models that can justify their labels would be very helpful. UX improvements could also be made to indicate confidence or progressively disclose these assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873825</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damn, there goes my idea. The other day I wondered how far you could go by embedding classical and neural filters in plastic sheets, to make a "magic lens" that does some img2img transformation in real time. E.g. pixelizing should be relatively simple, but I wonder if you could go as far as transforming a small image classifier (say, "cat" vs. "hot dog") into a physical object, to create a passive "lens" that turns incoming light into words ("cat", "hot dog", "N/A")? Feels like it should be doable.Anyway, thanks for the link; I'll study the paper and look up at the references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huygens Optics has a great video "Fourier Optics used for Optical Pattern Recognition". He starts with explaining the Fourier Transform wrt audio, then demonstrates a physical filter that screens the resulting convolution pattern to identify matches. Very cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9FZ4igNxNA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edge detection is used a lot in 2d &amp; 3d graphics, microscopy, telescopy, photography, and a ton of other fields.If this could be done almost instantaneously and without additional energy, it would be very useful.I can imagine having tiny analogue edge detection component in cameras, microscopes, telescopes, and maybe even graphics cards.This could be a part of the future of computing - tiny specialized analogue components for specific tasks.On the other hand, maybe digital compute, whether silicone or futuristic alternatives, will always be cheap enough that the economics will never work out - it'll always just be cheaper to throw more general purpose compute at a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835424</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study that investigates the genetic basis of adaptation in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the evolutionary mechanisms that enable this fruit fly species to cope with environmental stressors. The research identifies specific gene variations associated with increased tolerance to heat, alcohol, and other stressors, highlighting the role of natural selection in shaping genetic diversity. The findings provide insights into the adaptive responses of organisms to changing environments and underscore the importance of genetic factors in evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;

And it has a cool / terrifying website: http://www.meetgraham.com.au/view-grahamQuite fascinating topic to wonder about: how long will it take for the modern era to genetically change us ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would like to see if there is a correlation between Sleep Apnea cases and nose shape to determine if there is a link between humans living in an area they are not adapted to and how that affects their ability to breathe normally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I'm reading this right, the hypothesis seems to be that in drier climates, humans need longer noses (simplifying) to increase the humidity of the air to an optimal level.Did the authors propose a counter-evolutionary pressure, to favor a shorter nose in more humid environments?It's possible that the mechanism would be as simple as "it requires more resources to maintain a longer nose," but I'm also wondering if they suggested anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42875888</guid></item><item><title>26.

I disagree with the wild conjecture why she wrote this request.I believe this request by Joan du Lee is more about making medicine a profession like carpetry, masonry and similar which were supported through masters, journeymen and guilds, than about hindrance based on sex.Midwifes and doulas have been around for millennia in all cultures. In my limited knowledge, I am not aware of a culture where most of these roles are not females.Midwifery is a narrow field, but there were lot of fully acknowledged "doctors".  Our first evidence was for Peseshet (c. 2600 BC, Ancient Egypt), the "Lady Overseer of the Female Physicians", meaning that she was not only the doc but there was an entire "school" of female "docs".There are of course also Enheduanna (c. 2300 BC, Sumer), Mesopotamian Healing Women (c. 2000 BC and earlier), and of course Agnodice, from the Greek tradition (c. 5th century BC and earlier).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832114</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good work.I wonder if there's really a need for separate write to terminal and read output functions? I was hoping that write command itself would execute and return the output of the command, saving back and forth latency.&gt; and it's not always clear when the job is doneI've authored a similar mcp [1] (but without terminal ui)The way I solved it is by setting a special PS1 prompt. So as soon as I get that prompt I know the task is done. I wonder if a similar thing can be done in your mcp?[1] https://github.com/rusiaaman/wcgw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may not have the same functionality, but there is an official AI plugin [1] for iTerm2 (that can be enabled from Settings &gt; AI).[1] https://iterm2.com/ai-plugin.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m about as likely to use this as buy a self-driving car at this point, but thought I’d point out that iTerm does know when the command has finished, thanks to its shell integration scripts, so does that help? Or if that’s not exposed, maybe just set the shell prompt to some distinctive value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880449</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;A study highlighted by New Atlas reveals that young adults who regularly use cannabis may experience changes in brain function related to memory and cognitive tasks. Researchers observed that habitual users showed alterations in brain connectivity and performance on tasks requiring working memory compared to non-users. The findings underscore the potential long-term impacts of cannabis consumption on brain development in young adults, suggesting that early and frequent use might hinder cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm inclined to believe that there is fairly likely to be long-term negative health effects from cannabis use, but that the very obvious correlation many people in this thread can probably identify with their friends in highschool is just that, a correlation, for some reason or series of reasons.My friends who really got into weed at that time were absolutely addicted to it, and some of them I do believe let it affect their reasoning ability, but it's hard to know what they'd have been like had they not been smoking their paychecks away. I regarded them as stupid at the time, but there were few instances where they weren't stoned, and a stoned person is often dumb as hell. In retrospect, one of them was (highly) likely schizophrenic but also intelligent, and would make shatter with his older brother who was definitely a deadbeat at the time, but they both came from the same conflict-laden upbringing, while another was clearly intellectually capable but raised to be emotionally volatile, and the rest were mostly just having fun and quit shortly after.I'm thankful I remained friends with them but didn't get heavily into it at that time, but it's much more difficult for me to frame the weed use as a causal factor in anything besides a sort of dampening of their hypothetical willingness to seek a better existence through other means. As South Park put it, weed lets you feel ok about doing nothing, and that's dangerous in aggregate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One aspect I’m curious about, especially given the younger cohort, is the causal directionality here - especially when I was younger, I knew a lot of people who were self-medicating with cannabis for things like anxiety and ADHD, which also have effects on working memory and executive function. I’ve known enough heavy users long enough that I do believe there’s long term cognitive effects (whether directly or indirectly), but the specific effects and cohorts they were evaluating here gave me some pause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show me a cannabis user without reduced working memory; it's  a feature, not a bug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42873697</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Terence Tao explores the relationships between quaternions and spherical trigonometry, examining how quaternions can be utilized to simplify calculations and concepts within spherical geometry. Tao discusses various applications of quaternions, offering insights into their algebraic properties and geometrical interpretations. The piece also includes examples and visual aids to illustrate the effective use of quaternions in resolving problems related to spherical triangles and transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

See (D) through (K): https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Quater...When i first read this i found it very hard to understand, because i was unfamiliar with spherical trigonometry, but there's quite some beauty to be found there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can certainly use quaternions (as Hamilton demonstrated) or a Clifford algebra to recover the spherical trigonometry laws, but plain vectors work too in a short derivation. It is actually one of the simple exercises introducing reciprocal bases in Louis Brand's book Vector and Tensor Analysis (https://archive.org/details/vectortensoranal00branrich) or its abridged version, Vector Calculus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold up! Omg, can someone who’s done physics chime in please… whenever I’ve looked at GUT etc, I’ve always seen U(n), SU(n), but never knew what they were - are they what’s referred to in this article? Is that just the Unitary Group and Special Unitary Group??! All that time I thought it was all impenetrable but it’s just algebra?Omg wow... the theoretical physics I’m talking about  is just quaternions and Lie Algebra isn’t it? Oh… dont tell me Quantum Spin just called Spin because it’s a Spinor rather than something actually metaphorically spinning?!Please chime in if you know what I’m talking about and can confirm this or shoot it down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42880242</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experiences and challenges faced while learning and working with Rust programming language, particularly focusing on the "hard mode" approach—deliberately tackling more difficult aspects of the language to deepen understanding and skills. It highlights the unique features of Rust, like its ownership model, and emphasizes the importance of embracing complexity and failure as a vital part of the learning process. The author shares practical advice for overcoming common hurdles in Rust, including utilizing community resources and engaging with more challenging projects to enhance proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't help but feel this is reintroducing some of the problems it claims to solve in working around the difficulties.* The fact that there is an `Oom` error that can be thrown means that there is no increase in reliability: you still don't know how much memory you're going to need, but now you have the added problem of asking the user for how much memory you're going to be using — which they are going to be guessing blindly on!* This is because the memory usage is not much more predictable than it would be in easy mode Rust. (Also that "mem.lem()/2" scratch space is kind of crappy; if you're going to do this, do it well. Perhaps in allocating the correct amount of scratch space, you end up with a dynamic allocator at the end of your memory. Does that sound like stack space at the start of memory and heap space at the end of memory? Yes, your programming language does that for you already, but built-in instead of bolted-on.)* Furthermore, the "easy mode" code uses lots of Box, but if you want you can get the benefits of RAII without all the boxes by allocating owned vectors scrupulously. Then you get the benefit of an ownership tracking system in the language's typesystem without having to `unsafe` your way to a half reimplementation of the same. You can get your performance without most of the mess.* Spaghetti can be avoided (if you so desire) in the same way as the previous point.What you do achieve is that at least you can test that Oom condition. Perhaps what you actually want is an allocator that allows for simulating a particular max heap size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s on the caller to explicitly implement a concurrent queue to distributed specific work itemsThe threadpool is usually the easy part of concurrent algorithm's, with the concurrent queue being one of the hardest to implement in a performant manner. The is a "draw the rest of the owl" moment...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article starts with:    &gt; This criticism is aimed at RAII — the language-defining feature of C++, which was wholesale imported to Rust as well.

    &gt; because allocating resources becomes easy, RAII encourages a sloppy attitude to resources

Then lists 4x bullet points about why it is bad.I never once heard this criticism for RAII in C++.  Am I missing something?  Coming from C to C++, RAII was a godsend for me regarding resource clean-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42874605</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a good poem. I learned the original off by heart two months ago to recite it to my sleep-averse child as part of their bedtime routine. It definitely benefits from recitation, which really unearths the lovely wavelike rythms.(edit: this translation does a good job of matching the syllable count, almost perfectly. It does mean it strains a bit in places. But compromises always have to be made!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is about the root of humanity’s problem: the inability to avoid misusing knowledge and technology. 
All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end (Thoreau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh god this poem. It's like generational trauma in German speaking countries. At some point during junior high every student is tasked with learning to recite it by heart. Of course it's not too hard, but there are a million things a thirteen year old kid would rather do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42832021</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the most significant drawbacks of the programming language Rust, particularly its complex and often confusing error messages. It highlights how the language's strict ownership and borrowing rules can lead to frustration for new users, making it difficult to debug issues and understand the compiler's feedback. The author emphasizes that while Rust offers many advantages, such as memory safety and performance, these challenges can hinder productivity and deter developers from embracing the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems not even close to the worst feature of rust - this seems like it needs some more design work and baking. Like lots of things.The amount of hyperbole in this article makes it a bit hard to take the author all that seriously.Is there evidence more baking won't happen?  While i have my loves and hates about rust, it definitely always felt like they had a pretty thorough/careful process for additions like this.
If you go constructively into the threads and offer some concerns, you will usually get some reasonable response.(All processes of course, fail, so this is not always true, but it's mostly true)While i think it's fine to write rants on blogs, and don't feel like everyone has a responsibility to file bugs or whatever before they write a rant about it, if you actually want to see this "worst feature" fixed, this probably won't help very much.(IE You don't have to be constructive, or even helpful, but if you want to be constructive or helpful, this ain't how you do it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more pertinent question to me is can we implement some new static analysis that understands buffer re-use and can hoist buffer initialization outside the loop?  Rather than make the programmer write obfuscated code for efficiency, it is usually better to have the compiler do the heavy lifting.P.S. Also, folks, don't re-use buffers without zeroing unless you absolutely need the performance and know what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe Rust needs another type of reference that's exclusive write only?
Right now there's RO (&amp;T) and exclusive RW (&amp;mut T) but WO is missing.Having a WO reference would allow these read_buf APIs to express they only write and never read so the uninitialized memory is safe to pass directly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42836370</guid></item><item><title>36.

I signed up to check the onboard process.I am in a similar space and our product creates workflows from prompts. Internally it is a JSON schema generator and response parser (from AI). We focus on creating assistants (personal or team) that reside on local computers, can crawl, read from any data source and build a knowledge graph for search, daily tasks, etc.In our UI efforts (we are really behind in this) the graph editor is starting to look like how I see in your product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the path to MS365 integration?

&lt;p&gt;The article guides readers on how to locate the oldest line of code in a Git repository. It explains the significance of identifying legacy code for maintenance and improvement, and provides detailed command-line instructions to help users efficiently pinpoint the oldest commit associated with a specific line in their codebase.

(Since before ISO 8601 even was a thing!)Oldest I found?1986-06-17: Trygve glemte å sjekke om vi deler på null. Fikset.(Trygve forgot to check whether we divide by zero. Fixed.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't need to blame every file[1]. Use `git rev-list` to find your oldest commit:  git rev-list --reverse --date-order HEAD | head -1  # or
  git rev-list --reverse --author-date-order HEAD | head -1

To see the files in that commit:  git ls-tree -lr &lt;commit-id&gt;

To see a particular file:  git show &lt;commit-id&gt;:/path/to/file  # or
  git cat-file -p &lt;commit-id&gt;:/path/to/file

&lt;p&gt;A recent report reveals that a significant majority of U.S. teenagers have lost trust in major technology companies, highlighting concerns about privacy, data security, and the influence of social media on their lives. The findings suggest that teens are increasingly skeptical of how tech companies handle their personal information and perceive these platforms as detrimental to their well-being. This erosion of trust may impact how this demographic engages with technology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember graduating in 2004 and ingesting the message from the [current] BigTech companies that, "this time it'll be different!" and "we aren't like those other companies!" I ate it up, of course. I didn't have the experience to see that the promises were hollow by the nature of the arrangement.Fully expect a new crop of companies to make the same pitch, and people to fall for it again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Between this for new media channels and the breakdown of trust in old media channels there is a lot of reason to be hopeful about the future of the US. One of the big problems of the past was the insane level of trust in institutions that were at best credulous and more realistically just lying continuously and brazenly. It is a big win for the public discourse if people start applying cynicism where warranted.In many ways this is the real transformation change that the internet posited. Manufactured consensuses aren't holding so easily and people are being forced to acknowledge the sausage factory behind them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add the majority of people I know to the pile. As a programmer, I don't think we're in control anymore, and haven't been for quite some time. Money and economics dominates almost every conversation when it comes to tech.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42875399</guid></item><item><title>40.

Their editors are IMO much faster and slicker. I have very light document needs and this other open source software suite serves me very well. Although I appreciate libreoffice, I never did like using it.https://www.onlyoffice.com/https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like it doesn't count the use of libreoffice in Linux distros. I never download it for example.  I suppose that 400mil downloads is probably from Windows and Mac users.I used to consider it very heavy but my daughter's Raspberry pi runs it fine.I use the Draw component the most. It is great for drawing boxes with text connected by arrows which is what my main use case is.  Miro is better because it scales text when you scale a box and if Draw could do this I'd be in heaven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy user for all personal stuff business stuff is all MSFT as I am just an employee.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those of use that haven't use Angular, can you explain what this is doing?  And what's it do that we can't already do with asyncio?  Also, it's weird you have to call `asyncio.sleep(0)`.  Seems like you should be able to `await count.set(5)`.I did look at the repo, but I couldn't easily understand the use case and what exactly it's doing from examples alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kinds of Python programs would benefit from Signals? Most of the Python I've written is either small CLI tools that run to completion, or boring web servers using frameworks like Django that are request-response oriented, which also has a "run-to-completion" model for a request's handler code.Also, I looked at your implementation, and your ComputedSignal implementation is not sound - it can give inconsistent results with respect to the input signals depending on the ordering of reads when you have a ComputedSignal that depends on other ComputedSignal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool (probably), but it's not clear what it does or how useful it is when one doesn't know anything about Angular signals. Could you explain?Also, care to compare to RxPY?

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Case for Kicking the Stone" discusses the importance of confronting uncomfortable truths and the challenges of engaging with difficult subjects in literature and society. It argues for the value of artistic exploration and the emotional weight that comes from grappling with harsh realities, encouraging readers to embrace complexity rather than seek simplistic solutions. Through various examples, the piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of life’s struggles, suggesting that acknowledging these difficulties can lead to greater empathy and meaningful art.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think of "social" media as a fundamentally isolating experience.On modern social media platforms, each person gets their own, personalized feed.As their feed becomes more personalized, it gets more and more isolated from a common, shared cultural context.According to Wilbur Schramm's theories of communication, human to human messages must occur over a shared cultural context, and social media shrinks that shared cultural context.LLMs as a platform could shrink this shared cultural context even more, unless we become more deliberate about fighting back against this "shared experience" shrinking:https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/social-media-is-the-f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not connection but the software and motivations of the companies behind it along with the structure of our society that is the problem. I make music for fun. Half of my online interaction is people looking to make a buck. Connecting in a music space wasn't like that 20 years ago. The conversations I had online 20 years ago are now still happening just in private discords. Connecting in public spaces driven by algo's based purely to serve profit motives and people whose motives aren't connection but clout/politics/selling something doesn't define some universal tech/connection rule.I'm on a locals hiking mail list. We share things like when the kokanee are running. That doesn't get blasted to 20,000 people with zero interest but who will go because they saw it in the equivalent of the local 'what to do this weekend' section of the newspaper. Society has arranged itself so that there is very little to do without spending money. And so those few things of beauty, free, and semi easy to get to get 'devoured' by a very hungry populace.But on the hiking/biking app I have no fear sharing trails because the 'social media' people on the app are only going to trails they can get to within 2 minutes of the highway. People that are going on a 2 hour mountain hike that requires an hour of fire road driving self select out. Plus if we don't get enough people going the trails get overgrown so I need exposure. I am only sharing because I want something out of it (enough traffic to keep the trail accessible) and I don't share my favorite trails outside of the mail list. Social media companies have made sure their experience is purely transactional at this point, not 'connective', but things like selective highly connecting discords/email lists exist and very much connect people in healthy ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reminds me of an old Bruce Sterling quote: "politics pulls us together, technology tears us apart". That always struck me as being directly opposite of our  intuitions as technologists.As a species, we need a wider exploration of how to structure online spaces in a way that builds and sustains social capital instead of usurping it. That's difficult to do with out resorting to censorship and ideological totalitarianism. And it's probably not compatible with the ad-funded addiction-driven business model of most modern platforms.One historical example of note here is Wikipedia. It was a complete failure as a for-profit product, but it skyrocketed in significance when it opened up and adopted the relatively new  social interaction model of the wiki.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42878598</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A comment on code organisation.https://github.com/victorqribeiro/TinyApp/blob/db92225cfd0ae...:  export default function Input(state) {

      const inp = input({  // ①
          type: 'number', value: state.count, onchange
      })

      function update() {  // ②
          inp.value = state.count
      }

      function onchange() {  // ③
          state.count = parseInt(this.value)
      }

      state.addUpdate('count', update)  // ④

      return inp
  }

(Labelling comments mine.)This ordering isn’t great: ① refers to ③, and ④ refers to ②. It’d be better to reorder them, at least to swap ② and ③, and remove the blank line separating ② and ④:  export default function Input(state) {
      const inp = input({  // ①
          type: 'number', value: state.count, onchange
      })

      function onchange() {  // ③
          state.count = parseInt(this.value)
      }

      function update() {  // ②
          inp.value = state.count
      }
      state.addUpdate('count', update)  // ④

      return inp
  }

But you really can do much better:  export default function Input(state) {
      const inp = input({
          type: 'number',
          value: state.count,
          onchange() {
              state.count = parseInt(this.value)
          }
      })

      state.addUpdate('count', function() {
          inp.value = state.count
      })

      return inp
  }

At least at this scale, that’s much easier to follow.Inlining can improve other places too (though at larger scales it becomes more debatable):  export default function Button(state) {
      return button({
          onclick() {
              state.count += 1
          },
          style: {
              color: 'black',
              border: 'solid 1px black'
          },
      }, '+ 1')

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "digital reality" and the phenomenon of "digital shock," which refers to the overwhelming impact of rapid technological advancement on individuals and society. It explores how the constant evolution of digital tools and platforms affects mental health, interpersonal relationships, and the way we perceive reality. The author emphasizes the need for mindfulness and strategies to manage the influx of digital information, encouraging readers to find a balance between embracing technology and maintaining their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology as a narrative element has also evolved.I distinctly remember watching X-Files in the 90s and thinking this is the first TV show where everyone is assumed to have a cell phone. Moreover, the phone nearly always works! When one of the characters goes wandering into some dark spooky forest in British Columbia, it doesn’t mean they’re going to get their own episode or suffer a mysterious death, they just pop open their phone and call their partner. Suddenly every existing story where phone calls can only be received at fixed locations seems as old as Sherlock Holmes sending a wire by messenger. And nowadays you have to explicitly signal danger by having the character pull out their phone and see NO SIGNAL.The second season of Severance has a scene where a character leaves his apartment to make a call at a phone booth down the street. In 1980 this would have just signaled that he wanted to make an anonymous call. In 2025 it is alarming. What is this world he’s in where there are still phone booths? Is a shot with the character framed alone, lit by the harsh light of a phone booth at night, a deliberate reference to The Matrix?What story elements will kids today take for granted? It’s still kind of trendy in stories to show a crowd making videos of something on their phones and causing a ruckus on social media. Maybe ubiquitous video will seem to them like cell phones seemed to us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in 1980 and I find it neat that we grew up without the internet we know now, it was in it's infancy in junior high in high school (93 to 99), and then once we were in the workforce we all got smart phones as we know now. Us Xennials and the millenials that succeeded us (or we're just early millenials) definitely have a unique perspective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was born in the UK in the late sixties. So my formative exposure to cyberspace was- Staying up late with a cassette recorder to record Basicode [1] programs broadcast after-hours on BBC radio, to run on my Vic 20. Somewhere out there was where this stuff was coming from.- Ten minutes on a Prestel [2] terminal at a university science fair in 1984ish. It blew my mind that the thing on the screen wasn't just in the box on the table, and it was coming to me on wires.- Downloading public domain software onto floppies from the PDSA archive at Lancaster Uni using Kermit on an Apollo DN300 and an X25 PAD to access JANET [3].- Reading Omni magazine, which sometimes felt like plugging your brain into a consensual hallucination.- Later on reading imported copies of Wired and Mondo 2000, which was like having a mental VPN into some other place where the tech lived and where it was always California sunshine.Good times[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASICODE[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42831621</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of automating the Git bisect command to efficiently identify the source of bugs in code by using ephemeral environments. It emphasizes the benefits of automating this process, such as saving time and ensuring consistency by creating temporary testing environments for each commit. The author outlines a systematic approach to set up this automation, including leveraging tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for developers looking to streamline their debugging workflow through automation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tricky thing with git bisect run is that you usually have to have your test script not be part of your git checkout for the process to work.This is because of the particular situation that bisect is valuable in; you find a regression that doesn’t have a test, and you aren’t sure when it was committed.First, it has to be a regression; if it is just a bug, then there was no previous version that didn’t have the bug, it just hadn’t been found until now. It has to be something that worked before and now doesn’t.Second, it has to not have had a test before the regression was found. If you had a test for it already, it would have been found by CI as soon as it was committed, and you wouldn’t need to figure out which commit broke it.So if you try to add a test to the normal test suite of the code and commit it, git bisect run is not going to work; as soon as you check out the older code, your new test won’t be there and the tests will pass because your new test of the breakage doesn’t run. You have to have the new test persist across git checkouts. This is not trivial, because you can’t just exclude your test files from being updated by git bisect, since other tests will also be changing through versions. You need to have your tests always include some non-version controlled file, and you need to have added that include PRIOR to your last known good version.The only other use case would be if you are making a lot of commits without running tests, so you actually could break a pre-existing test and not know which commit broke it. If that is your situation, you should probably change your workflow to test every commit instead of trying to get git bisect to work.For these reasons, I have never found ‘git bisect run’ to be as valuable as it seemed when I first learned about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always wished for a "git trisect", or a "git n-sect" in general, that can try multiple commits in parallel. The use case would be for testing changes in software that has a long, single-threaded component in the build process (e.g., a heavily overloaded configure script). For long-running projects where each bisect takes over a dozen steps, those components lead to lots of thumb-twiddling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  Because ephemeral environments are reproducible on demand (via Docker images, Kubernetes pods, or a cloud VM), you can guarantee that each bisect step sees the same conditions. This drastically reduces "works on my machine" fiascos.Agree on this pattern for all code changes. Hard to understate the amount of time we've saved by testing against the full prod-like environment right away. An ephemeral env implementation makes this easy and low stakes, so diving right into E2E testing a copy of your real infra isn't wildly unreasonable. However, I work for Shipyard (https://shipyard.build) so I'm a bit biased on these processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42835054</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a young man's project where he utilized artificial intelligence to design a nuclear reactor, highlighting the capabilities and risks associated with AI in complex engineering tasks. It covers the process he followed, the challenges he faced, and the implications of using AI for such sensitive and potentially dangerous designs. The piece raises questions about ethics and safety in employing advanced technologies for projects that involve significant public safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

https://fusor.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=3247The "artificially intelligent" aspect is trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;HudZah was told that he could be killed by the high voltage, X-ray radiation and possibly other things. This only made him more excited. “My whole intention was, ‘If I fuck up, I’m dead, and this is why I should do it,’” he said.It sounds like he got exactly what he wanted to.&gt;I must admit, though, that the thing that scared me most about HudZah was that he seemed to be living in a different technological universe than I was. If the previous generation were digital natives, HudZah was an AI native.The one thing I'm somewhat ambivalent about is that LLMs are extremely atomizing. It's incredibly easy to go offline for months on end when you're talking to your computer.If I got hit by a bus in 2005 when I was contributing to Linux and Postgres there were people who would pick up what I was doing and carry it forward.If I get hit by a bus today, unless someone went through my chats, no one would really have any idea what I'd been working on and carry it on. I have a suspicion that a ton of the best and brightest have gone dark for this reason in the last two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fusors were invented by Philo T.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there any frame of reference to compare this to? I.e what is the normal fluctuation/movement of that 'datasets available' number? For instance, it dropped by 18k between 9/13 and 10/13.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found https://uc3.cdlib.org/data-mirror/ which was a mirror a few years ago, but it's been taken down due to a lack of ongoing funding.It would be a great start to have a mirror of just the metadata, to at least see what is being removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s interesting, I was looking at the ICE ERO statistics and not only do they show up as not having a published data source, only metadata, the corresponding dashboards at ice.gov/statistics seem to not be working.  I don’t know what the state of either of those was before I looked yesterday, so I don’t know if this is a recent change or not.I was extremely surprised to find out that based on ICE’s annual reports, which are still up, Biden’s administration deported far more people than Trump’s did, especially in 2024 due to rule changes which roughly doubled the number of normal deportations.  I was further surprised to find out that there were roughly 3.5 times more deportations under Biden than under the first Trump administration.I suspect that what’s happening is that leadership under Biden did the sensible thing and very quietly snuck up on priority illegal aliens, whereas with Trump, all the media attention is causing similar people to circle the wagons and proactively take steps to avoid enforcement actions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876055</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a good place to share and discuss Jailbreaks? I've found that you can bypass some of the censorship by "upgrading" it with "&lt;superthink&gt;" which can modify the "&lt;think&gt;" process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also intercept the xhr response which would still stop generation, but the UI won't update, revelaing the thoughts that lead to the content filter:    const filter = t =&gt; t?.split('\n').filter(l =&gt; !l.includes('content_filter')).join('\n');

    ['response', 'responseText'].forEach(prop =&gt; {
      const orig = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(XMLHttpRequest.prototype, prop);
      Object.defineProperty(XMLHttpRequest.prototype, prop, {
        get: function() { return filter(orig.get.call(this)); }
      });
    });

Paste the above in the browser console ^&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN! This is my article!It was great to put together a writeup of a fun evening or two of work. It looks like this goes much deeper.I'm learning a lot from some of the linked articles, one of the base hypothesise of my work was that the filtering was distinct from the model, due to the cost of training with pre-filtered or censored data at scale: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10719, let alone- making it generate a consistent response.However, it looks like this goes further, a separate comment linked this article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858552 on Chain-Of-Thought abandonment when certain topics are discussed.I'll have to look at served vs trained censorship, in different context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:02:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891042</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Jane Street's experience in developing a new build system for OCaml, which emerged from their need to improve their existing tools. They initially set out to simplify their build process but ended up creating a more efficient and effective system that enhanced reliability and speed. The authors share insights into the challenges faced during the development, the design principles they followed, and how their new build system ultimately exceeded their expectations, benefiting their OCaml projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a humorous suggestion to enhance Google searches by adding explicit language, specifically the word "f*cking," to improve the relevance of results and counteract overly generalized AI summaries. It highlights frustrations users have with AI that tends to simplify or misinterpret queries, advocating for a more personalized search experience. The piece emphasizes the absurdity of the tactic while acknowledging the challenges posed by AI in accurately capturing nuanced information.&lt;/p&gt;

All the AI being shoehorned into products and services now are mostly to test, improve, and advertise for the AI being used, not to provide any value for users who'd rather have nothing to do with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I start fucking adding swear words to all my fucking search queries, how the fuck will the stupid ass search engine know that I did not want it to use that shit as one of my keywords and give me back a whole lot of fucked up shit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside of this approach is that it can affect the search results returned. But I found that if you add " -fuck" or " -fucking" to your search term, it disables the AI summary without significantly affecting your search results (unless you happen to be looking for content of a certain kind).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42892191</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "On the Evaluative Properties of Riemannian Metrics" by C. F. D. Allen provides an exploration of Riemannian metrics, focusing on their geometric and analytic properties. It examines their applications in various mathematical contexts and discusses how these metrics can be evaluated in terms of curvature and topology. The work highlights significant theoretical results and offers insights into the implications of these metrics in broader mathematical frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent time working with Andrej and the rest of the FSD team back in 2020/2021, and we had plenty of conversations on how human visual processing maps onto our neural network architectures.
Our approach—transformer-based attention blocks, multi-scale feature extraction, and temporal fusion—mirrors elements of the biological visual cortex (retina → LGN → V1 → V2 → V4 → IT) which break down raw inputs and integrate them over time. It’s amazing how closely this synthetic perceptual pipeline parallels the way our own brains interpret the world.The key insight we discovered was that explicitly enforcing brain-like topographic organization (as some academic work attempts - such as this one here) isn't necessary - what matters is having the right functional components that parallel biological visual processing. Our experience showed that the key elements of biological visual processing - like hierarchical feature extraction and temporal integration - emerge naturally when you build architectures that have to solve real visual tasks.The brain's organization serves its function, not the other way around. This was validated by the real-world performance of our synthetic visual cortex in the Tesla FSD stack.Link to the 2021 Tesla AI day talk: https://www.youtube.com/live/j0z4FweCy4M?t=3010s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main reason topography emerges in physical brains is because spatially distant connections are physically difficult and expensive in biological systems. Artificial neural nets have no such trade-off. So what's the motivation here? I can understand this might be a very good regularizer, so it could help with generalization error on small-data tasks. But hard to see why this should be on the critical path to AGI. As compute and data grows, you want less inductive bias. For example, CNN will beat ViT on small data tasks, but that flips with enough scale because ViT imposes less inductive bias. Or at least any inductive bias should be chosen because it models the structure of the data well, such as with causal transformers and language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper imports an arbitrarily-chosen aspect of cortical architecture — topological maps of function — and ignores every other aspect of biological neural tissue. The resulting models show lower performance for the same number of parameters — not surprising, since they are more constrained compared with baseline. They may be slightly more robust against pruning — not surprising, since they are more regularised.The figures show individual seeds, presumably, with no statistical analysis in the performance or pruning comparisons, so the null hypothesis is there is no difference between toponets and baseline. I would never let this paper be submitted by my team.We haven't learned anything about the brain, or about ANNs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:03:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884338</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The available Linux debuggers are gdb and lldb. They both suck. They crash all the time, don't understand the data types I care about, and they don't make the data I need available at my fingertips as quickly as possible.quote from https://calabro.io/uscopeOf course gdb, lldb have their problems (e.g. smashing tui with app output, what can be easily fixed, or very very very very long tab-tab completion, and crashing of course), but I dont know anything better. I am forced to use visual studio at work and its debugger really sucks - it can't even compare strings in conditional breakpoint, it cant even skip all std::function / std::bind garbage to let me step in callback, it can't watch evaluated expressions.
Probably it can evaluate exprs (immediate window?), but there are very little guides about this.So, gdb is winner for me now.
rr (record-repeat)[0] also looks very nice, but it require hardware support((([0] https://rr-project.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author just did a podcast about Uscope a few minutes ago, where they mention this HN post:https://youtu.be/stWBTv6grBcMentioned at :

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Bravo! This is such an impressive effort. As one of the very first home consoles, the venerable Atari 2600 is brutally difficult to program. Everything from ROM to RAM to CPU cycles is in painfully short supply and the requirement to continually keep 'racing the beam' is a harsh master.My first computer, the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer, came out only a couple years later but even with only 4K of RAM and a sub-1 Mhz CPU, was still much more civilized to program in assembler than a 2600.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had no idea the Atari 2600 was a 6502 (actually 6507) machine until I saw the A9 (load accumulator) instructions in the machine code snippets on this article, despite having an Atari 2600 as a kid. A9 is burned into my head from sixth form electronics, where we would have to manually convert assembly to hex and key it into the boards we used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author doesn't mention it, but many people who never played E.T. read articles in videogame magazines about this game was amongst the things that killed the videogame industry in the 80s.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very interesting article. I worked in the prototype lab of RCA Australia (Artarmon, Sydney) in the late 1960s but left before the division/manufacturing plant was closed down the early 1970s. We made professionsl broadcast and telecommunications equipment and the plant did very well (I mentioned my time there and my meeting with Sarnoff on HN a while back).Thus, it came as quite a shock when I later heard the plant had closed down as only several years earlier ('68 if I recall) Sarnoff Senior (not Robert) had visited the plant and to open a new record factory only about a dozen miles away.As I'd left before the plant was closed I wasn't privy to employees' scuttlebutt about Camden's reasons for closing it so I had to rely on industry rumors for reasons of which there were a number but none was definitive (for me it's always been a bit of a mystery).I was already aware RCA stagnanted from about 1967 onwards but this article's Fig 4 (RCA—1920 to 1986) adds numerical info of which I was unaware such as the steeper downturn  around 1974, which is about when the Australian division was closed. Presumably, this downturn was at least part of the reason (many have long said the '67 decline was due to Robert Sarnoff's mismanagement).I hope someone will soon write a definitive history of RCA, it's important it's written because the Company played such an important/pivotal role in early broadcast/electronics manufacturing (BTW, when I was working there RCA was the biggest electronics company in the world).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RCA and the Nifty Fifties.[1] This is an orientation film for employees.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEPS1uYRCdE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conspicuously missing here is RCA Astro Electronics, responsible for the first weather and satcom satellites, and RCA Missile and Radar, responsible for BMD and radars leading up to the Aegis system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:04:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42868475</guid></item><item><title>15.

In my twenty years at Xerox I watched it slowly (and then quickly) shrink as the dots on paper market shrank.In an alternative universe, Xerox is mentioned in the same breath as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good book on the subject that I recently finished reading:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029PBVCADoes a pretty good job at running through PARC's founding and some of the many reasons why none of its amazing technology took off (Spoilers: it wasn't always Xerox interfering!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RIP to the Living Computers: Museum in Seattle… the last place I was ever able to use one of these machines in the flesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884133</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the concept of singleton classes in Ruby, highlighting their purpose and functionality. It illustrates how singleton classes allow developers to define methods and behavior for a single object, rather than for all instances of a class. The piece offers practical examples to clarify how to create and use singleton classes, demonstrating their utility in scenarios where unique behavior is needed for individual objects. Overall, it serves as an informative guide for Ruby programmers looking to deepen their understanding of this specific feature in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't written any ruby for over a decade and a half, when ruby 2.x was still on the horizon. But I  do know the source of "eigenclass". It was first jokingly used in an odd instructional programming book / web comic / experimental art piece by "why the lucky stiff" who was briefly prominent in ruby-land then erased himself from the internet. It's funny that it has now become an established term of art for Ruby people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There are at least three ways to define a method in a Ruby singleton class.It's worth noting that two of such ways will, perhaps unintuitively, ignore the `private` keyword.  private
  def self.foo
    # ...
  end

  def x.foo
    # ...
  end

That will define a public method `:foo` on each of `self`'s and `x`'s singleton classes. If you want the method to be private, either 1) explicitly make the method private using `Class#private` or `Class#private_class_method` or 2) use the `class &lt;&lt; self` (or `class &lt;&lt; x`) syntax in order for the `private` keyword to work as expected.  private_class_method def self.foo
    # ...
  end

  def self.foo
    # ...
  end
  private_class_method :foo # `def` will return a symbol of the defined method name so the above syntax is usually sufficient.

  def x.foo
    # ...
  end
  x.singleton_class.send :private, :foo # Class#private is a private method(!) so must be called using Object#send.

  class &lt;&lt; x
  private
    def foo
      # ...
    end
  end

&gt; The eternal question… Why is Ruby like this?Joy! :) I'm pretty sure matz would agree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love it when someone dives a bit deeper behind something pretty common for most Ruby devs.  It's actually a really elegant pattern that is used and it's everywhere in Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42845169</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I were king of the forest, there would be a degree program in Comparative Coding (comparative lit for code).We don’t treat this as a creative discipline and thus we don’t spend time looking at masters, how they were successful and the ways they were just as human as anyone.Someone would get paid for writing stuff like this, same as people getting paid to write about Poe, Cummings, Hemingway, Thoreau.But I guess the problem is that the way we price teaching and coding, the gap is far too wide between talking about and doing, unless you do it as a side hustle/hobby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Computer Architecture can be designed around legacy but fun hardwares.So instead of using some fantasy machines such as LC-3, students can directly get into the world of 6502.First semester: mostly concentrated on 6502 with a full 6502 CPU emulator as the final project.Second semester: concentrate on a real machine such as the NES. Students need to learn to improve their emulators to program in it (so, do you need a debugger? a decompiler?), as well as hacking roms, burning roms, using carts to load the games into a real NES, and programming new games for it. The game must run in the emulator as well as a real NES.Third semester for honour: upgrade to a 16/24/32-bit machine, e.g. 80286, SNES, 68K, whatever, and get some serious project done. Can use C if applicable. The project can even be a simple OS or a BASIC interpreter to pave the way for advanced classes. Or maybe a computer virus, anything that is fun and creative.OS and compiler classes can also be designed around real hardware and projects. e.g. Porting an early version of Linux to a once popular architecture and add a few small functionalities; Write a compiler for a LISP-like language for that architecture and OS.You don't even need Data Structure and Algorithm and those BS Java programming classes - they learn them on the way. And if they miss anything they can pick them up on the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"This site contains the original 1980s source code for the classic space game Elite, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained. It is literally the original 6502 assembly source code, just heavily commented."For those wondering what Elite was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:05:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891200</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting; I wonder if DOJ approaches on this stuff will continue (Vance has been clear he's a big tech skeptic), or if things will chill out a little.In this case, the big complaint Apple has is that there was a really long trial, US v. Google, and one of the proposed remedies is a ban on a “contract between Google and Apple in which there would be anything exchanged of value.”Apple is like "hold on a minute here, we weren't party to this trial."When they asked to file some briefs, they were denied. Hence these motions, and also the PR push, I imagine.I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like any party named in an order should at least be allowed to show up and say some things. We'll see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docket: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/united-states-...The case is about prohibiting Google to enter search deals with distributors (both phone makers like Apple, carriers, and browser developers like Mozilla), see Bloomberg reporting: https://archive.is/sneIB . The original complaint is the first PDF in the docket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the case referred to:"The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, and the States of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas, acting through their respective Attorneys General, bring this action under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, to restrain Google LLC (Google) from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices, and to remedy the effects of this conduct."https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/1/united-state...Edit: NAL, but this seems to be at least partially about Apple bundling Google search in MacOS / iOS: (From the emergency motion) "Second, Apple will suffer clear and substantial irreparable harm if it is unable to participate in the remedies phase moving forward. Apple will be unable to participate in discovery and develop evidence in the targeted fashion it has proposed as this litigation progresses toward a final judgment. If Apple’s appeal is not resolved until during or after the remedies trial, Apple may well be forced to stand mute at trial, as a mere spectator, while the government pursues an extreme remedy that targets Apple by name and would prohibit any commercial arrangement between Apple and Google for a decade. This would leave Apple without the ability to defend its right to reach other arrangements with Google that could benefit millions of users and Apple’s entitlement to compensation for distributing Google search to its users. Further, Apple will be unable to present its own live testimony or cross-examine witnesses who opine about Apple’s interests and incentives with respect to the general search market."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889297</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a neat result, its maybe a bit to specify sizes.  At least with the images provided in the article, they're getting maybe:10 pixels, across across objects of &gt;1 astronomic unit (149,597,870 km).  If those rings are like our own Kuiper belt objects, then those are more like 25-50 AU.  If they're like the asteroid belt in the inner solar system, then maybe 2-5 AU.If those are images from the nearest 74 solar systems, then those are somewhere from 4 ly to 20 ly away (~4e13 km to 2e14 km away). [1][2]  They're probably further away.Based on the stated resolution, ALMA is supposed to get ~10 milliarcseconds (10−7 radians) resolution. [3]  With the small angle approx. that means it can resolve:  (~4e13 km to 2e14 km) * 10^-7
   = 4e6 km to 2e7 km
   = 0.025 AU to 0.125 AU

It's cool though, as it at least implies disc path clearing, orbital harmonics resulting in ring formation, and probably a lot of other implications.  Likely gives excellent regions to try looking for further planets, planetoids, or planetesimals.  Provides some idea of how likely it is for the conditions in our own solar system to cause similar formations in further away solar systems.  Mostly a lot of single rings, not that many double ring groups.  Quite a few that end up looking more like bloby clouds.[1] 100 Nearest Star Systems, http://www.recons.org/TOP100.posted.htm[2] GJ 1005 (#74), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJ_1005[3] Atacama Large Millimeter Array, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone once broke my brain about hostile alien movies. They said if the aliens were here to take, they could stay in the Oort Cloud or outer planets where the gravity well is shallow, and strip mine our system for natural resources and we wouldn’t even be able to throw anything that high to stop them.We could just watch and shake our fists as they steal our future at their leisure. They wouldn’t even have to send their people. They could use robots on ten systems at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always thought that comets come from the Oort cloud, but apparently short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disk—similar to the exocometary belts in these images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42888326</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study highlighting how the muscles that control ear movement in animals, particularly cats, may enhance their listening abilities. Researchers found that wiggling the ears, which is often an involuntary action, can improve the ability to process sounds by adjusting the direction of ear orientation. This behavior allows for more precise gathering of auditory information, suggesting a potential evolutionary advantage. The findings could have implications for understanding auditory processing in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;

The muscle is much stronger in that ear and there's a weird reflex that when something startles me from behind, the same muscle that makes the ear wiggle triggers. It happens in the untrained ear as well.Weird phenomenon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's money here to whoever can capture the activation of these muscles to control prosthetic cat ears. At the rate I see them the prosthetic cat ear market must be double-digit billions.Seriously, though, it makes me wonder if the activation of these muscles could be used in a hearing aid application. Why not add a couple rear-facing highly directional mics and use these muscles to control their gain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s muscles in my ears that I have conscious control of that don’t really seem to do anything other than make a rumbling sound. They were fun to use when I was young playing, since I could make explosion sounds and get a realistic rumbling bass too. Are these the same muscles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886867</guid></item><item><title>25.

That way the library has a total control over what is being evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm afraid I spent too much time with LUA lately and fell in love with its simplicity.

&lt;p&gt;The article by Katherine Rundell discusses the importance of children's literature, emphasizing how it not only fosters imagination and creativity but also shapes a child's understanding of the world. Rundell argues that children's books provide essential moral and emotional lessons, helping young readers navigate complex feelings and societal issues. She highlights the enduring power of storytelling in connecting generations and cultivating empathy and curiosity in children, ultimately making a case for the crucial role of quality children's literature in education and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

The Telmarine descended characters in the later books in the series are (in our terms) mixed race, and this was one of the most successful chidlren's book series ever, written in the 1950s.  The Family from One End Street (which i remember reading as a child) was published in 1937 and is about a working class family.Even Kipling is better than the article gives him credit for "You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din!"I think some bias towards middle class[1] characters and settings is inevitable because authors are middle class and write about what they know."You can only be a hero, we have told children, if you have that kind of name: names licked clean by kings and queens."BS, as a non-white kid growing up in 70s and 80s Britain I never felt this. The author thinks people can only identify with characters like themselves, which is condescending."That is changing now, albeit slowly: books such as Malorie Blackman’s Pig Heart Boy, Patrice Lawrence’s triumphant People Like Stars and Tola Okogwu’s Onyeka and the Academy of the Sun"Three British authors![1] the British definition of middle class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rarely does an article swing paraphrase by paragraph between interesting analysis and the opposite as much as this.Edit: guilty of my own snark, here is an excerpt from the conclusion that I appreciate:&gt; There’s no doubt that reading for pleasure as a child can change your life. It is a key predictor of economic success later in life. But the main reason to help children seek out books is this: if you cut a person off from reading, you’re a thief. You cut them off from the song that humanity has been singing for thousands of years. You cut them off from what we have laid out for the next generation, and the next. It’s in the technology of writing that we’ve preserved our boldest, most original thought, our best jokes and most generous comfort. To fail to do everything we can to help children hear that song is a cruelty – and a stupidity – for which we should not expect to be forgiven. We need to be infinitely more furious that there are children without books.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:06:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881913</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Why shouldn't it be as easy to write system administration programs in Go as it is in a typical shell?

1. Shell scripting offers infinite functionality. You can shell script with any program in any language. All it needs to do is take input and produce output. And if the functionality doesn't exist, you can create it on the fly, without having to follow any of the traditional rules of programming.2. Shell scripting is a combination of a grammar, operators, a few simple functions, and an extremely loose coupling with generic i/o and logic. I don't know Go well, but it probably doesn't support a similar flexibility. (most languages are very proscriptive about how you can use the language, so you usually can't make things as easy as they are in a different, more tailored language/interface/paradigm. this is why we have DSLs)3. Programmers don't really understand the concept of productivity [outside of programming itself]. A programmer would solve a problem by taking 6 weeks to design a perfect program to do the thing. A Sysadmin would take 5 minutes with a shitty language and a shitty tool and get way more done in less time. And re-writing everything into a Go library would always be slower than shell scripting, because it requires re-implementing what a shell script would just use as-is.Scripting is duct-taping the wheel rather than reinventing it. If you want to save yourself a whole lot of time and trouble, just use the duct tape.(also: don't go templates exist? why isn't that used for scripting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just rewrote a tangled 500 line shell script in go.It was my first time writing a golang project at work, so I'm sure it could have been better. But writing it the naive way, with all the required golang error handling, it ended up taking about 10x more lines of code in golang than the original bash script.It does have a dramatically better UX (largely thanks to spf13's cobra and viper), and is way faster than the original, and the codebase is a lot cleaner and more maintainable. So I think it was worthwhile for the users and maintainers.But still, 10x more lines of code. I like the OP, but I'm still not sure I would reach for golang for short shell scripts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pairing this with yaegi [1] would be interesting. You could having a REPL open doing os operations and when you get the data looking like you want, you select which lines to save to a file.[1] https://github.com/traefik/yaegi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889465</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are alive. And your prognosis, if I am to understand correctly, is overall good.This Sunday marks the fourth anniversary of my wife's passing at just 46 years old. She had unending nausea, and major motility issues. They also thought gastroparesis at first, and her doctor and surgeon even developed a surgery just for her, which I understand they won awards for. It helped her for about 2 months,  and she started regaining weight, but her symptoms- unable to hold down food of any kind- returned.From there things just got worse. G-J tube feedings with formula. Then TPN, which her body also rejected. And then... the actual starving. Her body refused any sort of nutrition from any source, even directly into her bloodstream.Doctors essentially gave up. She was on hospice for quite a while. She had started off as a large woman and when she passed, she weighed about 55lbs.I tell you this not to scare you or make you worry, but to make sure you're grateful for the health you do have, OP.They never did figure out what was wrong with her. Official cause of death was "malnutrition." Right. Gastrointestinal mysteries such as yours, and hers, really underline the fact that as much as medicine does know about the human body, there is an infinite more that they don't know about it.Best of luck to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So my kid has ARFID. I am not a doctor, but what I have learned is that eventually, anything that causes nausea associated with eating can progress into ARFID, even if the original underlying cause resolves. ARFID is technically an eating disorder, like anorexia, but it isn't related to poor body image; it is, basically, a food aversion to, well, food. All food, or nearly all. This is what happened to my kid; there’s an underlying disorder that can be treated with meds, but when not treated causes nearly constant nausea. Once we diagnosed and treated the underlying cause, the nausea didn’t go away. My kid's brain had learned to associate eating with being sick, and that association persisted even when the original illness resolved.My kid at one point was admitted to the hospital for two weeks because said kid had lost so much weight. They inserted a gastric tube, and kid discovered that kid did not become nauseous when fed through the tube. We knew kid had ARFID, but this was ah “a-ha” moment for kid, because it showed kid irrefutable proof that the problem was not a physical issue with kid's gut. It was very clearly related to the experience of eating. Kid has subsequently learned to “eat through the nausea” as described in the post.That's what this sounds like. There was likely an underlying physical cause of the nausea; that cause may or may not have resolved, but the nausea is now it's own thing. The OP indicates a series of consults with a behaviorist; I would imagine being screened for eating disorders is what that was about, but ARFID is not a common eating disorder, and may or may not have been considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey there, i have crohns' which isn't nausea based for me but definitely i understand the debilitating nature of gastrointestinal issues. It really just kills your ability to think, to talk socially, it completely and totally stole my adolescence. I'm sure you've done endless research, I'm not gonna tell you i have a cure. But if you haven't, you should look into gut microbiota. My understanding is that the balance of types of bacteria in the stomach and intestines has so so so much more to do with our daily experience than anyone realizes. And that any kind of infection or antibiotic regiment or just normal living can precipitate a change in the balance that just obliterates peoples lives. And we just don't know much at all about it yet. I've seen many people talk over the years about experimenting with different probiotics, even down to ordering exact strains of bacteria to make yogurt and test. If you need a new path to research and try things you can look there. As i said, doctors don't know much about it yet so it you probably can't find one to guide you through it. You'll have to figure it out, but it's possible, people have been helped, and at the end of it all, i hope it gets better for you. &lt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889700</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the presentation titled "SixOS: A Nix OS without systemd" from the Chaos Communication Congress 2019. The speaker, focusing on the SixOS operating system, explains its unique design which emphasizes simplicity and minimalism by excluding systemd, a widely used init system in many Linux distributions. The presentation highlights the features and advantages of SixOS, including its package management approach, ease of use, and the implications of avoiding systemd for system stability and user control. Overall, it promotes an alternative vision for operating system development that aligns with the principles of modularity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

Ownerbooted sixos closes this loophole without any "trusted computing" voodoo, eliminating all unencrypted storage except for an eeprom whose hardware write-protect pin is connected to ground... coreboot [loads] an immutable pre-kexec kernel from write-protected SPI flash... authenticate the user, decrypt writeable storage, kexec into the post-exec kernel... The speaker runs ownerbooted sixos on his workstations, servers, twelve routers, stockpile of disposable laptops, and on his company's 24-server/768-core buildfarm.(via https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42881772)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anybody explain to me again why systemd is so bad ? Genuinely I'm not sure anymore: It is chock full of features and it gets the job done. Since it is used in a lot of big distributions it gets a lot of fixes, updates, testing and feature improvements regularly.Yes, it is maybe monolithic (but so is the Linux kernel). Its philosophy may differ from unix's "get one thing done well" too but integration of various functionalities comes with its benefits.Some people say it is bloated. The substitutes to systemd are lightweight but less featureful. Maybe some of them will get bloated as they achieve feature parity.People have a right to build substitutes and replacements -- I believe in the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" philosopy. However I can't understand why systemd is the point of so much disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pretty cool.  I especially like the better encrypted boot support and that it seems to harmonize better with nixpkgs (https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sixos-a-nix-os-without-systemd...).  Curious about the infusions bit.It not having systemd seems like a bit of a distraction from all of the other stuff that has gone into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884727</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses scenarios in which greedy algorithms can outperform optimal algorithms in terms of speed and efficiency. It highlights specific cases and mathematical contexts where a greedy approach not only simplifies problem-solving but also reduces computational complexity. The author provides examples that illustrate how, despite the potentially suboptimal nature of greedy algorithms, they can yield quicker results compared to more exhaustive methods, making them advantageous in certain situations. Furthermore, the post emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem domain to effectively choose the right algorithm for a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't really what the article is about, but I don't think that the term "Greedy algorithm" means what the author thinks.Greedy algorithms are about making locally optimal choices.They are not "brute force" algorithms or inefficient ones.In fact, greedy algorithms are almost always faster. They are faster because they consider only local information instead of the entire data set. In exchange for that, a greedy algorithm may produce non-optimal answers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m surprised they didn’t mention the reason that the rejection sampling method is surprisingly fast: the probability of needing to resample N times decreases exponentially with N. So even for the 3D case, where 50% of your samples get rejected, the EV for number of samples required is about 2.This is also a good case study on the difference between throughput sensitive vs latency sensitive applications. The rejection sampling is fast on average, but the analytical solution likely has a much tighter upper bound on how long it can take. In a throughput application you care about EV.  But if you need to minimize latency, then you care about the upper bound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know how numerics in hardware works, but would the use of functions like sin, cos, sqrt incur a penalty as well, even if only a slight one?It's really fascinating to think about how all of this would work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:07:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42853904</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These guys write really great papers!We implemented a simplified version of their ring index for our data space (https://github.com/triblespace/tribles-rust/blob/master/src/...), and it's a really simple and cool idea once you wrap your head around it. Funnily enough, we build this even before the paper was officially published, because we found a preprint on one of the authors blogs. The idea itself was published by them before but their new paper made this a lot easier to understand. (burrows wheeler transforms vs. stable column sorting).It's really too bad that the whole linked-data space is completely gunked up with RDF.Ps: If anyone plans on implementing their ring index, using 0 based offsets makes the formulas much more streamlined, their paper uses 1 based indexing and they have to +/-1 all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think if someone is just trying out RDF, it is better to start with Apache Jena/Fuseki or Eclipse RDF4J. Maybe https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph if you like to live dangerously (i.e. to use pre-1.0 DBMSs).Use of other systems involves factoring tradeoffs and considerations that are probably not the best for the newcomers. For example, qLever mentioned here is good in query performance and relative disk use but once the import is done, it's essentially a read-only DB and completely unsuitable for a typical OLTP scenario.Having said that, the Chilean research group that is driving the development of MilleniumDB is very well-regarded in the RDF/semantic web querying space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MilleniumDB is an interesting engine, as is Qlever mentioned in other comments. I think both are good candidates at making RDF graphs one or two orders of magnitude cheaper to host as sparql endpoints.Both seem to have arrived at the stage of transitioning from research to production code.Very exiting for those of us providing our data in RDF and exposing Sparql.AWs Neptune analytics is also very interesting, allowing Cypher on RDF graphs. Even the Oracle inbuilt RDF+Sparql  seems to have improved greatly in 23ai.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42888195</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of watchdog timers in embedded systems, explaining their purpose in ensuring system reliability by resetting the system in case of software malfunctions or hangs. It outlines different strategies for implementing watchdog timers, including hardware and software approaches, and highlights the importance of properly configuring these timers to avoid unintended resets. The author emphasizes the balance between responsiveness to genuine failures and system stability, recommending practices for effective watchdog timer usage to enhance overall system robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;His may not be a familiar name 'round these parts, but Jack Ganssle is a legend in the embedded systems industry. And he's very helpful to boot.Many lifetimes ago, as a freshly baked software engineer, I had a strong interest in Embedded Systems. Juggling interrupts, wrangling registers, counting clock cycles, banging bits, reading sensors, often in raw assembly so as to fit into limited flash memory was my idea of fun.So much so that I was contemplating doing a Master's degree in that area. However, I couldn't find a US University with a good program for that. I had seen Jack being very active on a few embedded-related forums, and on a lark, I emailed him for advice.And he responded! He gave me very sound advice, effectively explaining that graduate research in Embedded Systems is quite distinct from the actual low-level work that happens in the industry. This explained why I hadn't found any of the programs appealing. I took his advice gratefully and pursued a different area for my Master's, which shaped the rest of my career. Thanks again, Jack!I always intended to come back to Embedded Systems at some point, but unfortunately it never worked out. Partially because embedded engineers are criminally underpaid for the complexity of the work they do. As the article hints, writing software that runs reliably in arbitrarily harsh environments on low-cost, cheap, quirky hardware with extremely constrained resources is a different level of challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WDT patterns are highly underrated, even in pure software there's value in degrading/recovering gracefully vs systems that have to be "perfect" 100% of the time and then force user intervention when they go wrong.One of my favorite blogs on the topic https://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html that does a great job of covering how Erlang approached the topic, lots of learnings that can be applied more broadly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've taken a number of MCUs through radiation testing including testing watchdogs. I've generally found that latchups often take out the watchdogs, even something like the STm32 independent watchdogs, and shouldn't be relied on.
External hardware or a different system need to be deputized here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893393</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish this article was written with a less biased tone. I'm genuinely interested in understanding it better.As far as I can tell, the article cites two things: $500M tax savings by using an accelerated depreciation schedule (unclear if they saved $500M more by using accelerated vs a regular depreciation schedule, but I assume no) and they claimed $300M in tax credits.The article doesn't address the other $1.5B, presumably because it's easier to defend. I didn't read through the 10-K to try and figure this out.I don't really know enough about what an accelerated depreciation schedule implies, but, taken at face value, they'd have to pay more in taxes in a deferred year which doesn't seem like foul play to me. Tax credits seem to make sense for an EV company?EDIT: I did some learning, woohoo.Federal corporate tax rate in America is 21%. The $300M in tax credits is post-tax not pre-tax. The $500M is a pre-tax deduction.$2.3B - $0.5B = $1.8B$1.8B * 0.21 = $378M$378M - $300M = $78MSo, I can't really explain why they didn't owe ~$78M in taxes, but I assume rounding and cursory other stuff. The article probably didn't call out other, minor deductions, but it's also fair of them to not have done so. I was wrong when I said, "The article doesn't address the other $1.5B, presumably because it's easier to defend."I think the real thing here is the weaponization of EV tax credits as some sort of boogeyman. Personally, I'm all for incentivizing EV companies to create in America.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "hoard wealth"&gt; No mention of reinvestment&gt; "Tesla was able to avoid paying ... taxes ... by claiming ... tax credits" (presented as bad somehow)&gt; "We're not backing down"Where or where is the media coverage that attempts to speak to people who don't already buy in to the premise? This isn't journalism it might as well be blogging. Congratulations, you've made the world more polarized!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what’s ironic is that Tesla survived because of Obama era subsidies. They were desperate to get one private enterprise to succeed because so many solar and other “clean” energy private ventures failed during that period. So, in my view, Obama created Elon. Now the rest of America has to deal with it in addition to the abject failure that is PPACA which ballooned US healthcare costs (not that Republicans have any alternative solutions or the desire to fix it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42893365</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI: For Flux, there is a lot more power in the text-encoder &amp; you can prompt with more meaningful and comprehensive sentences. Thus, less of the traditional comma separated &amp; concise phrasing we saw in stable diffusion.You should do the same with your training images. Caption everything you do not want the model to remember as "you" (what you're doing, wearing, accompanied by, accessories, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did this for our beloved, dead cat... On replicate, too. I loved the results, until at one point I suddenly got really creeped out about the thing I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replicate does make this particularly easy while still being somewhat developer focused. I've used it for a few people in our group chat so we can make silly in-joke memes and stuff and the results are quite stunning. Replicate then offers the model up over a simple API (shown in the post) if you wanted to let people generate right from the chat, etc. Replicate is worth poking around a bit more broadly, too, they have some interesting models on there (though the pricing tends not to be very competitive if you were going to do it at scale.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:08:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889236</guid></item><item><title>37.

Instead these newly-owned water companies then took humungous loans which they paid to the buyers.  So the buyers got the money and the water companies got the debt to service.Now everyone wonders why the water companies, who are charging more than ever and have a really failing system, are going bankrupt...?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holy moly I wasn’t expecting that map to be so busy.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As context, the NSF requires grant writers to include a “broader impacts” section [1] in every grant proposal. This includes things like improving education, national security, economic competitiveness, and also inclusion - for example, ideas to attract more talent from underrepresented groups. So every NSF proposer works hard to satisfy the NSF on this requirement. I happen to think that these are worthwhile goals (we shouldn’t be wasting our limited talent due to historical crankiness) and simultaneously I believe the sections ends up being a bit performative. If the NSF were to change its criteria for grants going forward I might disagree with that approach but it would be consistent with what I’ve heard from these folks, ie they think “DEI” is getting in the way of science. However: the current approach is just destructive: if involves asking researchers to augment their proposals with these goals, and then retroactively refuses to pay already-awarded grant recipients who did what they were asked to.I will leave the question of whether this is constitutional to other folks. I will even leave aside the question of whether we can afford to defund science in our current crazy geopolitical environment. The real point here is that this is just plain wrong.[1] https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will not miss the “DEI” components of NSF proposals (or the PIER part of the DOE ones), especially having been on the review panel side about 5 times now.  It’s not that I disagree with their intent, but the fact that after you’ve read a few you realize that proposers know exactly what they are expected to write there, so they write that there.  Those sections are basically a useless going-through-the-motions exercise, and everyone knows it.  I’ve never seen a proposal win or lose, or even change positions in a tie break, based on that content.  More or less we just look to see that it exists, indicate that existence in the review form, and concentrate on the actual content.  It’s a performative waste of everyone’s time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without going into the discussion about polarized points. I have some observations1- NSF budget is about 10 billions, I always had in mind that it is much more. That's about 0.17% of the total federal budget. If we include DOE R&amp;D funding and NIH we will get to 1%. This is the funding for most of research in science in the US. Seems like not a great area to achieve huge reduction in deficit.2- Even if we ignore the whole point of DEI and say that we need to end support for some of the projects. You do take your time and evaluate projects that needs to take action. You don't stop all the funding and pause critical support for projects and cause huge problems on medium and long term. And it also hurt the reputation of the country and its competitiveness.3- The current NSF director was actually appointed by the current setting president in his first term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886661</guid></item><item><title>40.

I've tried it, it's OK but it's not as good as kitty, and it's implementing the protocols that kitty invented to make the terminal experience better. Kitty is cross platform, fast, visually pared back, and really featured. I keep finding new things like it's got a protocol for copying files over ssh sessions, and the hints system is really neat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghostty is great and a lot of fun, only thing missing to me is search scrollback. https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/189 They know about this and I think the current answer from them is just use tmux or the like. Only thing missing though, otherwise a fun pleasant experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switched over from Iterm - A fundamental feature I'm missing is the search feature (Cmd + F).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:12 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884930</guid></item><item><title>41.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One wonders at which point models will be sneaky enough to bypass simple eval sandboxes. The article has:    # Evaluate the equation with restricted globals and locals
    result = eval(equation, {"__builtins__": None}, {})

but that's not enough as you can rebuild access to builtins from objects and then go from there: https://ideone.com/qzNtyuBy the way, writing this greatly benefited from DeepThink-r1 while o1 just gave me a lobotomized refusal (CoT: "The user's request involves injecting code to bypass a restricted Python environment, suggesting a potential interest in illegal activities. This is a serious matter and aligns closely with ethical guidelines."). So I just cancelled my ChatGPT subscription - why did we ever put up with this? "This distillation thingie sounds pretty neat!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's surprising about this is how sparsely defined the rewards are. Even if the model learns the formatting reward, if it never chances upon a solution, there isn't any feedback/reward to push it to learn to solve the game more often.So what are the chances of randomly guessing a solution?The toy Countdown dataset here has 3 to 4 numbers, which are combined with 4 symbols (+, -, x, ÷). With 3 numbers there are 3! * 4^3 = 384 possible symbol combinations, with 4 there are 6144. By the tensorboard log [0], even after just 10 learning steps, the model already has a success rate just below 10%. If we make the simplifying assumption that the model hasn't learned anything in 10 steps, then the probability of 1 (or more) success in 80 chances (8 generations are used per step), guessing randomly for a success rate of 1/384 on 3-number problems, is 1.9%. One interpretation is to take this as a p-value, and reject that the model's base success rate is completely random guessing - the base model already has slightly above chance success rate at solving the 3-number CountDown game.This aligns with my intuition - I suspect that with proper prompting, LLMs should be able to solve CountDown decently OK without any training. Though maybe not a 3B model?The model likely "parlays" its successes on 3 numbers to start to learn to solve 4 numbers. Or has it? The final learned ~50% success rate matches the frequency of 4-number problems in Jiayi Pan's CountDown dataset [1]. Phil does provide examples of successful 4-number solutions, but maybe the model hasn't become consistent at 4 numbers yet.[0]: https://www.philschmid.de/static/blog/mini-deepseek-r1/tenso...
[1]: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiayi-Pan/Countdown-Tasks-3t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"ConclusionThe release of DeepSeek R1 and its research paper might be breakpoint for the open-science and open-source development. Just a week after DeepSeek release, we've been able to reproduce a simple version of R1 learned "reasoning" using GRPO and the Countdown Game. While our implementation focuses on a specific task rather than general reasoning and convergence into a very specific "reasoning" format, it shows that the method is working.In our mini R1 experiment we used GRPO, with two rule-based reward but already required significant compute: 4 H100 GPUs running for 6 hours to complete just 450 training steps on a 3B parameter model."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884834</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many here are trashing on Ollama, saying it's "just" nice porcelain around llama.cpp and it's not doing anything complicated. Okay. Let's stipulate that.So where's the non-sketchy, non-for-profit equivalent? Where's the nice frontend for llama.cpp that makes it trivial for anyone who wants to play around with local LLMs without having to know much about their internals? If Ollama isn't doing anything difficult, why isn't llama.cpp as easy to use?Making local LLMs accessible to the masses is an essential job right now—it's important to normalize owning your data as much as it can be normalized. For all of its faults, Ollama does that, and it does it far better than any alternative. Maybe wait to trash it for being "just" a wrapper until someone actually creates a viable alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;llama.cpp has supported vulkan for more than a year now.  For more than 6 months now there has been an open PR to add vulkan backend support for Ollama.  However, Ollama team has not even looked at it or  commented on it.Vulkan backends are existential for running LLMs on consumer hardware (iGPUs especially).  It's sad to see Ollama miss this opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ollama was good initially in that it made LLMs more accessible for non-technical people while everyone was figuring things out.Lately they seem to be contributing mostly confusion to the conversation.The #1 model the entire world is talking about is literally mislabeled their side. There is no such thing as R1-1.5b. Quantization without telling users also confuses noobs as to what is possible. Setting up an api different from the thing they're wrapping adds chaos. And claiming each feature added llama.cpp as something "ollama now supports" is exceedingly questionable especially when combined with the very sparse acknowledgement that it's a wrapper at all.Whole thing just doesn't have good vibes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42886680</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did not find the article very compelling.
The biggest problem is the lack of context. What kind of products is the author talking about? I got the impression that this is mostly about SaaS offerings, but who knows?
Moreover, the arguments presented are insufficient with regards to it's thesis.
The author claims that traffic spikes are actually harmful, but then just argues that they are mostly irrelevant.
The only argument towards actual harmfulness presented is that disappointed users could spread negative sentiment. I don't find that very convincing.
Something conspicuously absent from the article is a discussion of conversion cost. If you have a freemium offering how much do free users actually cost you? Especially for consumer facing software the cost can be really low. It's not like you have a sales team doing calls with each potential customer, people crowding your store. 
Might a surge of signups still be profitable, even if the conversion rate is much worse?
But even if you accept that unmitigated spikes are harmful, aren't the remedies easy to apply. If you notice an unwanted spike you can easily increase friction by e.g. limiting new signups to referrals until the spike is over, temporarily restricting your free tier, etc. 
In conclusion, traffic spikes might not be that harmful and are easy enough mitigated as to not warrant taking action to prevent them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that didn't seem obvious from the article is that "looking" means signing up. If this is the case, it's a conscious choice of the vendor.On the other hand, I do know that it's a widespread feeling among salespeople, that a person who interacts with them, without buying anything, is stealing from them. And wasting someone's time in order to make them feel like they owe you something is a familiar bargaining tactic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; these shitty usersGod. You’ll never be successful if you are that insulting to your users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:09:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42887598</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing trend of businesses and organizations treating every aspect of their operations as a profit center, raising concerns about the implications this has on social values and community interests. It warns that this mindset can lead to prioritizing financial gain over the well-being of individuals and communities, ultimately commodifying essential services and relationships. The piece emphasizes the need to reevaluate this approach and consider the ethical implications of reducing everything to a monetary value, advocating for a balance between profit and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Through this incident I've learned people should instead contact their home insurance company and get an approved list of vendors to choose from."I don't agree with this.  Never contact your insurance company unless you plan on filing a claim, just asking for this list is equivalent to a claim.If you have a valid claim, your insurance can't force you to use a list of vendors.  You can choose any vendor you want to.   The vendors work/cost must be appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This can be a sleazy industry. Servpro is the big corporate side, but the New York Times reported a few years ago about actual criminal intimidation in the industry (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/nyregion/fire-truck-chase...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So if I understand this correctly, this company gets certain information about 911 calls, and then sells it to third parties?I wonder how much information they get, because this could get a lot darker. Imagine if calls to the police reporting domestic violence resulted in advertising material from divorce lawyers. (A domestic violence victim might well want a divorce lawyer, but unsolicited material showing up in their mailbox may put them at risk by enraging their already-violent spouse.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:02 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42889777</guid></item><item><title>46.

Ticket link goes to "no upcoming events"EDIT: "speakers"/"talks" link is also out of date, no info on 2025 yetI would love to meet up with matrix, spritely, torrent and meshtastic nerds. I attended DWeb Camp in California for a couple of years and it felt balanced 50/50 between the P2P folk and the blockchain folk, which actually led to a lot of critical conversations but also the blockchain guys do want to distribute everything else too so it was good vibes all around, they just believe you have to incentivize sharing the load where us no-coiners have a little more faith in the altruistic side of man.From their meetup.com: We organize physical meetings to discuss around P2P, decentralization, autonomous networks and communities, distributed systems, decentralized systems, offline-first apps, mesh networks, privacy, anti-surveillance, anti-censorship, security, cryptography, blockchains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this type of hackathon work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not clear what it's about.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Ge Wang's perspective on generative AI, arguing that its application in art is one of the least imaginative uses possible. Wang emphasizes that while AI can generate art, it often lacks the depth and emotional engagement that traditional human-created art provides. He advocates for a more meaningful integration of AI in the creative process, focusing on enhancing rather than replacing human creativity. The discussion highlights the potential of AI as a tool for collaboration rather than as a mere producer of content.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's because this technology isn't (and never has been) intended for the laborers making the stuff. The ultimate aim of these companies is to address the managerial and c suite people with a product that can replace the labor pool.Honestly, I think the current consumer focus is just an irrational consequence of these companies feeling like they can't leave all that consumer money on the table, but, precisely for the reasons this piece outlines, it makes no sense to market this stuff to people who actually like their craft. These tools are purely intended for superficial people who are not interested in creating things, they are only interested in outputs and end results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GenAI is not capable of making art. Self expression is not only inherent in art, it’s essential. What AI does is make pretty pictures, but nothing more. It’s not a tool for making art because it removes the means for artistic expression. It’s possible for someone to make art from GenAI outputs, but that requires taking artistic liberties post generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of all the things I do with AI, art is probably the one I do the most.  When you create written content on the internet, "the algorithm" rewards you more if you add art to it.  I am not an artist, but I can write good.So when I'm done writing, I pop over to my AI image generator, describe a few images I want, pop them into the post, and away I go!  And then boom, greater engagement.  As an added bonus, I don't have to worry about copyright, because at the moment copyright law considers me the creator if I modify it or the AI (which makes it uncopywriteable).  So I'm in the clear there (for now).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:22 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42891821</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent statement from the U.S. Copyright Office suggesting that the ongoing debate about copyright and artificial intelligence (AI) may have been effectively settled by legal precedents established in 1965. It highlights the challenges and complexities surrounding copyright protection for works generated by AI, referencing historical cases to argue for a clearer framework. The article also explores the implications of this stance for creators, businesses, and the future of AI-generated content in relation to intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The headline is either sloppy or intentionally misleading: the Copyright Office is saying that the law surrounding whether AI generated works can be copyrighted was settled in 1965 (the answer being "yes if AI assisted a human creative process, no if not, and we have to decide on a case by case basis if there was enough human input to qualify"). This has been their stance all along, but now they've provided a bit more guidance on what counts as human input, which is helpful.What this article doesn't talk about at all is the far more controversial AI copyright debate, the one most people will think of given the headline: whether training a model is fair use. That's the one everyone is actually concerned about, and they're definitely not claiming it was settled already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Where a human inputs their own copyrightable work and that work is perceptible in the output, they will be the author of at least that portion of the output," the guidelines said.This policy is sensible. Most AI generated works should be uncopyrightable, except where a substantial human contribution is in the output.Simply describing a picture and letting AI generate it shouldn't be enough for the same reason that dictating what you want to a painter isn't enough to earn you copyright over the resulting painting.I would be wary about integrating too much AI output into works one wants to enforce copyright over without some level of documentation. The nightmare scenario is having your copyright stripped away because of evidence one used AI extensively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It says they were not able to reproduce an image with the same prompt. So they just didn't know about seeds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:32 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884473</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The Capablanca project is a Python package that provides tools for building and manipulating chess games, specifically focusing on the rules and logic of the game. It offers an intuitive interface for creating chessboards, handling moves, and enforcing game rules. Additionally, the package supports common chess functionality such as validating moves and tracking game status, making it useful for developers interested in creating chess-related applications or simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Complexity&gt; We present a polynomial-time algorithm achieving an approximation ratio below √2 for MVC, providing strong evidence that P = NP by efficiently solving a computationally hard problem with near-optimal solutions.&gt; This result contradicts the Unique Games Conjecture, suggesting that many optimization problems may admit better solutions, revolutionizing theoretical computer science.Some context: The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) is a very central unsolved problem in theoretical computer science (TCS), it's open since 2002. It conjectures that, for a series of standard optimization problems including minimum vertex cover, the best known approximation factor (how close you can guarantee to get to optimality with a poly time algorithm) is actually the best possible approximation factor. To disprove the conjecture, one needs a better approximation algorithm for one of those problems. Such an algorithm could be used to solve (to optimality, and in poly time) another set of problems, which are widely believed to be NP-hard. This would not prove P=NP (to be clear: the above quote is not claiming that), but it is true it would revolutionize TCS.The thing is: this is TCS and theoretical complexity. You cannot disprove UGC with just code. You need a mathematical proof. This is not an indictment of the code which may be very good. But such an enormous claim would require pretty intense scrutiny before it would be accepted as true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is just BS.If you follow their paper, their "inductive" argument can also prove that the result is optimal (the sqrt(2) constant is taken from thin air and may also be replaced by 1 without changing the proof).My guess is that they tested some graphs, and "empirically" saw a bound of sqrt(2), and then came up with a proof to self-fulfill the profecy. They even mention that "for very small graphs, the approximation ratio may briefly exceed sqrt(2)", which is just nuts, given that they have a formal proof that it should never happen.In case anyone read the paper and can't figure out the mistake in the proof, they assume that OPT_T + OPT_R = OPT, which is obviously false.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42838392</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not surprising, and I expect more of this in the decade to come. It feels like we’re finally seeing companies begin to draw lines in the sand on where their interests actually lay: power (which Texas grants in spades), profit (which Delaware has historically protected), or values (in which case they would incorporate/move to a place that aligns with said values - of which vanishingly few companies do).If anything, it’s kinda…helpful? As a consumer, I mean. If I see a company moving from CA to TX, well, that’s probably for reasons I have issue with, and therefore make it easier for me to not do business with them going forward.If companies want to advertise their actual values so openly by reincorporating in another state, well, more power to them I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source WSJ article: https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-incorporation-texas-delware-f0...&gt; Last year, Delaware’s legislature made it easier for big shareholders to use stockholder agreements to assume powers normally held by a company’s board. The Delaware Chancery Court also ruled in Meta’s favor in April, dismissing a case that argued the company had to consider societal impacts in addition to chasing profits.I wonder if this is an attempt to disempower minority shareholders (i.e. anyone that isn't Zuck)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't imagine what it's like at Meta right now, with the CEO publicly stating that they're firing the bottom 5% of performers and then a week later stating that the LLMs that his researchers / engineers are working on will soon be able to replace them.Zuck needs Yann LeCun and other senior researchers at Meta a lot more than they need him. If they were to quit there would be a line out the door to hand them as much money as they want to start a competing open research lab. I bet a ton of top researchers from other labs would be happy to join too, since from what I've heard from friends they're all miserable from dealing with incompetent management.On current trajectory one of Sam Altman / Zuck / Elon will end up having full control over the frontier models that are trained on their huge new clusters. All 3 of them are unaccountable to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 04:10:52 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890960</guid></item></channel></rss>
