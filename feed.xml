&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on providing insights and resources related to the concept of "reflective practice" in various contexts, emphasizing its importance for personal and professional development. It likely offers tools, examples, and methodologies to help individuals effectively engage in reflective practices to enhance their learning and growth. The goal is to promote self-awareness and continuous improvement through reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to try this, work through the artithmetic, it’s incredibly easy (and a fun Saturday morning exercise if you’re into this kind of thing) to code up on ShaderToy. From scratch is fun, but if you need a hint to get started I just made one https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mc3cW2 and there are a bunch of super clever text hacks other people have done like this Matrix in less than 300 characters https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llXSzj or green CRT display effect https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtfSD8. Loads of other examples abound if you look around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is delightfully clever and hacky (so basically like every 3d rendering technique ever) but the end result isn't exactly beautiful unless you're trying to recreate an old school electronic billboard. You could improve it by adding more bits, but long before it starts to look good you'd be searching for an easier way to handle setting all the bits... And there's almost certainly no more efficient solution than using black and white pixels in a drawing program then saving the results in a texture. So, full circle.If anyone is interested in the a more common way that modern 3d rendering engines draw text, look up SDF text (and related techniques like MSDF etc.). This uses a traditional texture atlas in a preprossing step to create an atlas of signed distance fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also the option of rendering text as meshes.TextMeshPro goes one step further and uses signed distance fields to handle arbitrary scale.https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:01:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093037</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Delta is a syntax-highlighting pager for git and diff output that enhances the readability of diffs in the terminal. It formats git diff output with color-coded differences, making it easier for users to review changes in code visually. Delta is designed to be customizable, allowing users to adjust colors, styles, and behavior to suit their needs. It also supports various features, such as paging, the ability to show word differences, and integration with tools like GitHub and GitLab. The project is open-source and actively maintained on GitHub, where users can find installation instructions and contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delta has been one of those set and forget things, it's been a while since I've seen 'bare' git grep/diff/blame output, I also use it all the time for normal diffs (outside of git repos), but TIL that it also works with ripgrep [0]As someone else already mentioned there is also bat[1], which was also set and forget, I aliased cat to bat and have a seperate alias vcat for 'vanilla cat' /usr/bin/cat[0] https://dandavison.github.io/delta/grep.html[1] https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a good point made, that has stuck with me over the years. that our syntax highlighters are highlighting the wrong thing.They should not be coloring the grammar, we are good at picking out grammar, they should be highlighting the symbols. each different variable and function name should be getting it's own color. that is, the goal is to make it quicker to distinguish different symbols, not that they are a symbol.But this is much harder than stylizing the grammar so all our tooling sticks with the easy thing rather that the useful thing. Now, I am being a bit mean on grammar styling. It does help quite a bit but I would like to see a symbol matching engine in action to see if that really works.Unfortunately I don't remember where I read the original post and am unable to attribute it correctly.update: while trying to look it up I found this https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2014/09/27/the-definitive-gui...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of diffs, one thing that annoys me about Git's diff output is that is prints file paths like Unix diff traditionally does, starting with the two file names:    --- a/some/path/to/file.c
    +++ b/some/path/to/file.c

I often cmd-click in iTerm to open a file in an editor, but this doesn't work here because of the a/ and b/ prefixes. Any way to make Git format the file name better? I don't even need two lines here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091365</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent developments in research related to gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR, and their potential applications in treating genetic disorders. It highlights breakthroughs made by scientists in refining these tools to enhance precision and reduce off-target effects in gene modification. The piece also examines ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with the use of CRISPR in humans, stressing the need for responsible advancements in the field amidst growing interest from both the scientific community and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolutely metal and the person I would aspire to be.I can't imagine a higher motivation to study and find a cure than to save yourself, with the possible exception of saving a loved one.As other have mentioned, finding a cure for a specific case is easier and has less regulations than finding a general cure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one silver lining of having such a terrible diagnosis should be that you are immediately unbound from normal FDA requirements and are able and try anything in the pipeline that might work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see possible ethical objections, for example if there was a risk that one of these self-ministered viruses was contagious (no idea) that would create scope for harming people.Of if it was a form of embezzlement or something, like there was funding for X and it got used for “treat my own cancer” that would be bad.But TFA seems to say that the ethical problem is “did experiment risky to the patient on myself”, which just seems strictly more ethically clear than “do experiment risky to the patient on other people”, which is a norm, but a regrettable necessity.Did I misread it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094573</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking at the architecture, they will probably run into some issues. We are doing something similar with SemanticDiff [1] and also started out using tree-sitter grammars for parsing and GumTree for matching. Both choices turned out to be problematic.Tree sitter grammars are primarily written to support syntax highlighting and often use a best effort approach to parsing. This is perfectly fine for syntax highlighting, since the worst that can happen is that a few characters are highlighted incorrectly. However, when diffing or modifying code you really want the code to be parsed according to the upstream grammar, not something that mostly resembles it. We are currently in the process of moving away from tree-sitter and instead using the parsers provided by the languages themselves where possible.GumTree is good at returning a result quickly, but there are quite a few cases where it always returned bad matches for us, no matter how many follow-up papers with improvements we tried to implement. In the end we switched over to a dijkstra based approach that tries to minimize the cost of the mapping, which is more computationally expensive but gives much better results. Difftastic uses a similar approach as well.[1]: https://semanticdiff.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tool has an excellent architecture section [0] that goes into how it works under the hood.  It stands out to me that a complex tool has an overview to this depth that allows you to grasp conceptually how it works.0 - https://mergiraf.org/architecture.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going through the sorts of conflicts it solves, and limitations in that, I find it claiming that in some insertions, order doesn’t matter &lt;https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html#neighbouring-insertions-...&gt;.I really don’t like that. At the language level, order may not matter, but quite frequently in such cases the order does matter, insofar as almost every human would put the two things in a particular order; or where there is a particular convention active. If you automatically merge the two sides in a different order from that, doing it automatically has become harmful.My clearest example: take Base `struct Foo; struct Bar;`, then between these two items, Left inserts `impl Foo { }`, Right inserts `struct Baz;`. To the computer, the difference doesn’t matter, but merging it as `struct Foo; struct Baz; impl Foo { } struct Bar;` is obviously bad to a human. This is the problem: it’s handling language syntax semantics, but can’t be aware of logical semantics. (Hope you can grasp what I’m trying to convey, not sure of the best words.) Left was not inserting something between Foo and Bar, it was attaching something to the end of Foo. Whereas Right was probably inserting something between Foo and Bar—but maybe even it was inserting something before Bar. You perceive that these are all different things, logically.Another example where this will quickly go wrong: in CSS rulesets, some will sort the declarations by property name lexicographically, some by property name length (seriously, it’s frequently so pretty), some will group by different types of property… you can’t know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093756</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "html-to-markdown" provides a tool for converting HTML documents into Markdown format. It is designed to simplify the process of extracting content from HTML while preserving the structure and readability. The project includes detailed documentation, installation instructions, and examples demonstrating its usage. It employs a customizable approach, allowing users to tailor the conversion process to meet their specific needs. The repository also encourages contributions from the community to improve functionality and support additional use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need this sort of thing in any other language, there's a free, no-auth, no-api-key-required, no-strings-attached API that can do this at https://jina.ai/reader/You just fetch a URL like `https://r.jina.ai/https://www.asimov.press/p/mitochondria`, and get a markdown document for the "inner" URL.I've actually used this and it's not perfect, there are websites (mostly those behind Cloudflare and other such proxies) that it can't handle, but it does 90% of the job, and is an one-liner in most languages with a decent HTTP requests library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pandochttp://www.cantoni.org/2019/01/27/converting-html-markdown-u...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! And glad to see it's MIT licensed.I wonder if it is feasible to use this as a replacement for p2k, instapaper etc for the purpose of reading on Kindle. One annoyance with these services is that the rendering is way off -- h elements not showing up as headers, elements missing randomly, source code incorrectly rendered in 10 different ways. Some are better than others, but generally they are disappointing. (Yet they expect you to pay a subscription fee.) If this is an actively maintained project that welcomes contribution, I could test it out with various articles and report/fix issues. Although I wonder how much work there will be for handling edge cases of all the websites out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093511</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;Obtainium is a platform designed to help users easily acquire and manage NFTs and cryptocurrencies. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of minting, buying, and trading digital assets while providing tools for tracking and managing portfolios. The site emphasizes security and provides resources for both beginners and experienced users to navigate the rapidly evolving world of digital collectibles and blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this app, makes it really easy to keep non-store apps up to date by linking directly to the apps GitHub repo for example.Obviously you have to be careful what you install, just as with any app not found in Play Store, but if you're getting your apps elsewhere anyway this is really convenient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use this and it's great. Only problem is when: 1) you want something outside of github (from my experience, already gitlab and codeberg can be buggy here, although very rarely), and 2) when you need a specific release channel (example: Firefox Beta, which requires a bit of work). But overall it works great. Now, one has to consider the security aspects: stores like Google Play (and, to a lesser extent, F-Droid) do perform some antimalware checks. It's not bulletproof, but it gives a bit more trust in case the dev goes rogue or is compromised. BUT you have to trust the store. With Obtainium, you have to trust: 1) the app's developer 2) Github/Gitlab/Codeberg 3) Obtainium's developer. So, it depends what's your threat model. I'm looking forward to seeing wider adoption for Accrescent!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's weird how many orgs keep their apps unavailable, as lots of users decline to submit to Play store preconditions (link phone to a Google account).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026251</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The website introduces Open Encoder, a project focused on enhancing large language models (LLMs) through efficient encoding techniques. It emphasizes the goals of improving performance and scalability in natural language processing tasks, offers insights into the methodologies used for optimization, and provides resources including documentation, research papers, and tools for developers interested in implementing advanced encoding strategies in their own LLM applications. Additionally, it invites collaboration and contributions from the research community to further refine these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research.Regardless of the specific performance of this model versus another model, I think it’s good to keep in mind that everyone benefits from this kind of work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was just messing around with LLMs all day, so had a few test cases open. Asked it to change a few things in a ~6KB C# snippet in a somewhat ambiguous, but reasonable way.GPT-4 did this job perfectly. Qwen:72b did half of the job, completely missed the other one, and renamed 1 variable that had nothing to do with the question. Llama3.1:70b behaved very similar to Qwen, which is interesting.OpenCoder:8b started reasonably well, then randomly replaced "Split('\n')" with "Split(n)" in unrelated code, and then went completely berserk, hallucinating non-existent StackOverflow pages and answers.For posterity, I saved it here: https://pastebin.com/VRXYFpzrMy best guess is that you shouldn't train it on mostly code. Natural language conversations used to train other models let them "figure out" human-like reasoning. If your training set is mostly code, it can produce output that looks like code, but it will have little value to humans.Edit: to be fair, llama3.2:3b also botched the code. But it did not hallucinate complete nonsense at least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering why Figure 1 showed a HumanEval score of 61.6 for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, but Table 1 shows a score of 88.4, i. e. better than this new model with a score of 66.5.The reason is that those are actually two different models (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base with 61.6, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct with 88.4).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095580</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses SVDQuant, a software tool developed by researchers at MIT for analyzing high-dimensional data using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It highlights the tool's ability to quantify and visualize features in a dataset, making it easier to interpret complex data structures. The post emphasizes SVDQuant's user-friendly interface and its applications in various fields, including biology and material science, showcasing how it enhances the understanding of large datasets through effective dimensionality reduction and data representation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one in a long line of posts saying "we took a model and made it smaller" and now it can run with different requirements.It is important to keep in mind that modifying a model changes the performance of the resulting model, where performance is "correctness" or "quality" of output.Just because the base model is very performant does not mean the smaller model is.This means that another model that is the same size as the new quantized model may outperform the quantized model.Suppose there are equal sized big models A and B with their smaller quantized variants a and b. A being a more performant model than B does not guarantee a being more performant than b.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demo on actual 4090 with flux schnell for next few hours: https://5jkdpo3rnipsem-3000.proxy.runpod.net/Its basically H100 speeds with 4090, 4.80it/s. 1.1 sec for flux schenll(4 steps) and 5.5 seconds for flux dev(25 steps). Compared to normal speeds(comfyui fp8 with "--fast" optimization") which is 3 seconds for schnell and 11.5 seconds for dev&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm convinced the path to ubiquity (such as embedded in smartphones) is quantization.I had to int4 a llama model to get it to properly run on my 3060.I'm curious, how much resolution / significant digits do we actually need for most genAI work? If you can draw a circle with 3.14, maybe it's good enough for fast and ubiquitous usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093112</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;In the article "Why I Quit Google," the author, Matt Lynch, shares his personal experience and reasons for leaving his job at Google. He discusses how, despite the benefits of working at a prestigious tech company, he felt increasingly disillusioned by the corporate culture, bureaucracy, and lack of meaningful impact on important projects. Lynch emphasizes the importance of passion in work and the desire for personal fulfillment, leading him to pursue new opportunities aligned with his values and interests. Overall, the piece serves as a reflection on career satisfaction and the search for a more purpose-driven path.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the same author has also published an interesting series of "annual review" blog posts summarising his progress trying to get different software businesses off the ground -- including being quite open about the finances. If you're interested in boostrapping a software business, and haven't seen them, they're well worth reading:https://mtlynch.io/tags/annual-review/https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think you learned the most important lesson of any career: the customer is not your customer. The person/people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers.Think about it like this. A customer is the entity that exchanges money for something they value; like a good or service. That's usually your manager. Or in the case of OP the promotion committee. (Many times it's both your manager and the promotion committee). They are the ones who directly control your money (raise, bonus, promotion, etc).With that perspective in mind it makes sense to manage your career as a business where you're doing things to increase the rate at which you deliver value to the entity which can trade money for that value.Many of the setbacks you faced are very common when trying to run your own business. The customer changes their mind, the market shifts the goal posts, you realize you're focusing on the wrong things. Like a business you have to constantly change your strategy and adapt to the customer; not the other way around. Why? Because the customer can very easily get their goods or services from someone else if you can't deliver what they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I agree with this. The breaking projects before completion is very annoying, but also the author seems like they were only there for a promotion? I mean a promotion is nice, but it was never really explained why that was such a dealbreaker. If the only thing keeping you at your job is the prospect of a better title, that's probably a bad sign. They then made a lifetime's worth of money at Google in four years, and then used that financial stability to do something high risk which most people can't afford to do. Regardless, I'm glad they've found work that resonates with them! Hopefully they can use that financial stability to build something useful and impactful :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Jaws is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of building and deploying applications using the JAWS (JavaScript API Wrapper &amp; Scheduler) framework. It simplifies tasks such as managing dependencies, running applications, and deployment configurations, thereby enhancing productivity for developers. The repository includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and examples, making it accessible for both new and experienced users of the JAWS framework. Additionally, it emphasizes community contributions, encouraging collaboration and improvements to the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

All the JS -&gt; WASM compilers so far have basically just been shipping a whole JS engine - this is the first one I've seen that actually tries to map JS constructs directly to WASM primitives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day I did an almost-Typescript (though much closer than assembly script) to embedded ARM compiler.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential for HPV vaccination to eliminate cervical cancer globally. It highlights the significant role that human papillomavirus (HPV) plays in cervical cancer development, emphasizing how vaccination can dramatically reduce incidence rates. The piece provides data on vaccination coverage worldwide, the disparities in access between countries, and the need for increased efforts to promote vaccination programs. It also outlines the benefits of early detection and treatment, advocating for a comprehensive approach that combines vaccination with screening to achieve the goal of eradicating cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s funny how in the US the vaccine schedule says not to get the HPV vaccine if you’re over 45. That means that insurance won’t cover it and I even struggle finding a doctor who will administer it because it goes against the guidelines.The rationale is that if you’re 45, you probably already have HPV. But that assumes that you’ve been sexually active all that time. It doesn’t take into account people who were monogamous until their 50s and then started having sex with new partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish we had therapeutic vaccines against HPV. As a man, I always got told "it's not for men", followed by "it is also for men, but only if you never had sex", followed by "it's also for men who had sex, but only to a limited age".As a male who meets all the criteria to be in a high risk group for HPV throat cancer, and who is dealing with a persistent HPV infection (as proved by warts that won't go away), I'm really sad that I may one day at a young age get cancer in my throat, and there is nothing I can do about it to prevent it. I wish we would put the same amount of energy into inventing vaccines that suppress the virus, or help the body to get rid of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The HPV vaccine has been a universal win for this generation.  Screening (pap smear) is also highly effective, but requires constant effort.The remaining gaps in screening and vaccine uptake reflect broader lack of health-care capabilities that won't be solved with pushing the HPV vaccine alone.  Changing from injectable to oral could help, but isn't on the table, and local populations and governments are likely to become increasingly resistant to outsiders waving their science authorities, particularly on family matters.Both authors are Phd's working in outreach - i.e., they seem to have no experience with deploying HPV campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045373</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the court's decision in Heckman v. Live Nation, where Ticketmaster's attempt to enforce arbitration clauses in its ticket purchase agreements was largely unsuccessful. The court ruled that the arbitration terms were unconscionable and unenforceable, highlighting concerns about unfairness and lack of transparency in the arbitration process. The decision sets a precedent for consumer rights, indicating that companies cannot impose one-sided arbitration clauses that could disadvantage consumers. The author emphasizes the importance of this ruling in challenging overreaching contractual practices in the ticketing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I won't agree to arbitration services at all, if it removes your right to sue.  I have been burned in the past by a manifestly unfair arbitration decision.  We submitted our evidence, they asked the other side for their response.  The other side lied, and provided no evidence.  The arbitration service simply decided in the other parties favor; we were allowed no rebuttal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitration seems like how courts-martials were in the early days... completely lopsided in favor of the State, except it's corporations now.  Either we get rid of arbitration (which I don't think is gonna happen) or there needs to be regulations to bring it under control (whatever that may be, i have no idea myself).Almost every service I use has, over time, switched me over to require the use of arbitration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US arbitration law is weird. A particularly bizarre one is that a judge did not find it possible to strike down an arbitration agreement where there arbitrator is part of the organisation being complained of:https://archive.is/mIfMs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42047027</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new technique called Early Cascade Injection, which enhances the stealthiness of code injection during the Windows process creation phase. It details how this method allows attackers to infiltrate processes more discreetly by leveraging the early stages of process initialization, thereby avoiding detection by conventional security measures. The piece emphasizes the implications for cybersecurity, urging defenders to adapt their strategies in light of this advanced injection technique.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great! We have been working on Windows Process (and COM) injection since 2003 [1][2][3]. I need to talk with the current development team about reviewing it with the EDR-Preloading technique. We have a driver also that suspends a new process before hooking it, we also hook existing processes.Business-wise our work on this went down once Microsoft Detours was made FOSS even when our products has other capabilities. A good old thread is here [4].[1] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2[2] https://github.com/nektra/Deviare-InProc[3] https://github.com/nektra/RemoteBridge[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/22crn0/gpl_alt...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all overriding and detouring is malicious.  For instance, Steam detours Direct3D every time you launch a game in order to set up the steam overlay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised the call to WriteProcessMemory or creating suspended processes isn't being picked up, it usually gets you a lot of points on the "Detect binary as malware heuristic" detector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095752</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Zig, a programming language that offers a unique syntax and structure compared to traditional languages. It highlights the language's features, such as its focus on performance and safety, and provides examples of how its syntax encourages clear and concise code. The author explains various elements of the Zig programming language, including its approach to error handling, memory management, and compile-time execution, aiming to illustrate why Zig may be an appealing choice for developers seeking a more efficient and readable coding experience. Overall, the piece serves as an introduction to Zig's unconventional syntax and its benefits in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even more unfriendly-yet-typical line is where you create an allocator, and few lines further you run allocator() method on it, to get ...an allocator (but you had it already! Or maybe you didn't ?) Same: you create Writer, but then you run a writer() method on it.Here is the code to illustrate:    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();
    var visited = std.BufSet.init(arena.allocator());

    var bw = std.io.bufferedWriter(std.io.getStdOut().writer());
    const stdout = bw.writer();

So.. what are the entities we use, conceptually? "allocatorButNotReally" and "thisTimeReallyAnAllocatorIPromise"? Same for the writer?Plus, the documentation isn't much explaining wtf is this and why.The answer is probably buried somewhere in forums history, blogs and IRC logs, because there must have been consensus established why is it ok to write code like that. But, the lack of clear explanation is not helping with casual contact with the language. It's rather all-or-nothing - either you spend a lot of time daily in tracking all the media about the ecosystem, or you just don't get the basics. Not good IMO. (and yes I like a lot about the language).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As people have pointed already elsewhere, the same declaration can be made more clear by isolating the type like so:    var gpa: std.mem.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}) = .{};&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you've been writing zig for a while, seeing `.{}` in an argument list intuitively means "default arguments".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42050954</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1960s, Ford has been storing vintage cars in an underground cave in Kansas City to protect them from the elements and preserve their condition. This unique storage facility, known as the "Ford Motor Company Underground," houses over 600 vehicles, including classic models and prototypes. The initiative not only serves to safeguard automotive history but also supports future restoration and preservation efforts, showcasing the brand's commitment to its heritage. The site highlights the fascinating connection between Ford and its collection, emphasizing the significance of these vehicles in the context of the company's legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re government cheese..."The story of “government cheese” started with Jimmy Carter’s campaign promise to support the price of milk (specifically, to support a $0.06/gallon price increase). Consider it a rare campaign promise that happened to be kept, though it wasn’t completely thought through."Enforcing a higher price for something commonly either means restricting supply or increasing demand. In this case, supporting the price increase meant that the government had to buy milk en masse. What happens when you buy lots of milk? You discover that it does not keep well. That in turn led to the milk being converted into other forms that last longer: cheese, primarily. The other benefit of cheese being its greater density — producing one pound of cheese requires roughly 10 pounds of milk."But then what to do with the cheese? At first, the government just stored the cheese, where it apparently filled most of the large-scale cold storage in the US. (Rough cost for one year of the milk price support program (1981): $2 billion paid to dairy farmers in price support and $120 million in storage.)"
https://unintendedconsequenc.es/food-from-thought/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a similar facility called Iron Mountain in Boyers, PA that stores, among other things, millions of government records:https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/01/inside-iron-mountain.h...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a ton of facilities like this for storage of various stuff in middle America.  The limestone geology (there was once a sea between the Appalachian and Rockies) lend itself well to them.  These facilities store all manner of things, almost everyone reading this has probably eaten cheese from one of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42078469</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Grim Fandango," a landmark video game released in 1998, known for its unique blend of film noir and Mexican culture as it follows the story of Manny Calavera, a travel agent in the Land of the Dead. It highlights the game's innovative use of 3D graphics and intricate storytelling, as well as its influence on the adventure game genre. The author reflects on the game's themes of life, death, and redemption, along with its memorable characters and puzzles, and considers its legacy in the gaming industry. The piece encapsulates why Grim Fandango continues to resonate with fans and maintains a significant place in video game history.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well I certainly cannot relate to the criticism. I played the game early on as a teen (and every few years since) and while, at times difficult, I never thought the puzzles were "confusing", it seemed like a pretty organic combination of styles of puzzles built into the game. The head turning dynamics I have also found to be quiet pleasant as it made me relate to the character more.Not that criticism is bad but Grim Fandango seems to one of the most if not most loved adventure games (just visit and adventure game forum or subreddit). So one can take it apart and think about the individual parts but the whole is certainly a masterpiece of a game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think one understated problem Grim Fandango had is that it's too adult.Today "adult" often means "there's sex and/or gore", but the content is still simple and juvenile. But Grim Fandango isn't like that, it's just full of themes that probably confused the heck out of almost every kid that tried to play it.Like the very first chapter throws you right into office politics. You deal with stealing a job from another salesman, sabotage a pneumatic tube messaging system, and sneak into your boss' office.It all makes perfect sense for adults familiar with office work and all the movies it references. But I recall I tried it when I was maybe 14 and I couldn't make head nor tails of it. I didn't even realize the pneumatic tubes were actually a thing.Things like Monkey Island and even Full Throttle are far more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article talks about how Lua "has gone on to become a staple language of modern game development", but could have given more credit to Grim Fandango for that. It was the first game to use Lua and and its success was what put the language on the map when it comes to gamedev.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097261</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of pursuing larger, more significant opportunities or goals in life, comparing it to the metaphor of "bigger fish." It emphasizes the importance of stepping out of comfort zones and exploring new challenges that can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. The author shares insights on the mindset required to embrace these challenges and the potential rewards that come from taking risks and aiming higher.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good article, neat research behind it.I think the paper's contributions really don't have anything to do with ML; it's about the new side channel with interrupts, which is a cool find. ML just gets more people to read it, which I guess is ok. I mean, you could just use "statistics" here in much the same way.I remember an advisor once telling me: once you figure out what a paper is really about, rewrite it, and remove the stuff you used to think it was about. The title of this paper should be about the new side channel, not about the ML story, imho.But this is just a nitpick. Great work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonderful article. I never thought I'll be able to understand side-channel attacks so easily.The article read like a murder mystery where you know who the villain is right in the beginning but you need to find it how they did it!Marked as favorite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is awesome, your writing is super approachable and the interactive demos are really cool.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the growing trend of climate migration, where individuals and communities are forced to relocate due to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and dwindling resources. It highlights various case studies from around the world, illustrating how entire populations are being displaced and the associated challenges they face, including legal recognition and humanitarian aid. The article emphasizes the need for global action and policies to address the root causes of climate change and support affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was remarkably little in the way of security for early satellites (or space probes).I recently encountered here on HN the suggestion that, the main reason you can't find particularly in-depth details on the Voyager space probes, is project security.  Security through obscurity, mostly.  If amateurs can detect the signal from the Voyager probes with a small dish antenna, it's at least conceivable someone might hook up a really powerful transmitter, aim it in the probe's direction, and start issuing commands.  There's no cryptography, of course.  The resources required to hijack like that in the 1970s would have been much greater, and I doubt being hacked was much on the designer's minds.The Apollo Program was the same; today anyone with the documentation, a small dish antenna, a software radio, and some nerd dedication, would be able to hack Apollo midflight via its radio link.  It was the equivalent of a root prompt with no password on an exposed port.A bit closer to home, there's a tremendous amount of semi-functional orbital junk with a similar lack of security, decades-old computers still waiting for telecommands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This didn't happen recently. From the article:&gt;Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- "We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about."There was one of these just a couple weeks ago (and that was not the first),https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41904346 ("Intelsat 33e breaks up in geostationary orbit")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093851</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;OuteTTS is a text-to-speech model developed by OuteAI, designed to generate human-like speech from written text. It is based on a robust architecture with 350 million parameters, enabling it to produce high-quality audio outputs. The model is suitable for various applications, including voiceovers for videos, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. The page provides details on how to use the model, its capabilities, and links to access it on the Hugging Face platform, along with sample outputs to demonstrate its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW I was really impressed by the results of F5-TTS. The thing I liked best was the "Tagged" TTS, where you can specify a tag to use different tones of your own voice, like  {Angry}What have you done?
  {Suprised}Me, I did nothing?
  {Shouting}Who else do you think I'm talking to?
  {Sad}Why are you always shouting at me?

I wonder if this would also work for "Character" tags, like  {Susan}How was your day?
  {Peter}I had a great day.

That would open great new ways of having audio books read by cloned voices - switching between characters with the same voice like often done by the real narrators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a quick try results aren't good. Sounds bland, and the text I type isn't exactly equal to the text that is spoken. Didn't try with voice cloning though.Why is good TTS so expensive and why are there no good open source options? Is it just from the need for high quality training data? I don't imagine these models are more expensive to run compared to SOTA LLMs, yet they cost so much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve had great luck so far with GPT-SoVITS. With a custom trained Japanese model and clean reference audio the quality is outstanding. It is quite finicky to set up and use though.https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043967</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice. I've had occasion to import/export, edit, etc. thousands of CSV files from multiple software platforms over the years and this tool looks like a simple way for a user to determine whether there are issues in the CSV file that will cause problems on import to their application.One question I immediately have is how this compares to a spreadsheet CSV import tool such as the one in Excel which is extremely flexible. It appears that this app requires a specific format (comma delimited, new line at end of each row) in order to work. I never tried to count the times that a CSV file that I had to work with required editing in order to facilitate import to Excel or other application because CSV is such a non-standard standard output that the only way one could know whether the import would be successful was to pop it into an editor, like Notepad++ and examine it before import. Notepad++ was a critical tool in the chain to force compliance for all the different applications I used. Each application allowed CSV import/export but some accepted almost any delimiter while others were strict about file format and failing to understand the expected CSV format for each would definitely cause headaches as some input errors could leave a very subtle footprint that you may not catch until late in processing.Anyway, it appears that your definition of CSV format is pretty strict so how do you propose that a user manage importation of files that do not fit your CSV definition? Notepad++ before import to verify compliance?I also see one thing on the main page under "Security" that looks like it could be worded differently.&gt;No tracking or analytics software is used for privacyTo me, this implies that no steps have been taken to manage user/data privacy.Perhaps a comma could be inserted so that it reads "...used, for privacy." or maybe it should read:For (user/data) privacy, there is no tracking or analytics software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work!Do you have any plans for data cleaning?I am working on a somewhat similar open source project.  I intend to add heuristic data cleaning.  With the UI I want to be able to toggle between different strategies quickly - strip characters from a column to treat it as numeric, if less than 2% or 5% of values have a character, fill na with mean, interpret dates in different formats - drop if the date doesn't parse.  The idea bing that if it's really quick to change between different strategies, you can create more opinionated strategies to get to the right answer faster.Happy to collaborate and talk tables with anyone who's interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! Does anyone know of any javascript libraries that I could use to get this type of distribution visualisation from tabular data?

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a concise history of Cyrix, a company known for its role in the x86 processor market during the 1990s. It discusses the foundation of Cyrix in 1988, its development of innovative processors that aimed to compete with Intel and AMD, and its strategic partnerships and product releases. The piece highlights the company's challenges, including legal battles and market competition, which ultimately led to its acquisition by VIA Technologies in 1999. It reflects on Cyrix's legacy and contributions to computing, especially in enhancing performance and affordability during the era.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I owe my entire career to the high school internship I had in the IT department at Cyrix in Richardson, circa 1996. It was awesome. Learned everything about building PCs for employees and Windows networking. So much free hardware walked out the door -- usually stuff that was slightly out of date, just stacks of it everywhere.  Spent the next three summers there through college too. It was really exciting there at that time, Internet age just taking off. They had beer at 4PM on Fridays out back.Everything went downhill with the series of acquisitions. Anyway, I'm grateful for my time there... I can trace where I am now directly back to the guy who first gave me a chance there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s very interesting to learn about Cyrix and how innovative they happened to be. Back in the 90s most of us, at least in Europe, learned about Cyrix from either friends or shop clerks. And back then Cyrix had a terrible reputation, they were considered almost as illegal Intel CPU clones. AMD also had a terrible reputation until they released their Socket 7 AMD K6 CPUs and later on their Super Socket 7 K6-2, K6-3 CPU’s just before their amazing Athlon and Duron family. Cyrix never regained any reputation, and slowly their offerings ended up mixed with VIA or Centaur CPUs. Celeron and AMD CPU’s were already cheap enough so no one was buying Cyrix anymore to just save $20-$30 on a $1000 computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a Cyrix 486 somewhere around 1992. Working with Windows NT and Visual C++ turned up subtle problems that could be worked around with some compiler switches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42035990</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Write a Book" on Parenthetically Speaking provides a comprehensive guide for aspiring authors, outlining the key steps to successfully write and publish a book. It emphasizes the importance of defining one's purpose, creating a writing schedule, and developing a clear outline. Additionally, the article offers tips on drafting, revising, and seeking feedback, as well as advice on navigating the publishing process, whether through traditional publishing or self-publishing. The overall aim is to empower writers by demystifying the writing process and encouraging them to share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree. I DID write a book! https://howtoopensource.dev/My biggest tip is this: Don’t skip getting beta readers. High quality feedback is really hard to come by. I changed my tool chain to add a google form at the end of each chapter and got strong buy in from a handful of people with the finished first draft in a beta state. In the end some bailed but one left amazing feedback resulting in massive structural changes.The process of writing a book is two things (to me). The most obvious is sharing information. The second, often overlooked, but biggest benefit IMHO is how you will grow and learn the source material even better than you already do. Even if you don’t ever publish it, it’s still worthwhile to putting in the effort to write a book. GLHF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a university lecturer, I have interviewed many people… academics and admins. I have taught in many S E Asian universities and multi-lingualism is the norm, with English assumed to be the ‘Lingua franca’. Almost everyone I interview claims to have ‘excellent’ skills in written and spoken English. Almost none of them could produce so much as a single paragraph of English that did not burn my eyes.Prior to starting writing my first book, I had already accumulated some experience in academic writing. I thought it would be a doddle. I can honestly say that it was one of the most demanding experiences of my life.The worst thing is the degree to which I was blind to my own shortcomings… just like all those people I interviewed.Moral of the story… "writing is easy; you just stare at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead"  (Gene Fowler).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The challenge is not writing a book, but letting it go.I wrote Understanding SEO https://fullstackoptimizatio.gumroad.com/l/understanding-seo...4 times. Each time it took me a year. The last time together with an editor. And I could have gone on, over every word, every sentence again. In the end my editor forces me.  In the end you just have to publish it, otherwise it does not exist.Still think I did good, even after more than 7 years I still sell a few paper and some more e copies per month just by WOM, so yeah, must be some value in there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42096915</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recent breakthrough in cancer research, highlighting a study that reveals a novel method for targeting specific cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. It emphasizes the potential of this approach to increase treatment efficacy and reduce side effects commonly associated with traditional therapies. The authors express optimism about the implications for future cancer treatments and stress the importance of ongoing research to validate these findings and explore their applicability across different types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;T1 here.

I am happy that the researchers are putting it out there to attract interest and investment, but the GRI-type insulins remained in lab settings for about 30 years now and it is somewhat troubling to not see progression into and through the stages of pharma clinical trials on T1D patients.Clearly, there is tremendous potential to make money here – diabetes is a very serious epidemic worldwide. So why hasn't this progressed out of the lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMHO: This is the closest thing to a "cure" coming out in the next decade. Like a couple injections a day, wearing a CGM to make sure it is working, no calculations, no worry about carb intake.A lot of the other "cures"  involve immunosuppressants which have a ton of bad side effects that can be worse than diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008891</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of social media on mental health, highlighting both the potential benefits and risks. It emphasizes how social platforms can foster community and support for individuals facing mental health challenges, while also warning about issues such as cyberbullying, anxiety, and the pressure to curate a perfect online presence. The piece calls for a more nuanced understanding of social media's role in mental wellbeing, suggesting that responsible usage and awareness of its effects are crucial for healthier online interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cases like Tom Perez should never happen. He was held for the murder of his father who was alive.

And your agedmother will have to pay the fines, making her homeless."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never talk to the police. Do not "just give a statement" to get them to let you go.Identify yourself when asked, ask for a lawyer, then shut up.If communicating something to the police might be helpful for you, do that through your lawyer."You can beat the charges but you can't beat the ride"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091423</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Saturn V rocket's unique fueldraulic gimbal system, which was a critical technology that allowed for precise control over the rocket's engine orientation. It explains how the system uses hydraulic fluid combined with fuel to generate the necessary movement and stability during flight. The piece highlights the advantages of the fueldraulic system over traditional mechanical gimbal mechanisms, detailing its impact on the success of Apollo missions and providing insights into its engineering principles and applications in aerospace technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short but interesting answer about why "fueldraulic" systems are still used, including on the Boeing 777, and F35: https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/24787/why-is-fu...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the Saturn V was retired, they put one out in the front yard of the Johnson Space Center.It was kind of sizable, and for years you could see it when you drove by on NASA Road 1.Laying sideways where the different stages were laid end-to-end, and walk right up and touch it, with outdoor photo ops all over the place.Eventually they built buildings to enclose it, which you now have to go inside if you want to take a look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love those mid-century names: FuelDraulic, Hydra-Glide, PowerGlide, Ultramatic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045830</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Body Keeps the Score is a brilliant but difficult read. Do recommend it.https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study is specifically about "learning" that takes place without interacting with the brain.It's learning in the same sense the immune system learns to fight of infections. The difference is that the mechanism by which cells record state is similar to one of the mechanisms also used by the brain at the cellular level, which you would expect.The cells and structures that make up the brain evolved from simpler structures, so we would expect some reuse of mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings up the question about whether there are hereditary information transmission methods other than DNA. There are so many things we ascribe to “instinct” that might be information transmitted from parent to offspring in some encoded format.Like songs that newborn songbirds know, migration routes that animals know without being shown, that a mother dog should break the amniotic sac to release the puppies inside, what body shapes should be considered  more desirable for a mate out of an infinite variety of shapes.It seems it implausible to me that all of these things can be encoded as chemical signalling; it seems to require much more complex encoding of information, pattern matching, templates, and/or memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094427</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on optimizing database performance in Ruby on Rails applications using ActiveRecord. It highlights common performance bottlenecks and provides practical strategies for improvement, such as eager loading associations, optimizing database queries, using appropriate indexing, and caching strategies. The author emphasizes the importance of monitoring and profiling to identify specific areas for optimization, and offers several tools and techniques to enhance database efficiency and overall application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you start hitting performance issues with Rails, switch to using Arel for queries and pump the data into lightweight classes. ActiveRecord optimization magic is a foot bazooka.If you want to reuse the code between these objects and the corresponding ActiveRecord model, do it with a module.The biggest problem with Rails is that people get so glued to the conventions that everything gets shoehorned into a model or controller instead of using a better abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another approach are materialized views, where you basically create a caching table with exactly the fields you need. Can be used for any query, but particularly valuable for rich reporting where you may be pulling data from all over your associations. It requires you to write the source query in raw SQL, but with the Scenic gem, pulls it into the Active Record ecosystem with models, migrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post covering many of the main ways to improve efficiency.Here’s a related post I wrote for AppSignal:What's Coming in Ruby on Rails 7.2: Database Features in Active Record https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/07/24/whats-coming-in-ruby-o...For folks interested in additional depth on optimizing Postgres for use with Active Record/Rails, please check out my book:High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails https://andyatkinson.com/pgrailsbookThanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42059650</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth mentioning that, in Star Trek’s universe, tables were routinely covered in PADDs - not because it’s excessive, but that even with eink the most usable environment was multiple virtual sheets of paper at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a heavy ReMarkable user, mostly as a note taking device when doing client meetings.For personal use I use it a lot for annotating philosophy papers and source materials, and the lack of a split screen feature is extremely frustrating.Writing annotations or commentaries on texts means writing in the margins or switching back and forth between books (often a paper book and the remarkable for writing, or 2 notebooks in the device which is a slow operation).A split screen mode would have been extremely useful, or lacking that a method for having a page-matched 'fold-out' so I can just associate a full blank page to each source page for my commentary.I know there's an unofficial hack that adds this, but why ReMarkable doesn't I can't fathom, especially as annotations and such are marketed as primary use cases for the device./rant :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After a few days of using Daylight Computer, I have to admit that it solves all the pain points I had with Remarkable 2:- 60 FPS screen makes a huge difference in reading experience, especially if you want to flip through a PDF quickly- It's an Android tablet, meaning that I can use my usual programs and don't have an awkward "how do I bring it to Remarkable and back" processThe downsides:- It's $729 vs $379 for the Remarkable 2- It's heavierHowever, I'm not going back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42056654</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses iterative alpha deblending, a technique used in computer graphics to improve the quality of images that have been blended with transparency. It explains the challenges of traditional alpha blending, particularly in preserving detail and achieving realistic results. The author presents a method for refining the blending process through iterative calculations, which helps in eliminating artifacts and enhances the visual fidelity of the final image. Additionally, practical implementation details and examples are provided to guide readers in applying this technique in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a letter discussing the philosophical ideas of Nikolai Fyodorov, emphasizing his vision of a future where humanity overcomes death and achieves resurrection through technological and spiritual means. The author reflects on Fyodorov's influence on contemporary thought, highlighting themes of human responsibility towards the deceased, the potential for collective progress, and the ethical implications of scientific advancements. The letter encourages readers to consider how Fyodorov's ideas can guide modern society in addressing existential challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fyodorov's philosophy is a key driver of the plot of the trilogy of novels by Hannu Rajaniemi, starting with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has some similarity to Tipler's "omega point" hypothesis iin his 1994 book "The Physics of Immortality" [1]. I read this years ago but have recently bought it again to have another look at. It seems to be a PDF on the Internet Archive as well. It was a very wild idea.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Tipler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those in LA, there’s a related exhibit at the Museum of Jurassic Technology.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of ham radio operators during the New York Marathon to enhance communication and safety for the event. It highlights how these volunteers provide crucial support by relaying information about the race, assisting with medical emergencies, and ensuring that organizers can communicate effectively across the vast event. The piece underscores the importance of amateur radio in emergency situations and public events, showcasing the skills and dedication of the ham radio community.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where's Nextel PTT when you need it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to see coverage of ham radio volunteers here! The Boston Marathon has a similar volunteer-led program which I've participated in since college [1]. It's such a fun event and a great way to combine technical interests with community service. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to join a community of like-minded technical folks. The group isn't what the "old men with radios" stereotype would suggest either.[1] https://www.arrl.org/news/amateur-radio-provides-communicati...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick plug for anyone who may be interested in ham but a little intimidated by the license that’s required. Contact your local ham club or group (I guarantee you there is one). Ours had a fast track to getting people licensed. It amounted to a one day cram course immediately before the technician’s exam (the oddly named entry level license) with a 90+% pass rate. The philosophy is to get people licensed and on board and interested and THEN start learning. It’s kind of a counter intuitive strategy but it certainly got me involved where I wouldn’t have been otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037750</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NASA's lack of communication regarding an incident involving a SpaceX Crew Dragon splashdown that resulted in crew members being sent to the hospital. Despite the significance of the event, NASA has not publicly addressed the situation or provided details about what occurred during the re-entry and landing process. The lack of transparency raises concerns among space enthusiasts and experts about safety protocols and the handling of emergencies in space missions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the kind of headline that would appear 20 minutes into a B-rate sci-fi movie.As we approach Act II, an intrepid young journalist rushes to the hospital to find out what’s really going on… But wait, who is in the black car trailing her?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people seem to deal with long-term zero-G better than others. The cosmonaut who spent the longest continuous time in space was Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 days in zero G in the early 1990s, came back fine, had a good career after returning, and recently died at age 80.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could it be an initially-unnoticed chemical leak in the Crew Dragon? That could explain how it hospitalized four astronauts at once, and also why they're uncharacteristically afraid of media coverage. They were evasive in a similar way when Starliner was first having issues—they're scared of the politics, or of the lawyers.edit to add: These spacecraft all use very toxic fuels, and this one has had issues with fuel leaks before [0]. I'm not sure how or if those could affect the crew. Maybe if there was contamination on an exterior surface, they could have been exposed on landing? IIRC it is or used to be standard procedure to take air samples before opening crewed spacecraft, for this reason.edited again to add: I found it! It Apollo-Soyuz in 1975—the entire Apollo crew were poisoned by fuel when they opened the spacecraft, and were hospitalized with chemical pneumonitis [1,2].[0] https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-delays-cargo-dr... ("NASA and SpaceX stand down on Dragon launch to study hydrazine issue")[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo–Soyuz#Re-entry_and_afte...[2] https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19770023791 ("The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Medical report")- (wiki) "The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by unignited reaction control system (RCS) hypergolic propellants venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in Honolulu, Hawaii.[22] Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believed he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and begun drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.[23]"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42092385</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the long-term effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) since its enactment in 1990, highlighting both its successes and shortcomings. It examines how the ADA has contributed to increased accessibility and rights for individuals with disabilities, while also critiquing areas where implementation has fallen short. The article presents a nuanced perspective on the ADA's impact on various aspects of society, including employment, education, and public spaces, ultimately advocating for continued efforts to improve and enforce disability rights.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested in trying Ada out, I wrote a a Rustup-like app that installs Ada's package manager (Alire) on macOS and Linux: https://www.getada.devIt was also featured on HN (194 points | 6 months ago | 117 comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40132373I've gone from not having anything Ada related on my computer to installing the toolchain, initiating a project , writing, compiling, and running "Hello World" in less then 2 minutes.Ada has had something of a resurgence in the last couple years, with the latest standard (2022) officially released and for the first time in a few years, Ada has its own dev room at FOSDEM! https://fosdem.org/2025/news/2024-10-28-devrooms-announced/There's also a growing community at ada-lang.io with a thriving forum: https://forum.ada-lang.io/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It being a one-pass compiler bugs me (there is no excuse for a modern language to require forward declarations).He refers to the need for forward declarations as "one-pass compiler".  Historically at least, Ada compilers were infamous for requiring many passes and being consequently slow.Whether it is still acceptable for a programming language to require forward declaration seems to me rather a matter of personal taste.  Sure, compilers improved and there's plenty of memory for them to use, but human programmers' capacity increased little, if any, I'd think.  I think of those forward declarations as form of double-entry bookkeeping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once did an engineering camp at the Air Force academy and in one of the classes we programmed Lego mindstorms with Ada - something like https://www.adacore.com/academia/projects/real-time-mindstor...I do wish we had better options for embedded!

&lt;p&gt;The article details a vulnerability found in SQLite, which can be exploited through a bit-flipping attack. This type of attack manipulates the binary representation of data to alter its meaning or behavior when processed by the database, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access or corrupt data. The author explains how such vulnerabilities can arise, emphasizing the importance of security measures in database management and providing insights into the technical aspects of the SQLite architecture that enable these exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL, one of the most popular databases for reliable data management, also does not enable this feature by default."By default, data pages are not protected by checksums, but this can optionally be enabled for a cluster. "
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.htmlI feel it's quite unfair for the title to call out sqlite on checksums, when in reality, as the very closing line of the article states most databases don't do checksum verifications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sqlite is the wrong layer at which to care about storage hardware failures. That would be the job of the disks themselves, the hardware or software volume manager, or filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The checksum in the WAL is to detect incomplete writes (due to crash or power failure). That data was never committed successfully. Throwing an error for this scenario would mean that sqlite is unable to recover from a crash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094663</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article addresses common misconceptions about SQLite, clarifying its capabilities and limitations. It highlights that SQLite is not just a lightweight database for small applications but is also capable of handling complex workloads and concurrent transactions effectively. It dispels myths regarding its performance and scalability, emphasizing that SQLite is suitable for a variety of applications beyond mobile and embedded systems. The piece aims to educate readers on the true nature of SQLite and its appropriate use cases, encouraging a more informed perspective on database choices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing from this, but very important: you can connect to the same SQLite database file multiple times inside the same process (e.g. in different threads) but you can also connect to the same SQLite database file from multiple different processes on the same machine (with the same filesystem - NFS will lead to all kinds of nasty problems).Easy way to prove this to yourself: run two different terminals, run "sqlite3 data.db" in each one, run create table / insert / update queries in one and watch the results become visible to selects in the other.Changes only become visible to other connections after they have been committed.In default mode any writes will hold an exclusive lock and will cause any reads to be blocked waiting for that lock. In WAL mode reads can continue even while writes are taking place.Writes can only run one at a time, but can queue waiting for each other to finish - and since most writes take microseconds to run this is very rarely a problem.The most complicated thing to understand is the need to use BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION in concurrent environments to avoid the occasional SQLITE_BUSY exception. The best explanation I've seen of this is here: https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-rails-t... - search for SQLITE_BUSY.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just dealt with a lot of sqlite concurrency stuff recently. When I first got started, a lot of recommendations were that apps should create a connection and hold that connection its the duration. This works great but I feel like it's worth noting that this can get dangerous when you're working in a multi-threaded context.You can have one thread in the middle of stepping through the results of a SELECT prepared statement and if another thread resets the statement and runs it again, that original thread will start stepping through the results from the other thread's call.  Or if both threads begin a transaction, you'll get nested transaction errors.Things get really confusing, especially because you might not notice the problems until the app is running on a slower machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are benefits to having a single writer connection (and multiple readers).One is that you can get fairer and more efficient locking. The (interruptible) file lock APIs that SQLite uses lead to a lot of sleeping and retrying that wastes time, and is not very fair.https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/07/19/sqlite-in-ruby-ba...Another some APIs, like the backup API, work better if they can track writes, and (e.g.) backing up from the single writer connection helps there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095012</guid></item><item><title>46.

It emphasizes the importance of fostering education, promoting creativity, and developing skills that encourage higher-level thinking to address the challenges posed by this deficit.

Maybe you just don’t hear about it because it’s “boring”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software engineering and finance have completely sucked the air out of the STEM room.I'll be surprised if in a generation anyone in the US knows how to build anything other than JavaScript apps and swap agreements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post doesn't address the elephant in the room -- wages in biology seem to be supressed due to an oversupply of life sciences scientists willing to do tasks in various corporate and academic labs.Since life science wages (rewards) seem to be so low compared to other careers in relation to the density of advanced degree holders, the ambitions need to be that much bigger to make it worth it to found uncertain and risky startups. Only big ideas would be worth funding. Ecosystem tooling startups might be founded once more capital for that category trickles in.&gt;&gt;And I have no doubt that Patrick Collinson — the CEO of Stripe [...]Patrick's last name is Collison, not Collinson, as per the wikipedia link that the blog post references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095513</guid></item><item><title>47.

I can't stress how important his talk was in the overall success of htmx, and I'm glad he followed up on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My only counter is that for a real-time collaborative app the server should be the single source of truth about application state, which would make htmx a good choice for that type of application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any major websites using htmx?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42091909</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;NASA is enhancing medical support for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by establishing a hospital on the station. This initiative aims to address healthcare needs in space, enabling better management of medical emergencies and routine health monitoring. The project signifies a significant advancement in astronaut care, reflecting the increasing importance of health and safety as space missions extend in duration and complexity. The hospital will be equipped with necessary medical technology and staffed by experts to ensure astronaut well-being during missions.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether there was another illness or emergency who knows. But the shock of sudden gravity could trigger things.I think this type of headline just gets views because people want to believe they made alien contact or something ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093560</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; You'd better not dare write your desktop application in HTML. What has this world come to???Ok thats clear. But then ten sentences later:&gt; Of course, you aren't going to write your UI in C, only an idiot would do that. Instead, you want to write it in some kind of markup language.Now, let me think of some markup language that is universally known and has at least some pretence to be about laying out information on a screen... Thats right, html.The thing with UI frameworks in the 21st century of flying cars, AGI and rapidly approaching Singularity, is that its a stagnating mess.There should be a nice, standardized, cross-platform, easy to get started and progressively expandable way to build high quality visual apps. For some elusive reason, we cant have good things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trivial examples of Gtk+ apps seem to be legion but to find a decent tutorial that works its way through a moderately complex and usable app seem to be scarce.  In particular I haven't found a decent example of using the GTKBuilder class and complete documentation of the XML properties seems almost nonexistent.Aside from that, instead of writing a GNOME app in C, isn't Vala or GJS the preferred language now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice post but the images don't load for me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070807</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The content showcases a collection of high-quality images and illustrations, emphasizing digital art and photography. It highlights the creative works of the artist, focusing on aesthetic compositions and vibrant visuals. The platform serves as a portfolio, aiming to engage viewers and promote the artist's style and vision in the realm of visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Apple uses the ‘IMG_XXXX’ naming convention for all images and videos captured on iOS devices, where XXXX is a unique sequence number.For what it's worth, Apple are just conforming to the JEITA/CIPA DCF standard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_Camera_File_sy...“DCF file names” specification sez… http://www.kronometric.org/phot/std/DC-009-2010_E.pdf#page=2...“File names conforming to the following rules are called DCF file names.• The file name is 8 characters (not including the file extension).• The first four characters consist only of the upper-case alphanumeric characters shown in Table 1• These are referred to as the DCF file name Free characters. They shall not contain two-byte characters or special codes.• The four characters that follow are a number between "0001" and "9999". "0000" shall not be used. These four digits are referred to as File number.• Files with the same file number stored in the same DCF directory are considered to be object component files as defined in 4.3.2.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The website http://astronaut.io/ does a similar thing but for recent videos, and not just from iPhones. From the home page:&gt; These videos come from YouTube. They were uploaded in the last week and have titles like DSC 1234 and IMG 4321. They have almost zero previous views. They are unnamed, unedited, and unseen (by anyone but you).At one point you might be at a school recital in Malaysia, and the next minute you are at a birthday in Ecuador. It's amazing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A little bit tangent, and I'm definitely looking at it from rose colored glasses... but been playing with it for the 30 minutes, and most of the videos look so real? Like when you go on TikTok / Instagram nowadays, there are obviously unlimited amount of content. But there's this sense of everything being edited multiple times, people trying to create their own "brand", nothing looking real. It's a shame how we over-financialized everything and sucked out the fun. Or maybe I just got old.Side note, I'll also recommend people to look up "X city in 1990s / 2000s" on YouTube. San Francisco, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Toronto, London and etc. have cool slice of life content from people who were very into camcorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:01:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102506</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;IronCalc is a web-based tool designed for users to calculate the weight and specifications of various iron and steel materials used in construction and fabrication. The site allows users to input specific dimensions and receive precise calculations, including weight, volume, and surface area. It aims to simplify the design process for engineers, architects, and builders by providing quick access to essential material data and enabling efficient project planning and estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was an excel enthusiast and studied accounting mainly for Excel. Although I have moved to programming unlike most I still do think Excel is awesome.I sincerely commend the enthusiasm, but working in the industry as the "excel expert", I think most outsider does not understand the "cult" aspect of Excel.Excel works. That is it.Trying to replace excel with anything will be percieved as replacing a calculator with some alien substance that does math. Excel is like Pencil and Pen. You can not replace it.Excel is not software it is a tool.I have had my fair share backlash when trying to introduce replacement and complimentary tools. To replace excel, you not only need to  advocate for it's usefulness and you need to be also be liable to the complaints from excel users. If anything goes wrong no how minor with the new tool, you are the one who introduced all these mess.So, in practice what usually happens is that, when people hit UX challenges they go to a consulting firm and commission a backoffice software to address the Excel limitations. Some business may pay for nocode but that is very rare. They go to backoffice software firm and they build a CRUD software that is now not replacing Excel but compliments it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey! This is my project!
Amazed to see this here.
I'll try to answer questions people might have&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cool project, but I don't particularly like "The democratization of spreadsheets" as a catchphrase. Like, what does that even mean? If by "democratization" you mean like, more able to be used, well anyone can go download LibreOffice or for the web use CryptPad's Spreadsheets, and if you mean that it's more open, well both of those are open source. Is this project specifically run democratically or something? It just seems like a really bad use of meaningless marketing terminology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095292</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the city of Neft Daslari, an oil-rich region located in the Caspian Sea, highlighting its unique features and the challenges it faces due to environmental concerns and the global shift towards renewable energy. Constructed on stilts over water, Neft Daslari has a rich history tied to oil production, but its future is uncertain as climate change impacts and changing energy policies threaten its viability. The piece explores the juxtaposition of its industrial legacy against the backdrop of growing awareness about climate issues and the need for sustainable practices in the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

One of our stops was supposed to be a fishing village, but when we got there, it was completely empty. Hundreds of mud huts sat abandoned as everyone had just disappeared. In one of the yards, a camel was still there. It felt haunting, like walking through a ghost town. The strangest part? There was no sea anywhere nearby! The Caspian had dried up so quickly that people had to leave their homes behind because they couldn’t live there anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is another very interesting field built over swamps and lakes in Siberia where they built the rigs on artificial islands.https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/99/42/41/1000_F_199424123_E5...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samotlor_Field?useskin=vectorhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/nq28Ct4FLyBGx5eP8It was deemed too strategically important and was not put on maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's another article about Neft Daşları with more photos: https://web.archive.org/web/20240225112359/https://guerrilla...Bing Maps shows the bridges and some platforms with good resolution: https://www.bing.com/maps?cp=40.061519%7E49.607735&amp;lvl=12.0&amp;...Yandex Maps shows the constellation of isolated platforms to the south-east: https://yandex.com/maps/?l=sat%2Cskl&amp;ll=49.630795%2C40.03939...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42060750</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article on audio decomposition by Matthew Bird explores various techniques and methods for breaking down and analyzing audio components. It discusses the significance of decomposition in understanding sound design and music production, detailing tools and software that facilitate this process. The author emphasizes the artistic and technical implications of dissecting audio, ultimately highlighting how these practices can enhance creativity and improve overall audio quality in various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is a bit confusing as open-source separation of ... reads like source separation, which this is not. Rather, it is a pitch detection algorithm which also classifies the instrument the pitch originated with.I think it's really neat, but the results look like it could take more time to fix the output than using a manual approach (if really accurate results are required).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't see it referenced directly anywhere in this post. However, for those interested, automatic music transcription (i.e., audio-&gt;MIDI) is actually a decently sized subfield of deep learning and music information retrieval.There have been several successful models for multi-track music transcription - see Google's MT3 project (https://research.google/pubs/mt3-multi-task-multitrack-music...). In the case of piano transcription, accuracy is nearly flawless at this point, even for very low-quality audio:https://github.com/EleutherAI/aria-amtFull disclaimer: I am the author of the above repo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in audio (or stem) separation have a look at RipXhttps://hitnmix.com/ripx-daw-pro/It can even export the separated tracks as midi files. It still has some problems but works very well. Stem separation is now standard in the musical software and almost every DAW provides it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098491</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Shader Blocks explores the concept of using shader programming in graphics and game development, focusing on the use of simplified "blocks" to create visual effects. It provides an overview of how shader blocks can be utilized to manipulate light, color, and texture in a more intuitive way. The content includes examples, tutorials, and insights aimed at helping both beginners and experienced developers understand and implement shader techniques in their projects. Overall, it highlights the creative possibilities and technical aspects of integrating shaders into digital art and design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple of suggestions.A clearer mechanism to indicate when a dragged component will fit into a cell of another node.   Quite often when you drag the highlighted drop area is obscured by the node you are dragging.pow(a,b) and abs(b), max(a,b), min(a,b) nodes would add a lot of functionality.Then you could do something like.    (((1 / abs((((0 - (y-0.5)) * 6) - ((sin(((((x-0.5) * 6) + time) * ((cos(time) / 3) + 2))) / 4) + pow(((x-0.5) * 2), 3))))) / 9) + (0 - pow((1 - min(abs((x-0.5), abs((y-0.5))), pow(9, 9))))

Which should generate a field with axis lines in negative numbers and a plot of x^3 modulated with a slight wobbly sine wave as positive numbers.as seen at https://c50.fingswotidun.com/show/?code=10v-6*u6*t%2Btc3%2F2...(note - in my thing u and v are shorthand values for 0.5-x and 0.5-y respectively)A perlin noise can add a lot too but not as trivial to add.  I have a compact perlin generator in the first few lines of https://c50.fingswotidun.com/fastStackie.js
which uses hashing to generate indexed random numbers, rather than a lookup table that sometimes gets used for Perlin.  Feel free to use the code if you understand any of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of node-based compositing, which is mostly standard in the film industry but, to the best of my knowledge, never made it to still-image editing applications. After doing things the nodal way, it’s hard for me to use Photoshop nowadays and have to bake-in certain changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of node based image editors https://gist.github.com/SMUsamaShah/c923a0af4543ee2746979328...But none of these is doing it all using shaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42039296</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered a unique skeleton comprised of bones from at least eight individuals, each having died thousands of years apart, at a site in England. This perplexing find raises questions about the site's historical use and the cultural practices of the people who buried their dead in this manner. Researchers are investigating whether the skeleton represents a ritualistic amalgamation of remains or a more practical approach to burial. The discovery highlights the complexities of ancient burial customs and the potential for new insights into human history and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe we should add some bones, bury the skeleton again and wipe all records of what we did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine you're just fucking around with something because you're bored and then leave it there and forget about it and 2000 years later archaeologists find it and wonder "how odd, I wonder what the deep significance of this might be"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Whether the assembly of the bones occurred in the late Neolithic or in the Roman period, the presence of the ‘individual’ was clearly intentional,” write the researchers.”I would like the researchers to explain to me what hypotheses they consider to suggest that in the Neolithic they had bones from the Roman period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097856</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the Frontier Math Benchmark, an evaluation framework designed to assess the mathematical capabilities of artificial intelligence models, particularly in areas such as problem-solving and numerical reasoning. It outlines the benchmark's structure, which includes diverse problem types and complexity levels, aiming to provide standardized metrics for comparing AI performance. The initiative seeks to enhance understanding of AI’s strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, facilitating advancements in AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some context on why this is important: this benchmark was designed to be extremely challenging for LLMs, with problems requiring several hours or days of work by expert mathematicians. Currently, LLMs solve 2% of problems in the set (which is kept private to prevent contamination).They even provide a quote from Terence Tao, which helped create the benchmark (alongside other Field medalists and IMO question writers):&gt; “These are extremely challenging. I think that in the near term basically the only way to solve them, short of having a real domain expert in the area, is by a combination of a semi-expert like a graduate student in a related field, maybe paired with some combination of a modern AI and lots of other algebra packages…”Surprisingly, prediction markets [1] are putting 62% on AI achieving &gt; 85% performance on the benchmark before 2028.[1]: https://manifold.markets/MatthewBarnett/will-an-ai-achieve-8...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding keeping the test set private to avoid contamination, the comments about leakage are spot on. The real test set should always be the future.We should evaluate LLMs on text from beyond their knowledge cutoff date, by computing their per-byte perplexity or per-byte compression ratio. There's a deep theoretical connection between compression and learning.The intuition here is that being able to predict the future of science (or any topic, really) is indicative of true understanding. Slightly more formally: When ICLR 2025 announces and publishes the accepted papers, Yoshua Bengio is less surprised/perplexed by what's new than a fresh PhD student. And Terence Tao is less surprised/perplexed by what will be proven in math in the next 10 years than a graduate student in a related field.This work has it right: https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html//2402.00861&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they solve the 2%? This is the question. If those problems were unseen, that might be already very impressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:02:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42094546</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the connection between procrastination and the fear of not being good enough, highlighting how this fear can lead to avoidance behaviors. It discusses the psychological factors that contribute to procrastination, such as perfectionism and self-doubt, emphasizing the importance of understanding these underlying issues to overcome procrastination.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suffered from this.The issue is the ego. Ego has a lot of ideas about itself and others. Ego has such high opinion about itself it only can do great work. Which prevents it from doing anything. It's kind of a way of avoiding failures. Because failures will break the grant ideas about himself OP has created.I accidentally went through a spiritual awakening which diluted ego. I have no problem in doing any kind of work now. Whether it's great or petty.OP needs to work on the ego. Or figure out a situation where OP has to ship things no matter what. Which is hard unless you are jobless and can't figure a way out apart from building useful things that people pay for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I struggle with this myself, especially around writing. My solution, from a coding perspective:If I had a massive new app to build, it would indeed feel overwhelming if I felt like I just had to sit down and build it. I think we get extra stuck on that with writing, as it often feels like we just need to go from an empty page to a well-reasoned and edited blog post, with a lot of ambiguous struggle in between.With programming, I start breaking it down into pieces of functionality, and smaller ones, until I have a list of concrete things I can actually get my head around and write the code for. I keep on doing those small things, build the structure around them, and eventually I have my app.I do the same with writing now. Not an outline really, but a list of concepts I want to get across, then smaller ideas. I write out a few of those, often a paragraph at a time. The structure starts to reveal itself, and soon enough I have a new blog post.I think the key here is arriving at something small enough that it doesn't feel overwhelming. New app or blog post feels like way too much in the moment, and my body and mind to everything possible to avoid it (procrastination). Writing out a paragraph, coding a function - very doable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will repeat my standard advice for writing more: lower your standards, and allow yourself (in fact force yourself) to publish things despite knowing that they could be better if you just changed a few more things...Also, write about things you've learned and projects you've built: both of those are topics where you aren't expected to provide shining new insight never seen before online: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101327</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a significant update to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, specifically focusing on enhancements to the "OAuth 2.1" proposal, which aims to consolidate and simplify the guidelines by integrating best practices from previous specifications. It outlines the changes being considered, such as the removal of legacy features, the introduction of new security measures, and the overall improvement of usability for developers.

First, standards you have to pay to obtain are a really, really bad thing. Second, I wish more effort would go into designing standards and implementations that aren't such an endless time sink when you need them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISO should be fined and abolished, and the money it took from taxpayers should be recuperated from the frauds that ran it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101181</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the nature of time and perception in relation to cultural and scientific influences. It explores how language and concepts of time shape our understanding of it, referencing literary works and philosophical ideas. The text delves into the complexities of time as both an abstract concept and a physical reality, encouraging readers to reflect on their own experiences and interpretations of time within various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

From their 'About' page:Immaterial Incorporated (aka Cabinet) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) art and culture organization founded in 1999. By operating with the most expansive and inclusive definition of “culture” possible, one that includes both the quotidian and the extraordinary, Cabinet aims to foster curiosity about the world we have made and inhabit. We believe that curiosity is the very basis of ethics insofar as a deeper understanding of our social and material cultures encourages us both to be better custodians of the world and at the same time allows us to imagine it otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then there's the metaphorical "handle": a horse that "has a handle on him" is so well trained that one can put him in every situation just as if he had had a handle and could be picked up and set down at will...(it might be interesting to explore the relations between this notion and "handiness", or to how we say cars "handle" well)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070630</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Anatomy of Quarks" by Aleksey Shipilev delves into the internal workings and performance characteristics of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), particularly focusing on a feature known as "quarks". It explores how these quarks, which represent a lightweight, low-latency mechanism for communication between the runtime and profiling tools, can significantly enhance performance analysis and monitoring in Java applications. The article provides insights into the implementation of quarks, their benefits, and their implications for developers looking to optimize their JVM processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Physical Intelligence (PI), which involves the ability to use one's physical body to interact with and respond to the environment effectively. It emphasizes the importance of body awareness, movement patterns, and the capability to adapt physically to various situations. The piece highlights how developing Physical Intelligence can enhance overall well-being, performance in various activities, and the ability to manage stress. Additionally, it may offer insights into techniques or practices for improving one’s Physical Intelligence in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The (unspoken?) goal is to do my laundry - and all the other domestic tasks, because that’s where human satisfaction can be unleashedGive me a moment1. All economics / markers of value are about human happiness / satisfaction - we claim it’s money but it’s only given a value by humans who want it.2. As soon as people get rich enough they outsource their domestic tasks - hire a maid or a cook, or buy ready meals.3. In the western world companies over past fifty years got a free boost as women joined the labour force, and essentially companies were paying one guy the cost of a household now they pay two people the cost of household getting twice the workers for same price.4. So most households have lost 35 hours a week, and also still have same amount of domestic duties to do5. As we can’t give everyone a maid we might be able to give everyone a robot maid.6. Most innovations / technologies find their way into homes - from bricks to heating to electricity we invent it and eventually find a way to make our lives more comfortable - see the point about economics is just humans liking stuff7. I assumed that real robo maids would be a social shift - ie a different design of washing machine, people eating at other peoples houses every day, anti-dust surfaces.  But this one looks … interesting8. I know this is incredibly western middle class centric - but exactly what else are 6 billon people aiming for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For factories and closed environments, stuff is getting good fast, but for the rest of the "real world", no robot or AI is practical without human supervision. I automate physical things for a living and have thus become convinced.The first thing that robot will do is start a dryer that a toddler climbed into because it isn't that aware of the world around it.And that will be the end of general purpose domestic robots.That or knocking over candles or fucking up something else simultaneously trivial and terribly dangerous in context.I dream the same dream of a general purpose machine, but I think it may never be possible, and if it is we're a long way out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hard problem for a laundry robot is not folding the clothes, it's getting into the laundry room.Living in European city, space is a hard constraint. The cost of rent is 30€ per square meter per month in Paris.Laundry rooms are small. This robot is too wide and won't be able to go through the door of my laundry room. Ironing boards are foldable for a reason : they need to be setup every time. This robot can't do it, and also can't handle the softener bottle for the washing machine.Having 1 square meter empty table (0.5 for the table and 0.5 accessible space for the robot doing the folding) dedicated to folding is a pipe dream for most. Laundromats are there because some don't have enough space to even have a washing machine.Laundry room are a dedicated space for humidity and ventilation reason, so they have been designed on specific location on house plans probably more than 30 years ago on average, not having in mind robot accessibility, but rather be as small as functionally possible.Quite often for people not living in flats, but in houses, the laundry room is located in the basement with only stair or single step access.I don't think architect and construction accessibility norm will change fast enough, specially with bipedal robots right around the corner.The slack necessary for home robotics emergence has already been eaten multiple time due to the high cost of space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:03:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098236</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;Jamcorder is a platform designed for musicians and artists to easily record, modify, and share their musical performances and collaborations. It offers tools for real-time recording, editing, and mixing, allowing users to add effects and enhance their tracks. The site emphasizes user-friendly navigation and community engagement, enabling artists to connect, collaborate, and showcase their work, while also providing resources and support for developing their musical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve automagically recorded my digital piano musings starting about 28 years ago. Initially, I used a simple C code on a Linux server using select to dump from dev MIDI to a timestamped file per session (a variation of an answering machine I had previously hacked together with a friend). Later, I used pianoteq recording on an iMac, which also detects gaps and records separate timestamped files. The experience has been very positive and helpful for improving technique and composition, so I do recommend this hardware if you dont already record everything.  One piece of advice, however: you want to let people who touch your piano know they get recorded, or ask them to wait until you turn off the recording. I tend to forget that I record everything after a while, and an unsuspecting friend might incorrectly assume that their improv does not lead to a permanent record. I had several people be surprised when they first learned about the automatic recording after the fact, and had to remove one or two files at their request (though the last time I needed to remove a file was around 1998; more recently, people didn’t seem to mind).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, looks amazing! (As someone nowhere near the target audience).Would love to see anything of the visualizer. Understand it’s beta, but curious what direction it would go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on launching, OP!This might be the first Show HN that I insta-purchased after reading your landing page.

&lt;p&gt;Chonkie is a lightweight, open-source library designed for developers to easily integrate a variety of customizable chart types into their JavaScript applications. The library focuses on simplicity and ease of use, providing options like line charts, bar charts, and pie charts with straightforward API calls. It encourages quick setup and supports data binding, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking for an efficient way to visualize data within their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it make sense for this to offer a chunking strategy that doesn't need a tokenizer at all? I love the goal to keep it small, but "tokenizers" is still a pretty huge dependency (and one that isn't currently compatible with Python 3.13).I've been hoping to find an ultra light-weight chunking library that can do things like very simple regex-based sentence/paragraph/markdown-aware chunking with minimal additional dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also check out https://github.com/D-Star-AI/dsRAG/ for a bit more involved chunking strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank you so much for giving Chonkie a chance! Just to note Chonkie is still in beta mode (with v0.1.2 running) with a bunch of things planned for it. It's an initial working version, which seemed promising enough to present.I hope that you will stick with Chonkie for the journey of making the 'perfect' chunking library!Thanks again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100819</guid></item><item><title>15.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Functionality and Features&gt; The Pi Board is an advanced automated chess system powered by a Raspberry Pi, utilizing an XY stepper motor mechanism and magnets to move chess pieces seamlessly across the board. The development process involved several key stages, including precise calibration of stepper motor coordinates, calculating the weight of each piece for accurate handling, integrating a robust chess engine, and optimizing piece-grabbing strategies and movement detection. Special attention was given to selecting the most efficient algorithm to minimize the stepper motors' power consumption.Is there a reason for the marketing speech? I'm assuming most people interested in this would rather read engineering speech, like so:&gt; The Pi Board, as the name suggests, uses a Raspberry Pi under the hood to calculate engine moves from &lt;Stockfish? Leela Zero?&gt;, and move the pieces with a series of stepper motors and magnets. We spent a significant amount of effort minimizing power consumption, including weighing the individual pieces to get more efficient grabbing and moving motions for each one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hate to be a spoil sport but if when pieces move they nudge other pieces out of the way and then those nudged pieces have to be put back by hand, then there’s still work left to be done. Same goes for capturing - the captured piece should walk itself off the board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories of Regium. A kickstarter scam 5 years ago that used realistic 3d animation videos of an automated chessboard to trick people out of their cash.chess.com happily took regium's money to advertise their scam to their audience.It eventually got kicked off kickstarter, and then kicked off some other kickstarter clones before self hosting their own kickstarter clone website. That was a wide ride. searching youtube for "regium chess board" will get a few hits.Pi board looks like a fun project that I'm sure will be refined over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101742</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The provided website presents the GenMC project, which focuses on the development of a tool called GenMC for automatic generation of software model checkers. The tool aids in the verification of concurrent programs by effectively modeling and analyzing their behavior, allowing for the detection of potential errors and ensuring reliability in software systems. GenMC is designed to handle various programming paradigms and provides features such as customizable semantics and efficient analysis methods, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in software verification and systems design.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From: https://github.com/MPI-SWS/genmc/blob/master/doc/manual.mdBasic UsageA generic invocation of GenMC resembles the following:genmc [OPTIONS] -- [CFLAGS] &lt;file&gt;...Note that, in order for GenMC to be able to verify it, file needs to meet two requirements: finiteness and data-determinism. Finiteness means that all tests need to have finite traces, i.e., no infinite loops (these need to be bounded; see Section 2.3). Data-determinism means that the code under test should be data-deterministic, i.e., not perform actions like calling rand(), performing actions based on user input or the clock, etc. In other words, all non-determinism should originate either from the scheduler or the underlying (weak) memory model.As long as these requirements as satisfied, GenMC will detect safety errors, races on non-atomic variables, as well as some memory errors (e.g., double-free error). Users can provide safety specifications for their programs by using assert() statements.**I wonder how much this affects usefulness. How often is this the case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098466</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the new features and improvements introduced in F# 9, focusing on language enhancements that increase productivity and usability for developers. Key updates include support for records with updates, improved pattern matching capabilities, and new type annotations that enhance code clarity. Additionally, it discusses benefits like better interoperability with .NET, expanded support for the Discriminated Unions, and features aimed at optimizing performance. Overall, F# 9 aims to streamline workflow and improve the development experience for F# programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;F# has been my favorite language since I first encountered it in uni. 
F# was/is waaaay out ahead of C# with features like unions, null safety, pattern matching, records, more powerful type inference and generic constraints.Over the years C# has been implementing these features too, which is good, but they have been implementing them in incompatible ways, which isn't very good. Since the investment in F# has been much smaller than in C#, it hasn't been innovating as fast as C# and has been left behind in some ways.But it is still a great language and remains broadly compatible with the ecosystem and can deliver equal performance to C# with far less boiler plate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There is also a new compile-time error for classes with over 65,520 methods in generated IL. Such classes aren't loadable by the CLR and result in a run-time error. (You won't author that many methods, but there have been cases with generated code.)The mind boggles.At any rate, F# is a terrific language. After excel, probably the second best thing Microsoft has ever released. Turns .NET into a reasonable platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, I made a large, multi-year company/technology bet on top of F# with Phosphor.After over a year of trying to make it work, we completely rewrote the application in Typescript and Rust. The product we're building is an end-user programming tool where the traditional lines between front-end and back-end work blur, and the .NET ecosystem really didn't lend itself well to this.Our hope was that we'd be able to use the Fable library to maintain type safety across a variety of technologies while being able to interop and in and out as needed: Fable compiles F# code to JS, Rust, .NET, etc. The reality was that the interop story between the various libraries we'd use was much harder to achieve than initially expected, and managing and updating multiple dependencies and their bindings was an absolute PITA.The assumption that F# makes for beautiful, efficient code is still a safe one, I think. But the ecosystem and the way that it was designed makes it (in my view) applicable only for applications and software that have very traditional frontend/backend lines. F# would be used for the back-end only in that case.Today, two of the technologies I'm most excited by (and which we're using internally) are the Effect library, whose Schema library fills in a lot of the gaps in TS's type system, and Moonbit, which is what I imagine a modern version of F# would like, free of the MS/.NET dependencies. Moonbit is really, really well designed (designed by the creator of OCAML's version of Fable, ReScript), and it compiles directly to highly optimized JS, WASM or Native output. We're using Effect in production, and not yet Moonbit, but the promise Moonbit holds as a language built for an AI-first world is pretty fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101312</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses typesetting engines, focusing on their role in producing high-quality documents and handling complex layouts. It explores various typesetting tools, including LaTeX, and compares features such as syntax, flexibility, and the ability to manage large documents. The piece emphasizes the importance of choosing the right typesetting engine based on specific needs, such as academic publishing or personal projects, and highlights the ongoing development and community support surrounding these tools. The discussion also touches on trends in typesetting technology and its impact on document creation.&lt;/p&gt;

Widely spoken indo-european languages includes English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and Spanish, etc.&gt; Indo-European languages typically use the Latin alphabetAfter the first sentence, "Indo-European" seems to have transformed to just "European" in the author's mind. Hindi and Bengali, languages more widely spoken than half the language in that list, seem to have been forgotten, along with their Devanagri script.(Over the course of the article, it's seeming like the author just wanted to say European languages, or languages using Latin script, and for some reason chose to use Indo-European instead, despite clearly stating the definition themself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most painful issues I encountered when building out a text layout engine for my JS 2D canvas library were:- Vertical text - in particular when it comes to how CJK punctuation differs in horizontal and vertical environments (not yet solved)- Staying on CJK, making sure the punctuation marks that follow a character don't break and remain with their preceding characters at all times. (I expect the same holds for opening quotes etc but haven't experimented).- Highly ligatured fonts - Devangari, Arabic, etc - there's no solution to styling individual characters within a word that I could find.- Talking of styling ... underlining text is a nightmare - especially if you want to get the little gap between hanging characters and the underline that HTML/CSS browsers do out of the box- Formatting Thai fonts ... is another World of Hurt[1][1] - https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/thai/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've written and published over a dozen books. (Two published with big tech publishers, the rest self-published.)With my most recent book, I've moved my PDF generation to Typst.

&lt;p&gt;The Web Locks API provides a mechanism for web applications to request and manage locks for shared resources, ensuring that operations on these resources do not conflict when accessed concurrently. This API allows developers to create exclusive or shared locks to prevent race conditions and inconsistencies in data handling. The documentation covers key concepts, usage patterns, and the methods available for lock acquisition and release, as well as potential use cases and best practices for implementing the API in applications.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; navigator.locks.request("my_resource", async (lock) =&gt; {This would be so much more readable with `using`  {
    using lock = navigator.lock('my_resource');
    await do_something();
    await do_something_else();
  }

(https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-managemen...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish the compatibility tables on MDN gave an indicator of when a feature became available.My ideal would be a thing that says "this hit 90% of deployed browsers 4 years ago", but just seeing the date it was added to each of the significant browser families would be amazingly useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why only in secure contexts? You can use storage APIs in insecure contexts, doing this by spinning, but the lock API which seems much more innocuous requires a secure context?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:04:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101434</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A piece of advice I've given junior engineers is to write everything twice. Solve the problem. Stash your code onto a branch. Then write all the code again. I discovered this method by accident after the laptop containing a few days of work died. Rewriting the solution only took 25% the time as the initial implementation, and the result was much better.This is true, and I've discovered it myself by losing a branch.However, who the hell has time to write everything twice? There's 1,000 things waiting to be written once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People learn to work better by reflecting on work.  So any framework for self-observation is better than none.I suspect that algorithms as a framework demonstrates the structural aspects (e.g., how some searches are more extensive), but might hide the driving factors. Indeed, the article examples were almost all hacking personality, not technical or process solutions.E.g., most over-engineered solutions are driven by fear, often itself driven by critical or competitive environments.  Conversely, much of the power of senior/staff engineers comes from the license to cut corners afforded their experience.  Or people use the tools they know.You can't get to great by holding onto good.  It's easy to go from bad to good, but takes some courage to toss good to start over for great.  The lesson there is that we stand (hide?) behind our work, and we need to let go of it to improve it.A meta-lesson is that managers need to deeply understand personal space of each developer and the social dynamics of the team before they can do their job effectively, and a key part of that is likely checking in with developers in a way that enhances their courage and self-observation instead of making them fearful and paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review: An anonymous "distinguished CEO and engineer" suggests if you can't complete a feature in a day, delete your progress (except for tests) and start again the next day.The author then recounts advice he gives to juniors, which is to stash the work and rewrite it, claiming that the next day the work will be rewritten in 25% of the time and 2x quality. This is unsubstantiated though. For juniors this suggests it will help them develop their capabilities to reason about implementations of problems without needing to face a a large amount of them.The author then gives another advice which is to ask for a solution to a problem then after the initial proposal, ask for a 24h solution. This is meant to generate "the real solution". He likens it the a path algorithm heuristic to reach your goal quicker.Overall the methods are not well discussed in terms of pros and cons, nor substantiated with experiments.Opinion: I think they may help some juniors who need to build up experience and may become stuck in development patterns. But they would rarely be useful to develop someone to be a senior, if all they do is chase fast implementations. In a way the post gives conflicting advice: write twice and write better, and think twice and think about the fastest way to achieve the goal, instead of engineering a problem.The author hasn't really convinced me of these approaches, and especially the last one smells of eXtreme Go Horse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101729</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the principles behind the Harrison timekeeper, a groundbreaking marine chronometer created by John Harrison in the 18th century. It highlights Harrison's challenges in solving the problem of measuring longitude at sea and details his innovative designs and timekeeping mechanisms, which significantly advanced navigation technology. The piece emphasizes the importance of accuracy and reliability in understanding time, illustrating the historical context and lasting impact of Harrison's work on maritime exploration and timekeeping accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A decent, short book on the historical story behind H4 (and the rest of Mr. Harrison’s time-keepers) is “Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time” by Dava Sobel. It goes into the longitude competition, the people involved, and how Harrison was able to (eventually) win with his timekeepers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uni. prof here/shameless plug: I developed a general education class for college students about the 'history of navigation' which includes the science behind navigation and why clocks and (accurate) timekeeping are needed for navigation.  I wrote a book about it all I use for the class, if anyone's interested: https://www.amazon.com/Longitude-Time-Navigation-Tom-Bensky-.... I was inspired by Sobel's book, but I needed more math and science in the discussions.Also, if you can find the book by Williams called "From Sails to Satellites: The Origin and Development of Navigational Science" you'll laugh out loud at his wit about navigation throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also cool from the same site: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/diaphragm-piston-air-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099778</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;Bjorn is a lightweight, flexible, and modern task automation tool designed to enhance developer productivity. It allows users to define and manage tasks easily, integrating seamlessly with existing tools and workflows. Key features include customizable task dependencies, support for various programming languages, and a simple syntax that simplifies task execution and automation processes. The tool aims to streamline development processes by reducing manual effort and enabling better task management within projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Also screenshots of the display look cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an absolutely stupid idea. You should never wire up service discovery tools directly to attack tools without a human doing some sanity checking.Anyone legitimately doing offensive security work knows that stupid automated scans are how you take down clients internal networks. Real testing does not involve stealing all the files you can possibly access, it means poking to see what might be useful for further exploitation and only grabbing a small sample for your report (primarily to limit your own liability).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101688</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of managing multiple projects simultaneously and the impact this has on productivity and focus. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing tasks and setting realistic timelines to avoid feeling overwhelmed. The author shares personal experiences and insights on overcoming the dilemma of juggling too many commitments, suggesting strategies for better organization and time management. Ultimately, the piece advocates for a more mindful approach to project selection and execution to enhance overall effectiveness and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I learned from running https://www.gnod.com (20 years) and https://www.productchart.com (10 years):Keep your stack flat.Most projects of my web developer friends died after months or a few years. None survived for decades. And the reason was always stack rot.Multiple parts of their stack became outdated and so hard to update that they quit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a problem for any project, and yet another reason to prefer static files for as much as your stack as possible and do not follow the latest tech-stack trends too closely. It is called the bleeding edge because it is covered in the blood of dead projects that cannot be maintained.My advice is to use as few technologies in your stack as possible. Sure, your project might work best with a relational db and a dedicated document store but it might be less ongoing effort to emulate one with the other.And freeze (or at least document) the versions of any dependencies for release. Your project runs fine with CoolTech.1.4 now but in 5 years when you come to rebuild you will find that the interface to CoolTech.6.44 is completely different.And even then things might fail. 20+ years ago I made some Java applets that were well received and useful. Technically they still work (I think) but nobody runs Java in the browser so those projects have been unusable for years. We can be smug about our pure HTML5 static sites now but who knows what the browser landscape will be like in 2050.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I generally agree with the thesis here.Adjacent points: I also think that selecting mature projects for your dependencies matters significantly. My old couchdb or early node work is generally defunct. On the other hand, I have some dotnet projects that are still functional with zero updates from a decade or more ago.Additionally, it's reasonable to keep a copy of your dependencies somewhere in case the vendor dies, the licensing changes, or something else catastrophic happens. Even if you just image dev's machines when they offboard. There have been a few times this has prevented permanent project death or rewrite emergencies for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101190</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The document provides an overview of the Memory64 proposal for WebAssembly, which aims to extend the addressable memory space from a maximum of 4GB to potentially 16 exabytes. This change is driven by the need for larger memory allocations to support increasingly complex applications. The proposal outlines key ideas, including a new 64-bit memory management model, backward compatibility with existing 32-bit WebAssembly applications, and potential impact on performance. Additionally, it discusses implementation considerations and the ongoing discussions surrounding security and interoperability in relation to this expanded memory model.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious to see what the performance impact of using 64bit memory ends up being. WASM runtimes currently use a clever trick on 64bit host platforms where they allocate a solid 4GB block of virtual memory up front, and then rely on the MMU to catch out-of-bounds accesses by faulting on unmapped pages, so bounds checking is effectively free. That won't work with 64bit WASM though so runtimes will have to do old fashioned explicit bounds checking on every single heap access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there movement on allowing larger memory usage for JS in browsers too? It's pretty limiting in some cases, say if you want to open a large file locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Safari: ?What an understatement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075403</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "Dobble," a popular card game that emphasizes quick recognition and reflexes. Each card features various images, and players must find the one matching symbol between their cards. The game fosters cognitive skills such as focus and speed, making it an engaging way for players of all ages to enhance their observational abilities. The author highlights various playing modes and the appeal of the game for both casual and serious gamers, emphasizing its educational potential and entertainment value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Gregor MacGregor, a Scottish adventurer and con artist who created the fictional country of Poyais in the early 19th century, promoting it as a paradise in Honduras. Despite lacking any real basis or legitimacy, MacGregor produced a detailed map and enticing descriptions to attract investors and settlers. His fraudulent claims led many to invest their money or emigrate, only to find the land did not exist as advertised, resulting in significant financial loss and hardship for those deceived.

&lt;p&gt;The article details the process of creating a latency tester, focusing on measuring the time it takes for a signal to travel through a system. It provides insights into the design considerations, equipment needed, and step-by-step instructions for building a custom device. The author explains the importance of accurate latency testing in various applications and offers practical tips for ensuring reliable measurements. Overall, the piece serves as a comprehensive guide for hobbyists and professionals interested in testing and optimizing system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it looks like input latency on current hardware still has not quite caught up with the apple IIe, but is better that the PET 4016, so not all the hardware progress in the last seven yeas has been eaten by software: https://danluu.com/input-lag/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that he openly discusses the paths he went wrong and how more accuracy could be found. Detection threshold from the sensor or avoiding accidental synchronization to the monitor are not obvious pitfalls. 
The mini ASCII histogram is something I need myself - nice thought!I remain puzzled on the goal. 
Does he optimize his setup for a good coding experience? (this should definitely include the actual keyboard in the measurements!) 
Is he optimizing editors? Picking a new monitor? As a learning excercise?I'm all for "because I can" as a valid reason, but that often leaves my projects dangling halfway complete. Are we there yet? Don't know - not sure where I want to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone wants to measure this latency without special hardware or code, check if your (friend's) smartphone has a 1000 fps mode. I'm not caught up with newer phones but my 2019 Samsung has this and I use it all the time to look at things that happen quickly.It just needs a lot of light (phone flashlight is sufficient at short range), or to emit light by itself like a screen (or microwave segment display, as a random example where you can see it lights up each digit individually and they're never all on at the same time, but we can't perceive that).Method:To measure, film the computer screen, positioning the phone in a way that it also captures the keyboard (best head on, since you're interested in when vertical movement stops). Press record, strike a key, and go frame by frame on the recording. The moment the key bottoms out is pretty clear by your finger stopping to move down (if the focus is good, you also see a ripple effect in your hand). I know the trigger point will be before the key's very bottom, but the whole key's travel time is on the order of 2-3 frames = ~2-3 ms, which is good enough for me. Then, count frames until the computer screen updates. I usually wait for all channels before considering it updated (my work laptop emits only red on a separate refresh cycle, sometimes noticeable if you look away with some lucky timing in the right way)Similarly for the mouse, though I usually pick it up and hold it in one hand before the screen and click the button in the air so that you can hold it in a good (for the camera) position more easily. By lifting your finger off the mouse button until the moment where you're going to press it, the separation is very well visible on camera and the moment of pressing quite exactly determinableResults:On the LUKS disk password prompt at boot, latency is about 19 ms on a laptop. It feels extremely fast, a little like it shows the asterisk before I've finished pressing the key. After booting the OS, in gnome-terminal I get 48 ms. Connecting an external screen and keyboard via a cheap USB hub, it grows to 62 ms. Finally, inside the virtual machines we're supposed to use for everything (because security), my input-to-photon latency is 134 ms. Guess I can see why that boot prompt feels like a time traveller compared to what I need to use all day long!On a different setup (a family member's iirc, running Windows) with an external monitor that has three gaming modes, called standard, fast, and faster, the latencies are 67, 67, and 62 ms. Pretty disappointing for a "low latency gaming" mode!---Compared to the submission:&gt; One source of latency users experience that my tester doesn’t measure is keyboard latency.The high speed camera method will include this, which is an advantage if you want to know how much latency your setup has, but doesn't help you in picking apart where the latency occurs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044426</guid></item><item><title>28.

It uses independent units of behavior, called bthreads, which are coordinated in a pub-sub protocol.[0] https://cacm.acm.org/research/behavioral-programming/ (2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like it could be promising for embedded and real time event handling.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite beefact™ is that each drone carries millions of identical sperm (i.e. male gametes created via mitosis); each queen only takes one maiden voyage, whereupon she typically chooses about a dozen suitors.Her spermathacea is able to keep isolated these dozen suitors' loads, and remembers both the order and the aggressiveness of each suitor (each's "rapiness"). Queen can then choose which sperm bank to use when fertilizing each egg (i.e. creating more female workers)...Through incredible (and largely unknown) mechanisms, queen typically develops sperm/suitor preference. Remembering the rapiness of each suitor, she can adjust hive's temperment (e.g. if skunks are robbing, be more aggressive).As she ages, she'll run out of "The Best Sperm" (remember: it's all stored for YEARS from one mating afternoon) and have to go to B-team, C-team, etc... until the workers choose to replace her (queen mandibular hormone output also greatly reduces as she ages, which gives the hive "identity").One day the Queen's Court will lead her to a queen cup, have her lay a fertilized egg within, ultimately sealing her fate [to be murdered by the princess queen upon her birthing, unless she is still healthy/young enough to be chosen to lead the next outgoing swarm].Source: beekeeper that has read too many books&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case you want to try honeybee experiments at home ... from the paper:https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953"Honeybee handling proceduresThe honeybees were collected from Apis mellifera carnica colonies (western honeybee) at the bee yard of the Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany. Female eggs were collected from naturally mated queens, which were maintained in small nuc colonies with five combs (Holtermann, Germany). To collect female eggs, the queens were caged in Jenter egg-collecting cages (Jenter queen rearing kit, Karl Jenter GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany). For the tracking, we collected newly eclosed bees (0 to 24 hours old) from a brood comb that was maintained in an incubator at 34°C. The laboratory rearing of worker bees was done as previously reported (19). We grafted the newly hatched larvae into plastic cups (#4963, Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) with worker diet # 7 (53% royal jelly, 4% glucose, 8% fructose, 1% yeast extract, and 34% autoclaved water) (74). To obtain bees with fully developed worker characteristics, we experimentally determined the amount of food provided, which was 170 μl per larvae. The larvae were kept at 34°C and 90% relative humidity. The latter was generated using saturated solution of K2SO4 (75). Before defecation, the larvae were transferred onto Kimwipe papers (Delicate Task Wipers, #066664, Kimberly Clark) and were kept in petri dishes for 2 days at 70% relative humidity, which we generated using saturated NaCl2 solutions (75). After defecation, the prepupae were separated into plates with 24 wells (#92424, Peter Oehmen GmBH, Essen, Germany) in which filter papers were placed (15 mm, grade 413; VWR, International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Once they started walking, they were marked and maintained in small cages together with eclosed wt workers coming from colonies (#20104; Imkereifachhandel Jasniak, Trossin, Germany) in which water and sugar paste supplemented with pollen (#7032; Heinrich Holtermann KG, Brockel, Germany) was provided. To obtain myrGFP-mutated worker or queen bees, we reared the queens as described (17, 76). To obtain myrGFP worker bees, 12- to 19-day-old myrGFP queens were inseminated with wt drones using standard insemination techniques. The queens were treated with CO2 1 day before insemination. Inseminated queens were maintained in small nucs (“Kieler Begattungskasten,” Holtermann, Germany) with wt worker bees. The nucs were kept in a containment so that mutated animals were not able to escape into nature. To obtain newly eclosed dsxmyrGFP/+ worker bees, combs with capped cells were maintained in an incubator at 34°C."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interesting insight led to their research (from the paper):
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3953(First, some interesting background:)"The evolutionary transition from solitary to social living in vertebrates and invertebrates led to sophisticated social behaviors. During the past 50 to 150 million years of evolution, sociality in some species became so elaborate that individuals in the group forego reproduction and changed their behavioral performance to embrace collective behavior, while others specialize in reproduction leading to the development of two castes, queen and workers (1, 2). From behavioral activities of hundreds and sometimes ten-thousands of worker individuals, new properties have emerged at the collective level such as shared brood care, warfare, collective thermoregulation, nest building, and farming, which contributed to the spectacular ecological success of the eusocial species (2). The collective tasks and functions cannot be performed by any single individual alone. They require a group and inherited behavioral patterns performed by individual workers."(And later ... [I added the paragraph breaks])"In advanced eusocial insect colonies, sophisticated innate behaviors establishing sociality are limited to the worker caste, not to queens. This led to our hypothesis that a dedicated developmental program for social behaviors will be found in the pathway determining the differentiation into the worker castes. ...Dsx proteins are part of the structurally and functionally conserved doublesex and mab-3–related transcription factor family (Dmrt) and are critical for sex-specific differentiation throughout the animal kingdom (39, 40) and sexual behaviors in insects (9, 41). DsxF is required for the worker-characteristic differentiation of the worker ovary, suggesting that DsxF is a component of the worker caste developmental program (19).The worker bees do not perform sexual behaviors. However, we found that dsx is also expressed in the worker’s brain (42) suggesting that the gene may have another role unrelated to sexual reproduction but related to promoting social living behaviors in the worker caste."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42055134</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This comment is not legal advice.  This comment is merely for educational purposes.The quote that you have about the 1997 patent, namely "U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,925 teaches a process for adjusting the deposition rate..." is from the specification.  That is written by either the inventors or more likely the attorneys filing the application.  The specification is not legally enforceable or binding.  It is supposed to disclose enough information to let somebody reproduce the claimed invention.  As a matter of practice, the specification can say almost anything it wants, including non-enforceable things.Only the claims are legally enforceable.  I suggest taking a closer look at the claims and seeing if these are problematic for your application or not.  You may want to consult an attorney if you have further questions.You can look up the patent examiner's reasoning for allowing the application here:https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17667081Click on "Documents and Transactions" and look for "Notice of Allowance and Fees Due".  Also look for the "Non-Final Rejection" for additional information from the examiner from an earlier version of the application.I should note that it does not appear that the patent examiner considered the 1997 patent directly relevant because they did not cite it in any of the office actions or specifically the PTO-892 forms (search the documents page for 892 to see what I'm talking about).  However, they likely did at least look at it since it is listed in the specification.Again, if you have further questions, you really should consult an attorney.  This is not a good forum for this kind of discussion, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant video on the subject, discussing brick layers, and the patents:https://youtu.be/9IdNA_hWiyE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real problem is that patent system seems ripe for abuse.  Even if the "invention" is not a valid patent, companies want to patent it anyway, as to force the other side to expend resources to prove it's not valid.There's a couple Bambu Lab patents that probably should not have been granted with prior art in open source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:06:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102235</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a fun paper, but very difficult to draw conclusions from. Their headline finding is that they created a map between resting state and "watching a movie".This is, for better or worse, the kind of research you can only do at institutions which have free fMRI scanning (MIT, Princeton, Harvard, etc.). No behavioural links, only very detailed activation maps that we can't really draw conclusions from. A missed opportunity IMO to spend these kinds of scanning resource on some kind of more narrowly focussed task with some behavioural outcome they can link to brain data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:07:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100645</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how DNA analysis of victims from the Pompeii eruption has uncovered unexpected familial and social relationships among the deceased, highlighting the complexity of their connections. While the disaster was catastrophic, the genetic data has provided insights into the individuals' origins and ties, revealing that many of the victims were not just random inhabitants but were likely linked through shared ancestry or familial bonds. This research expands our understanding of the population dynamics of Pompeii and the human stories behind the tragic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website offers an interactive time-travel experience using Google Street View, allowing users to explore historical images of various locations around the world. By selecting different dates, users can see how specific places have changed over time, providing a visual journey through history. This feature highlights significant changes in urban landscapes, architecture, and environments while engaging users in a unique way to learn about the past.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks less like a street view, and more like 360 images that link to one another. For example with future LA, I could only jump once forward and then back and the images didn't have any continuity between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the title should be "AI time-travel street-view" if it's going to have hyphens anywhere,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool but the interface could use some tweaks to be useable, or at least more consistent with actual Google Street view.  - transitions do not animate between camera positions
  - positions are spaced so far apart that it's not clear how they are connected.  Google Street View normally has many positions close together, so you always have a sense of where you are relative to your last position.
  - acceleration for spinning the viewpoint is too high, I kept overshooting my target and having to go back and forth, dropping down to a slower speed for accuracy.
  - the icons disappear when you click, which no explanation to get them back.  I didn't even realize they were off at first and just thought there weren't many icons
  - the "info" icon enlarges on hover, suggesting it's interactive if you click on it, but nothing happens
  - arrows on the ground would be nice

Some of these are a bit nit-picky, but if you're going to call it "Street View", then you set certain expectations.  If you're going for a different experience, it should be called something else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:07:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42075855</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I came into a company once that had built their own server room.  It had a couple hundred pizza boxes in it and was always hot as hell even with full blast air conditioning.  When I retired almost all of them to use virtual servers, it turns out that 1) a lot of the chipsets internallyl still had plastic film on them (to prevent scratches? Why would you put film on them? There were even some CPUs that didn't have any coolers on them, just film) and 2) A lot of the inpflow and outflow air ports also had plastic shipping film that was never removed.  I was completely shocked.  So I fixed dozens if not a hundred computers simply by removing a piece of tape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My 1070 is currently running with tape covering half of the PCIe pins so it works on x8 instead of x16.One day it stopped working. During troubleshooting it would work only on a 10 year old PC I had lying around. The difference? Despite being full-size, the GPU slot on the old mobo was wired only for x8.I reckon that the GPU die lost connection on some pins. Not worth fixing, x8 works fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently on a mission to tape a bunch of gear too. Though to cover LEDs. Why does consumer gear meant for houses look like a disco at night?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42103000</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses implementing pushed authorization requests (PAR) in ASP.NET Core 9, focusing on how this approach enhances security during the authorization process by allowing clients to send a request for authorization in advance without requiring user interaction. It outlines the necessary steps for configuring PAR in an ASP.NET application, including setting up the required services, defining endpoints, and handling authorization logic. The piece also highlights the benefits of using PAR, such as improved user experience and reduced risk of authorization code interception, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to implement more secure OAuth 2.0 flows in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to effectively handle the salary expectations question during job interviews. It emphasizes the importance of researching industry standards and understanding your worth before the interview. The author suggests strategies for responding, such as deflecting the question initially or providing a salary range based on market data. Additionally, the piece highlights the significance of confidence and preparation in negotiating salary to achieve favorable outcomes in job offers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always recommend this article: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
I think this topic is super important and I’m really glad I didn’t follow advice of saying your “expected salary or expected +20%”. Here my anecdotal SWE salary history:Worked at a startup for a bunch of years making 90k by the endGot offered a place at FAANG. Recruiter pushed me a little bit on expected salary but I didn’t give one using all the approached from the linked article. They offered me 250k. I would have never ever assumed that I can be payed this much. 
Instead of accepting I again followed the advice and asked for time to think. I had no counter offers but spoke to the recruiter thanked them for the offer and asked if there’s room for improvement. And they were nice and reasonable, they said yes if there are counter offers or you are leaving unvested stock behind. I was leaving unvested stock in an unprofitable startup, but I wrote the amount and vesting schedule and got offer bumped by 25k.After working there I considered going to trading shop. Used the same approach and they offered 400k. Again this number seemed insane at the time. So I asked for more, this time I had much lower counter offer. But I could use it as some form of leverage. They upped the offer by 150k by the end (this is sign on+ salary+guaranteed first year bonus).I am writing this not to show off the numbers, but to show other engineers that your idea of how much you should be payed could be completely wrong. Let the employer give information first and don’t back yourself into the corner by revealing your ignorance of market or minimum comp you are willing to take.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've talked to several recruiters and HR people who were prepared for quite a different answer than I gave to this question.I got the feeling that several interviews were carried out afterwards out of politeness or because the recruiter "had to" do it, but the interview ended before it began. Than, there's either ghosting or almost immediate (like up to an hour past the interview) copy-paste email along the lines of "we decided to go with another candidate".A few recruiters however were open that they've checked the salary for similar position in my country's capital city (Warsaw) and it's much lower than what I'm asking. Pointing out 20+ years of experience and listing accomplishments seems less important for a lot of businesses, than paying as little as possible.I got a few links to these "check salary for [level] [position] in [city]" websites from recruiters. All these seem to be crafted in a way that undervalues employees by artificially lowering country-wide salaries to ridiculous levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless you end up with someone like me who has a budget and always pays the max.I usually ask "what do you expect to be paid" to understand if I'll make them happy or sad when discussing what I'll actually offer.This is not foolproof and has caused some issues with people coming in as very good negotiators and thinking my inability to budge is because I'm being hard-line, when in reality it's because- as mentioned, I always offered the max for a role.The second issue is that not all people are equivalently valuable, but I think solving that in the salary is terrible, because salary should cover your compensation for responsibility. If you have to reward someone valuable then it should probably be via bonus' imo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:36 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101107</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the urgent need for effective conservation strategies to protect biodiversity amid rapid environmental changes. It emphasizes the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge with modern scientific approaches to create holistic and adaptive management plans. The authors advocate for collaborative efforts among various stakeholders, including local communities, policymakers, and scientists, highlighting case studies that illustrate successful conservation practices. The study ultimately calls for a more inclusive and dynamic framework to enhance conservation outcomes in diverse ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Rats have low training and maintenance costs, flexibly work with multiple handlers, have a long lifespan, and a sophisticated sense of smell. Their small size also offers unique capabilities for the screening of shipping containers, such as being able to navigate densely packed areas or be lifted to assess contents of sealed containers by screening ventilation systems. Future directions include assessing operational feasibility of deploying rats at ports.A fascinating read.  A team of  2 rats were able to get a 100% detection rate with very few false positives. Would be a transformative change for import customs if it translates to real-world settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42026468</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses updates to the Rust programming language's trademark policy, which aims to clarify the use of the Rust logo, name, and branding by individuals and organizations. The updates emphasize a more flexible approach to using the trademark in community projects while maintaining the integrity of the Rust brand. It also outlines the process for obtaining permission to use the trademarks, ensuring that Rust remains a recognizable and trusted technology while fostering community involvement and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part of the policy about distributing modified versions of the Rust compiler seems interesting:&gt; Publicly distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language, compiler,
or the Cargo package manager, provided that the modifications are limited to:&gt; - code adjustments for the purpose of porting to a different platform, architecture,
or system, or integrating the software with the packaging system of that platformIt looks like distributing a modified version with any change that isn't related to compatibility with a different platform/architecture/system is not allowed. This would probably make almost all GitHub forks of Rust non-compliant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This subject is a touchy one because it usually attracts a lot of people who are upset because they think they’ve lost something they had. A lot of those comments start with “I’m not a lawyer but …”Then all of these upset people writing angry comments creates an impression of drama. Then reaction streamers on YouTube read these comments out and get their viewers riled up over a non issue. That’s when the real drama starts.I’d urge people to remember that this policy is very similar to the Python Foundation. If Rust is doomed to be only as successful as Python that’s not a terrible outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The crates prefixes "rust-" and "cargo-" are no longer reserved to the Rust Project.Gosh they really should have used namespaces, huh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:08:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42101536</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), confirming that they have achieved significant milestones in natural language understanding and generation. It highlights the capabilities of these models to perform complex tasks, engage in coherent dialogues, and generate contextually relevant responses. The piece also reflects on the implications of these developments for the future of artificial intelligence, addressing both the potential benefits and ethical considerations that arise from increasingly powerful LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who followed Deep Learning in the 2010s would have guessed the same thing. Big boom with vision models by adding a lot of layers and data, but eventually there was diminishing returns there too. It’s unsurprising the same would happen with LLMs. I don’t know why people keep expecting anything other than a sigmoid curve. Perhaps they think it’s like Moore’s law but that’s simply not the case in this field.But that’s fine, LLMs as-is are amazing without being AGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- There _was_ a problem with diminishing returns from increasing data size. Then they surpassed that by curating data.- Then the limits on the amount of curatable data available made the performance gains level off. So they started generating data and that pushed the nose up again.- Eventually, even with generated data, gains flattened out. So they started increasing inference time. They have now proven that this improves the performance quite a bit.It's always been a series of S-curves and we have always (sooner or later) innovated to the next level.Marcus has always been a mouth just trying to take down neural networks.Someday we will move on from LLMs, large multimodal models, transformers, maybe even neural networks, in order to add new levels and types of intelligence.But Marcus's mouth will never stop yapping about how it won't work.I think we are now at the point where we can literally build a digital twin video avatar to handily win a debate with Marcus, and he will continue to deny that any of it really works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The context some commenters here seem to be missing is that Marcus is arguing that spending another $100B on pure scaling (more params, more data, more compute) is unlikely to repeat the qualitatively massive improvement we saw between say 2017 and 2022. We see some evidence this is true in the shift towards what I categorize as system integration approaches: RAG, step by step reasoning, function calling, "agents", etc. The theory and engineering is getting steadily better as evidenced by the rapidly improving capability of models down in the 1-10B param range but we don't see the same radical improvements out of ChatGPT etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097774</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember setting geofenced reminders maybe even 10 years ago ("remind me X when I'm near the supermarket") and they were pretty cool but sat squarely in that zone where they were useful enough to be interesting but not reliable enough that you could count on them (the number of times I got a reminder 5 minutes after I left a place was a lot) - so the applications where you could seriously use them sat in a very narrow band.This is probably one of a litany of missed opportunities I see where specifically Google missed the boat around 2010 - 2015. So much of what we have today they were already rolling out on phones as smart features ("Google Now" etc), and somehow it all faltered or even went backwards (I could reliably in set reminders by voice in 2013 I think, but by 2018 they were so unreliable I gave up).What I don't understand here is how they are going to do all this tracking and ambient AI without destroying your phone battery. I'm surprised Apple especially will even allow a background process to run that is doing that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gross.&gt; “The new company is building a service that leverages the enormous corpus of data in large AI systems and  newly ubiquitous headphones. Then it’s adding the capabilities of a smartphone to surface relevant local information as and when a person walks by a location, such as a restaurant, a cocktail bar, or even a street corner.”&gt; “He talks about attempting to make sense of it all while staying true to his original mission: building things that help people better experience the world around them.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not exactly certain if I want my headphones interrupting my train of thought as I walk down the street.  But I would actually like asking a question and getting an answer.  An AI that understood my preferences and my current location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:16 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097086</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Linux Asceticism explores the philosophy of minimalist computing and emphasizes the importance of simplicity, efficiency, and control in using Linux. It discusses the benefits of adopting a disciplined approach to software and system management, advocating for the reduction of unnecessary tools and distractions. The author encourages users to focus on mastering essential skills and tools, promoting a more profound understanding of their systems and fostering productivity through minimalism. Overall, the piece serves as a guide for users seeking to enhance their Linux experience by prioritizing simplicity and intentionality in their computing practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s funny, I feel quite the opposite. Using windows is a form of asceticism, and Linux is the easy way. Everything just works under Linux, but under Windows, things go wrong for no apparent reason, the system installs updates and reboots without me telling it to, there is massive network traffic that I didn’t initiate, none of my tools work properly, there are ads on the start menu, and software I know I installed is nowhere to be found. Talk about mortification of the flesh! Nothing humbles you like being subject to Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get it, for me a computer is a tool. I want to get away from it as fast as possible, having to tweak the environment is a waste of time .That's why I like macos so much, nothing is perfect but I know that whatever I do there are tools somewhat easy to use .For instance I wanted to read an epub on my computer that runs windows, believe it or not but finding a good or even descent epub reader is a nightmare. Wasted a lot of time before settling on FB reader.On mac, you just have the book app. It's not perfect, when you export highlights for instance it always add 'copyright blabla' but it's good enough for my casual reading.Same for pdf, you want an app that can read pdf and do some basic stuff like reorganize pages or compress them. On Mac there is preview, on windows ? Edge can just read and it's a browser, adobe is paid software and install a lot of junk.And you repeat that for basically everything it's such a waste of time.Linux is even worst than windows on that matter.If you are looking for that kind of 'experience' like the author, i suggest hitting yourself on the balls with a hammer. That would be quicker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was unsurprised to find Arch and NixOS mentioned, they're more or less for asceticism, and they usually show up on the ascetic's path. But having learned the power of going without from Linux, there's a lot of similar places to go besides an increasing difficult progression of Linux distributions.Repeatable Builds is something that can be practiced without Linux, but which the Linux ascetic will find pleasingly austere. Working with immutable data send like another. And then there's all the ways one can avoid using a pointing device, or not buying things your can't hack...It's a path that Linux can teach you to to walk, but it's not Linux's path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:26 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42099398</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various text file formats, specifically focusing on ASCII delimited text as a more suitable alternative to traditional CSV or tab-delimited formats. It highlights the limitations of these common formats, such as issues with encoding and special characters, and advocates for the use of ASCII, which provides better control over data representation. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing the right format for data integrity and accessibility, and provides insights on how to implement ASCII delimited text effectively in data handling practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; with no restrictions on the text in fields or the need to try and escape characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but wouldn't it still need escaping for those ASCII separator characters (or alternatively, a restriction for the stored text not to have them)?It's true that having to deal with escaping much less often (since the ASCII separator characters are rarer than commas/quotes) would be convenient for manual reading/writing, but I feel that's canceled out by the characters being hard to type/see (likely the reason why they're rare) - and it wouldn't necessarily save on writer/parser code complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this format best of all, CSV is # 2 favorite.At work we settled on using ^G (0x07) as a delimiter instead of TABs for file transfers and loading data into various databases.The reason was Excel.  People/systems who create these files sometimes source from Excel.  And Excel can have a habit of placing odd characters in text fields.  We found the one character never encountered was BEL.For text fields we tend to remove embedded white space and after replacing TABs with 1 space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the early 2000s, back at the beginning of the world, Yahoo's web code used ^A and ^B for field and record separators to avoid having to escape commas and quotes and newlines. That was probably the last time I ever saw ASCII control characters used as intended in the wild.There is no technical reason why CSV should have won out, except that keyboards have a comma key and almost never a ^A key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:46 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100499</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel your pain. I have been making things like this in Go;https://github.com/tluyben/go-proxyhttps://github.com/tluyben/redis-sentinel-proxyjust to make them easier to instrument for my experiments. The first one I made because after trying all tutorials on haproxy/nginx to make proxying work without the target domain being resolvable (so no dns entry until it's up), I got annoyed (nothing worked while everything only and gpt said it should work) and just did it like this. Also it makes it very easy to throw in my own, complex as I want rules and logging and telemetry (to whatever I want) at any level.The second I needed to test an existing, not able to change (they have an old version running they cannot update at the moment, don't ask) software against a redis sentinel setup.The main thing is that I am more and going towards having the program language as config instead of greenspun's tenth rule where everyone builds some annoying and limited 'almost (usually esoteric) programming language' as config language over time. I want that hard lifting to be done in my native language (Lisp, Go, Rust) and have the config be for ip addresses and ports only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would expect my web application framework to handle all of these tasks, except perhaps header filtering. If it didn’t I’d rather fix that problem in the web application itself instead of adding a complicating layer of infrastructure that I now need to include in integration tests and release process.I see some merit to moving the size limits etc out of the application to reduce CPU waste there on overly large requests, but either way I’m still burning some CPUs on it.Is the use-case for this mostly about sticking some validation in front of a system who’s code you can’t or don’t want to modify for some reason, like in front of Wordpress?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Won't the fact that it's written in Python make it too slow for high traffic sites or APIs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:09:56 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42097735</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Lambda 0, a concept in functional programming where a function can be treated as a first-class citizen without any context or parameters. It explores how this concept relates to the notion of pure functions and the implications for programming languages and paradigms. The author provides examples and explanations of how Lambda 0 can enhance code simplicity, maintainability, and readability, making a case for its utility in modern software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nice way to think about eta-reduction is that it asserts something about the types of expressions in lambda calculus, namely that every expression is in fact a function.If an expression M can appear in the left position of the function application operation, this implies that M is a function.By way of analogy, if I have a formula x == x+0, this implies that x is a number.Or, s == s + '' would imply that s is a string.So, if M == lambda x. M(x), this is saying that M is a function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What follows the lambda is the list of arguments.It would be clearer to say that what follows the lambda is the name of its (single) argument, not a list. And then explain that for notational convenience, you could abbreviate successive abstractions. Btw, if you really base it on lists, then do you allow an empty list as well?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:10:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100107</guid></item></channel></rss>
