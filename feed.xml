&lt;p&gt;The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple's Knowledge Navigator from 1987 still feels distant. Legacy, ad-based search has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans. Path forward requires solving the core challenge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the Apple M1/M2 GPU driver, along with some news about the kinds of games it can support. The driver is written in Rust, but it has achieved conformance with various graphics standards. The hardware tessellator cannot be used at all when those algorithms are being emulated in the software. Instead, "we use software" that was meant to show vendors what they were supposed to implement a decade ago, Rosenz weig said. She is not sure whether that is a problem in practice or not, so she is not hoping to have to go that route. She also talked about geometry shaders, because "that was the next step"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Update on Apple M1/M2 GPU Drivers (lwn.net) by MrBuddyCasino. A quick look at the specs shows the 14" Thinkpad X1 Carbon at 2.7 lbs, 13" MacBook Air at 27 lbs and a 14" E-pad at 317 lbs. The M4 macbook announcement comments was how many people were happy with their M1 laptop. Apple is incredibly difficult and expensive to repair. But I have been pleasantly surprised by the longevity and repairability of ThinkPads. MacBooks are going to be lighter, better battery life, and have better displays. Thinkpads usually have great Linux support and swappable hardware for those who like to tinker with their devices. They also tend to be more durable, but this adds more weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZBar is an open-source library for reading barcodes written in C. It supports an impressive number of barcode formats, including QR codes. One of our clients used it, so we wanted to quickly assess its security. Given the extensive amount of code, manual review was not an option. To fuzz ZBar, it has to be built with sanitizer and fuzzer instrumentation. We found serious bugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42006698"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuzz testing only rose to prominence in ~2012 with the rise of tools like afl-fuzz. ZBar by default scans all code types, which means that an attacker can trigger a bug in any of the scanners. If you owned a store with a POS setup with flaky reader behavior like this, you could try reconfiguring the reader (to, say, disable QR support). This reprogramming can sometimes be done via documented protocol, via sketchy Windows software, or via... barcode... Careful you don't make it worse. The reader's firmware tend to have multiple modes and many options. Some modes are as simple as "scan whatever you see out of the many formats you support, and spit out the decoded value of something as USB Serial". Or, worse, "...as USB Keyboard".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazel is a live functional programming environment organized around typed holes. It is able to typecheck, manipulate, and even run incomplete programs, i.e. programs with holes. There are no meaningless editor states. Hazel serves as an elegant platform for research on the future of programming (and programming education). We are developing a more principled approach to working with incomplete programs. We are first implementing these ideas into Hazel, a web-based programming environment for an Elm/ML-like functional programming language designed around typed-hole-driven development. We will focus on turning Hazel into a classroom assistant. This will start with a keynote by Cyrus on Research Methods for Next-Generation Programming Systems for teaching and learning in the classroom. We hope to have a Hazel-based classroom assistant by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timezones are weird. But only finitely so. Here's the exact conceptual model you should have of them. Australia/Lord_Howe is the weirdest timezone. America/Nuuk does daylight savings at -01:00 (yes, with a negative) America/Cairo and America/Santiago do it at 24 o’clock (not 0 o'clock) Asia/Kathmandu has a weird offset from UTC. Africa/Casablanca doesn’t fit into the timezone model cleanly, so it’s hard-coded. The Gregorian system is called the proleptic Gregorian calendar and isn't historically accurate except Russian revolutionnerds. It does one thing very well: It does not let the months drift around the seasons like the Roman calendar did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41992314"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tz database refuses to calculate timezone transitions occurring before the Big Bang. Glib computes Sao Paulo time stamps as if Brazil's circa-1913 rules were still in effect. Work around the bug by not generating time stamps equal to -2**63. There used to be a long manpage about linux/unix `date` and what dates meant in the past - with examples of 15 century and so. But i can not find it anymore. Anyone has an idea ? Is it gone completely? I'm a little skeptical of the tz algorithm's thinking about pre- Unix-epoch thinking. It's a good way to head off "angels dancing on the head of a pin"-style arguments between contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security through obscurity is almost universally discouraged and considered bad practice. I am more than happy to have devices be locked down by default. My life has gotten much easier since I got my elderly parents and non-technical siblings to move completely to the Apple ecosystem. Lock-in and planned obsolescence are also factors, and ones I'm glad the EU (and others) are pushing back here. But it isn't as if there are no legitimate tradeoffs. I think simple obscurity is more powerful and requires less resources than obscure strength based security. I’ve managed public servers that stayed uncompised for a decade or more using an archaic old Unix some type that does not respond to pings or other queries, runs on non-standard ports, and blocks routes to hosts that don't even attempt to scan the standard ports. For example, Intel's Management Engine, was also using a very obscured OS with updates on top of these techniques is better overall overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam games will now need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat on store pages. Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.19 Beta finally released. Fanatical bundles for Quake II finally released with a big content update. Steamworks Developer post: "We've heard from more and more developers recently that they're looking for the right way to share anti- cheat information about their game with players" Valve will be doing checks on games to ensure the notices are there and correct. If it's only client-side or server-side, it's optional, but Valve say "we generally think that any game that makes use ofAnti-Cheat technology would benefit from letting players know" Steam Deck / Desktop Linux will be easier knowing what to avoid on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux now too.&lt;/p&gt;

More than 6,000 people have commented on this article. More than 1,000 of those comments have been posted in the last 24 hours. The article was originally published on November 2, 2013. It has been updated on November 3, 2013, to include the latest information on Steam's anti-cheating feature. The original version of this article stated that Steam games would have to include a kernel extension. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case, and that Steam will not be required to include such an extension on its stores. We apologise for any confusion caused by this article, and we are pleased to clarify the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999340"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chain-of-thought can hurt performance on tasks where thinking makes humans worse. We know LLMs are more than just words, just because you say something doesn’t mean it’s true. Multimodal LLMs have been shown to significantly outperform classic LLMs of comparable size. It happens that we encode and assign a lot of meaning in words that appear to have this intent, even though they can't replicate it. Any reasoning we’ve ever seen is based on probabilistic text generation. Humans are not carefully writing out all the words of this implicit reasoning, so the machine cant appear to mimic them. What am I missing that makes this debatable at all? I am baffled that people have to continue making this argument over and over andover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google CEO says more than a quarter of the company's new code is created by AI. The quote is clearly meant to exaggerate reality, and they are likely including things like fully automated CL/PR's which have been around for a decade as "AI generated" I don't think it would be politically savvy to admit it. Claiming to replace humans with AI would attract the wrong kind of attention from politicians (during an election year) and from the public in general. Most people aren’t so to class warfare as long as it stomps on a rich guy. It’s a disservice to the public to assume they aren't capable of understanding why AI job losses might be concerning, even if they aren�'st directly impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AI Flame Graphs is a visualization that shows an AI accelerator or GPU hardware profile along with the full software stack, based on my CPU flame graphs. The flame graph is dominated by the slowest implementation, multiply_basic() which doesn't use any optimizations. It is a prototype based on EU profiling for low-stall hardware and eBPF software. The first version is available to customers in the Intel Tiber AI Cloud as a preview for the Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (previously called Ponte Vecchio). Here is an example: SYCL matrix multiply microbenchmark. The green frames are the actual instructions running on the AI or GPU accelerator, aqua shows the source code for these functions, and red (C), yellow (C++), and orange ( kernel) show the CPU code paths that initiated these AI/GPU programs. The gray "-" frames just help highlight the boundary between CPU and AI/ GPU code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; AI Flame Graphs (brendangregg.com) by JNRowe 4 days ago  | hide | past | favorite | 89 comments. JNRowe: I found that the detailed info you'd want from Nvidia was just 100% unavailable. The more hopeful sign is that a lot of the major customers of Nvidia are going to start demanding this sort of access and there's a real chance that AMD's more accessible driver starts documenting what to actually look at, which will create the market competition to fill this space. In the meantime, take a look at the flamegraph capabilities in PyTorch and similar frameworks, up an abstraction level and eek what performance you can get from them. The problem is that CUDA already does that, and they're not incentivized to really improve from that baseline, given the capability and ease of use of the ROCM or Intel solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42000784"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News: OpenZFS deduplication is good now and you shouldn't use it. The problem is that physical locations are hashed into the Merkle hash tree, and that makes moving physical locations prohibitively expensive as you have to rewrite all the interior nodes on the way to the nodes you want to rewrite. I want "offline" dedupe that doesn't require the pool to be fully offline, but doesn't happen immediately. I just wish we had some data corruption from bugs in the Windows R2 timeframe in the 2012-2013 timeframe. I'm generally happy with it when the underlying hardware is sufficient. It's very RAM/O hungry but you can schedule and throttle the "groveler".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google can flag accounts as CP, but then a judge still needs to issue a warrant for the police to actually go and look at the file. Maher's conviction, based on the warrantless search, still stands because the court found that the "good faith exception" applies. The threat to people posed by incompetent or tyrannical police is arguably much greater than the threat posed by ordinary criminality. In small towns across America, corrupt police departments issue minor citations as a way to generate revenue. Many US police officers act with impunity because their misconduct will be protected by local prosecutors and judges. There are absolutely towns and neighborhoods and judges and good people should avoid because of the police. If someone is found to be guilty of civil misconduct, they often have large amounts of cash for some reason they often will confiscate it in a process called a civil civil process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; vector databases are the wrong abstraction, says jascha_eng. The most significant drawback to putting your embeddings in a Postgres database with all your other data is that the workload looks so different. The canonical solution is to move your data into another database, but then you've recreated the consistency problem that your solution purports to solve. Can you take advantage of partial indices on the underlying data? Are some of the limitations in pg vector's HNSW implementation (as far as filtering goes) still present? Thanks for your feedback. I hear you on using a read-replica to serve embedding-based queries. I worry there are lots of cases where that breaks down in practice: presumably you still need to do a bunch of IO on the primary to support insertion, and presumably reconstituting an index (to test out new hyperparameters) isn't cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Crafting Painterly Shaders - Maxime Heckel's Blog@MaximeHeckelOn crafting a WebGL shader that can reproduce the look and feel of aquarelle, watercolor, or gouache to obtain a more painterly output for WebGL scenes. The Kuwahara filter is a smoothing filter that can transform any image input into a painting-like work of art. We will go through the characteristics of the filter that make it so great at transforming our work into paintings, as well as look into several techniques highlighted in the many papers I read to improve the original implementation and have it return a sharper, and more anisotropic output. Finally, we'll go through a bit of color correction and the use of textures to achieve a satisfying and accurate painting effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with provided texts, current models still hallucinate. How well can you judge the quality of a response on a topic you know nothing about? You cannot, but those pushing Gen AI wave away the probability and liability for obvious reasons. Sell the magic, it'll be someone else's problem when it doesn't deliver. "Fake" works fine for some things, but a large chunk of what they're trying to sell AI for doesn't work. It's not clear to me why we’re still trying to encode all of human knowledge in a single model, instead of teaching the model how to look for answers from an external source (e.g. RAG). You shouldn't use the rate as an indicator. They did something similar to what I did on my hallucinations benchmark (https://github.com/lechmazur/confabulations/), only using questions where at least one model made a mistake. This just makes me think LLMs must be wrong far more often than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running 1BRC was immensely fun, I learned a ton from it. One main take-away for me was that you could improve performance by one order of magnitude over the baseline basically by just doing a good job and avoiding basic mistakes. The resulting code is still well readable and maintainable. Write good code in go / c# / Java / JavaScript / etc and 99% of the time, performance will be just fine. But there’s usually 10-100x more performance available if you really try. Just writing crdt code in a straightforward, correct way, without unnecessary allocations (and ideally using some good data structures) will get you very, very far. There's another order of magnification available to anyone interested in using exotic, task specific data structures. If you want some examples, I highly recommend Algorithms for Modern Hardware, available for free online:https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Graphics &amp; Programming with Pekka Väänänen: Classic 3D videogame shadow techniques. In games shadows are both engineered and designed to run well but also look good. In Super Mario 64, the blobs are drawn using a special hardware feature that effectively clips the shadow to show up only on the ground plane. In Metal Gear Solid, the shadow becomes smaller when jumping and in Crash Bandicoot, it changes shape when the character is moving. In the real world, shadows simply exist but in games they are bothengineered and designed. In 3D, shadows are something else. It’s easy to paint a dark blob under some character’S feet and assume everything else is lit. In 2D, you can draw a shadow image to the screen before you draw acharacter. On-screen 2D shadows are just a 2D image without any scaling. The blob and usually textures can be rendered to render at just a texture is just a circle and use that instead of a circle. This works great in Crash 3D (video) but not so well in Fortune Fortune (Soldier of Fortune) because they kept the shadow resolution so low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarize this text in two paragraphs that capture the main points. Classic 3D videogame shadow techniques (30fps.net) ibobev: My favorite shadow fact is that outdoor shadows are blue. A “good graphics engine” is only as good as the eyes that implemented it. The traditional (cheap) way of lighting stuff is to model ambiant lighting as some constant, regardless where light actually comes from, and render shadows as dark patches. It is not at all how physics work, so you need an artist with a good sense of observation to make it look right. An artist can still be involved in evaluating corner-cutting techniques, but his job will be more about evaluating stylistic choices and techniques. Even Maxwell’s equations are a much broader set of interactions than you’d get a few decades ago. You don’t think there is all that is physically based rendering, but there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the influence of Japanese archaeological heritage on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Journal of Geek Studies. In Ocarina of Time (1998), time is an effective gameplay element, and the player can travel through two different timelines. The player alternates between embodying young Link and adult Link, each with a distinct perspective. Fragments of the past are in fact materially dispersed in Hyrule. The recurrence of this type of conflict is a commonplace of fantasy worlds, and a convenient way to turn the lore of these games into repeated iterations of commercial successes. This definition fits the Zelda series, as each opus is a reinvention of the Link/Zelda trio. Here, the game enters the realm of geological time, a curious mixing of both linear and circular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Influence of Japanese Archaeology on the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (jgeekstudies.org) The best thing about being in Japan is realizing that games so often are recreating Japan ... and you don't realize it until you're there. Tokyo is not really a single city but a prefecture, it is like a bunch of smaller cities (wards) stuck together, and there are 23 of them. Tokyo-Edo museum is indeed awesome if you are interesting in the history of the city, and it certainly a "do-not-miss", but on a 24-hours stay, you have to make choices. Shibuya crossing is one of the most famous sights of Tokyo and a symbol of the busy city it is. It is also right out of the station on the Yamanote line, so close to other notable places, such as Harajuku, Yoyogi, and Shinjuku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA reconnected with Voyager 1 after a brief pause. AFAIK Pioneer and Voyger probes were still using PSK and FSK. How can adding more steps, more processing time, possibly longer distances if these hops are not in a straight line, cause a decrease in latency? More hops = more latency. You cannot alter throughput. You can only broadcast at high power from one side of the space.Deep space RTT is unavoidable. The fastest way is astraight line between origin and destination. The best way to get around the problem is to add more hops. The quickest way to solve it is to increase the number of hops, or add more data channels, or change the way the data is sent and received. The most effective way to fix it is by adding more hops or by changing the way data is transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the Italian ‘Fruit detective’ Who investigates Renaissance paintings for clues about the disappearance of cherries from Italian orchards. The fruit was once abundant in Italy, but now all the cherries in Italy are gone. The discovery could help combat a growing agricultural crisis in the country. In the U.S., the fruit could be used as a tool to help solve problems in the agriculture industry. In Italy, the fruit may be used to help combat the agricultural crisis, but it may also be used for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of efforts in the US and England, both govt (e.g., USDA) and private, working to preserve these often rare cultivars. There are hundreds of local / regional cultivars grown for a variety of specific purposes (way beyond today's mass-marketed four or five varieties) Many farms had an orchard, which consisted of a few to a few dozen trees, each with different cultivars cloned by grafting. Different varieties were good for different purposes, such as eating directly (dessert apples), baking, storing, cider, producing early or late, etc. These varieties really do make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch HN: FlyCode (YC S22) – Stop losing revenue due to failed payments. FlyCode makes it easy for subscription-based companies to recover lost revenue. When a payment fails, it doesn’t just cost immediate revenue; it significantly impacts the customer’s lifetime value (LTV) and customer experience. With FlyCode you can recover more payments with (1) fewer payment retries (2) faster average days to recovery (3) less customer communications (4) compliant with the Card networks rules [we partnered with Visa] (5) and coordinate the communications with the retries automatically for each customer. On top of that, solutions like Card Account Updater (CAU) and Network Tokens help to automatically update card details when a new card is activated or an expired one is replaced. We built apps in Stripe and Shopify https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/flycode-payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox CEO Drew Houston sent an email to all employees. He said the company would be reducing its global workforce by approximately 20% or 528 Dropboxers. He also said that the company was making more significant cuts in areas where it was over-invested or underperforming while designing a flatter, more efficient team structure. The email was published on October 30, 2024, on the Dropbox blog. It is available to all Dropbox employees on the company’s website, as well as on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. It was also published on Dropbox.com, the Dropbox app, and the Dropbox Blog. It has been removed from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It will be available on the Microsoft Store, the Amazon.com App Store, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same forces that enable high tech salaries, also make layoffs more likely. The market for talent is competitive. Companies allow things like remote work, which is a perk, but also has a lot of abuse in terms of how much work gets done. Even with savings, getting laid off is highly disruptive, and, if done as part of a broader downturn in the market, you may never recover the required cash flow to enable your lifestyle. There should also be some reasonable government provided safety net so people can reskill/learn and move to other fields. There are also different types of creep, some that you can easily stop, and others that are more difficult. The first potentially for spending more money on restaurants and broadway shows are all potentially gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like LEGO provides 3D models for their components (e.g: via Bricklink [1]). Wouldn't it be easier to generate the training data with a rendering pipeline of some sort that randomizes the brick position in a 3D scene with different lighting? There is some code to generate Lego images from Lego 3d files here and use it to train models. It is based on this post (which others have mentioned)https://jacquesmattheij.com/sorting-lego-the-software-side/RebrickNet – Lego Part Detector (rebrickable.com)107 points by wonger_ 4 days ago  | hide | past | favorite | 40 comments   RebrackNet – Lego Partdetector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek v2.5 is an open-source LLM comparable to GPT-4, but 95% less expensive. It is politically neutral in an interesting way. When asked “Where is Taiwan?” it prefaced its answer with “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. ” When asked if anything significant ever happened in Tiananmen Square, it deleted the question. DeepSeek doesn't seem capable of handling image uploads. It claims to be able to handle images, but it's just not working for me. It's interesting to see which ones it answers with the party line (gongunie, or if Xi Jinping looks like the Winnie the Pooh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AI Flame Graphs is a visualization that shows an AI accelerator or GPU hardware profile along with the full software stack, based on my CPU flame graphs. The flame graph is dominated by the slowest implementation, multiply_basic() which doesn't use any optimizations. It is a prototype based on EU profiling for low-stall hardware and eBPF software. The first version is available to customers in the Intel Tiber AI Cloud as a preview for the Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (previously called Ponte Vecchio). Here is an example: SYCL matrix multiply microbenchmark. The green frames are the actual instructions running on the AI or GPU accelerator, aqua shows the source code for these functions, and red (C), yellow (C++), and orange ( kernel) show the CPU code paths that initiated these AI/GPU programs. The gray "-" frames just help highlight the boundary between CPU and AI/ GPU code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Burton was just 27 when he was put in charge of creating Thorpe Park’s biggest-ever project. Once too scared to go on rides himself, how did he become the architect of so many daredevils’ dreams? He was given an £18m budget, a patch of damp ground, and told: make it big. Curiosity became an obsession in his teens, when he started to play RollerCoaster Tycoon, a computer game that allowed him to devise his own rides. He took the job in the aquarium while studying architecture at Birmingham City University. He went through interviews, almost ruining himself on the train to London. In the end he won the job, he said, on the strength of those speculative rollercoasters he had made in a video game. That year, Nick Varney, the CEO of Merlin Entertainments, decided to demolish an old video game and build a rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple's Knowledge Navigator from 1987 still feels distant. Legacy, ad-based search has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans. Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see. This means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients. I do not see a way around this. I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the Apple M1/M2 GPU driver. She also gave some news about the kinds of games it can support. The driver has achieved conformance with various graphics standards, which is noteworthy. The hardware is too limited to implement any of the standards; it is "pretty much useless to anybody who is not implementing Metal", she said. The real problem is with transformback and geometry shaders, neither of which is supported by the driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Update on Apple M1/M2 GPU Drivers (lwn.net) MrBuddyCasino: Too many projects get dropped the moment the next shiny ray-traced toy comes along. Thinkpad usually have great Linux support and swappable hardware for those who like to tinker with their devices. MacBooks are going to be lighter, better battery life, and have better displays. Thinkpads are probably the only device that can compete with MacBooks, but there are trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZBar is an open-source library for reading barcodes written in C. One of our clients used it, so we wanted to quickly assess its security. Given the extensive amount of code, manual review was not an option. To fuzz ZBar, it has to be built with sanitizer and fuzzer instrumentation. Building an unfamiliar project can be a time-consuming challenge on its own, and adding instrumentation for fuzzing often makes this task even more difficult. If you’re unfamiliar with the instrumentation flags, our AppSec Testing Handbook has excellent guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzz testing only rose to prominence in ~2012 with the rise of tools like afl-fuzz. ZBar by default scans all code types, which means that an attacker can trigger a bug in any of the scanners. The modern reader firmware tend to have multiple modes and many options. Some modes are as simple as "scan whatever you see out of the many formats you support, and spit out the decoded value of something as USB Serial". Or, worse, "...as USB Keyboard".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazel is a live functional programming environment that is able to typecheck, manipulate, and even run incomplete programs. We model incomplete programs as programs with holes, which stand for parts of the program that are missing. We are developing a more principled approach to working with incomplete programs, rooted in (contextual modal) type theory. Hazel serves as an elegant platform for research on the future of programming (and programming education) We are first implementing these ideas into Hazel, a web-based programming environment for an Elm/ML-like functional programming language designed around typed-hole-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42004133"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is semi-related to one of the killer features of Eclipse that never really made it into any large-scale systems: the ability to run incomplete or broken code. Any underscore or name beginning with an underscore gets an informative error message describing the type of the name, e.g.:  Found hole `_' with type f (Free f b) The difference is that because of the dependently typedness the compiler can sometimes even fill in the code for you based on symbols in scope. This has been verified over time in practice. I believe even 30-50% of a program can work opening up many new possibilities. Could this be used to build an editor for Haskell like the one for Hazel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoë Schlanger: Throw out your black plastic spatula. It’s probably leaching chemicals into your cooking oil. She says black plastic products are likely regularly being made from recycled electronic waste. Flame retardants are typically not bound to the polymers to which they are added. They dislodge easily and make their way into the surrounding environment, she says. The health concerns associated with those chemicals are well established, Schlanger says. But getting rid of black plastic kitchen utensils is a low-stakes move, and worth it, she writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics who specialize in obscure areas love to get their name in the press, and the easiest way to do that is to make vague and irresponsible claims about risks to human health, even if those risks are very, very small. The numerous successful academics at reputable universities that I know (including me) are uniformly mortified when our names are associated with mistaken interpretations. Some of us ( including me) simply stop doing press interviews because it happens so often. If you want to find an incentive to get undeserved attention, I recommend you look at economic incentives within the press itself. Too much time pressure, not enough training, desperate need to gather attention. All the opposite of the academic world. You're one of the good ones! I just wish you were in the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost is a distributed non-profit foundation which gives away all of its intellectual property under a permissive MIT license. The company has no investors and, in fact, no owners of any kind. We currently generate around $7.5M in annual revenue, and have been profitable and sustainable for the past 12 years. The majority of Ghost websites in the world do not use Ghost(Pro) — but the ones that do, directly fund the project for the benefit of everyone. Ghost has a full-time team of 30+ people working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shifted a large 20+ year news publication from Wordpress to ghost about 18 months ago - and opted to use Ghost(Pro) It’s been a dream. The core product for that site is a daily newsletter. On ghost it gets higher opens rates and more engagement than via the previous email backend. Ghost is an extremely easy piece of software to run in a Docker instance on a shoebox somewhere. If you think you’re getting overcharged for it, I’d recommend looking into self-hosting. If anyone has some smaller CMS to recommend (even paid is fine, if the prices is reasonable) that allows for a nice WYSIWYG editor, user accounts and roles, code editor when needed, I'd love to try it. I am trying to start a small blog that will have a handful of writers, so the idea of using some kind of lightweight CMS with edit/post capability is appealing. We don't like the clunky feeling of beefy CMSs, especially when it seems to be built entirely around the analytics, which we do not care all that much about (the blog is intended to be small and hobbiest, we are not interested in making money from it).I found Ghost to be too "on rails" and much more robust than what we need, so it felt like paying for software that sat mostly unused. I have Drupal 11 spun up on VPS but I have not had a moment to sit down and start really digging into it, yet. Thankfully, there is no time-table for this project, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion recalls a messy, largely forgotten episode from the dawn of the quantum era. We have to fight a "war" to find out whether spacetime is quantum? Rilly?? I think it would probably be more effective propaganda to say the "jihad on Christmas" than the "war on Christmas". I think Arabic has too much emphasis on allah related phrases. I don’t think said usage implies anything about their writing abilities. The Browser Wars. Don't always "killer feature", "shot him dead", "waged war on the germs in her refrigerator".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sets, types and type checking. In the process of building a type-checker I have learnt a lot of the details about the theory of types and sets. With all this information I thought I would unpack all the details I have encountered along the way. This first part of this post explains why type-checking exists and what the abstraction of types enables. After some justification for type-theory, we delve deep into what types are and details on the common constructions. And in the finale we will put the definitions to work and explain the implementation of type checking including operations on types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rust we have Option, which is equivalent to T | null. Unions are often made between disjoint types, but not always. The meaning of `T | null` and the meaning of code you write with such a type does depend on what T is at runtime. It's still a validly typed program that obeys a set of rules. There is no tagging in the union type (you don't know if a member comes from the left or right). This is only an issue if you write code expecting the union to work like a tagged union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical AI implies a complete rethink of every individual routine from first principles. We’re heading towards a cultural revolution as much as a technology one. It’s time to find out what value our values really have. Most people go to restaurants because of the social benefits, not the labour savings. The idea of people or groups of people siloing themselves into their ultra-convenient homes and never interact with others is a dystopia and a sure sign of an already broken community. If you aren't cooking and cleaning up after, what's the difference between that and meeting someone at a restaurant? I wonder if you realise how dystopian your life already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, lifetimes must appear in the function declaration. In C#, the compiler simply assumes that the lifetime of the return is the same as the lifetime of the parameter. C# doesn’t share the Rust concept of “borrow checking,” so it wouldn’'t technically be correct to call this ‘borrow Checking’ Rust’s borrow checker is talking about all of the static analysis Rust does to ensure memory safety, for which I think this qualifies. In this document I hope to briefly summarize my understanding of memory safety in C#. I also make direct comparisons between C# constructs and the correspondingRust ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is the language to go when you are doing system programming, but C# is not a bad choice either. With .NET 9 being released in a few weeks we will get NativeAOT (compilation to a native single binary) for x86 (x64 and ARM64 are already available). At work, I'm writing patches for legacy apps and needed to use C++ for most of my tasks. I don't like that it comes with a bunch of limitations[1]. I would focus on writing working code, and try to go AOT close to the end. If it fails and it's not fixable, tough luck, but it works on the standard runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google allocates a specific crawl budget to your indexed site, and the more useless content it has to index and store on its servers, the more it affects your site. The way search engines work means there's typically a 5-7 day gap between updating the robots.txt file and crawlers processing it. Move your favicon to another dir, or root dir, for the time being, and update your HTML to match. Most clients respect the metadata and won't try to fetch the default path until after the  section of the page loads for HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crux is a Precise Verifier for Rust and Other Languages (arxiv.org) The paper is a result of more than work of 4 years, which I did not realize previously.PDFs are a crappy experience on most devices that are not made of paper. If you insist on using the wrong device for viewing them (pro tip: don't use a phone), the experience is superior. There seems to be no market for good digital documents other than digital documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability-generating Functions. The function, and its coefficients, only exists to create a particular structure into which we can store coefficients for latermanipulation. The polynomial and vector are carrying the same information. We don’t evaluate this with anything other than the value we have seen in an earlier sidenote that is not intended for anything meaningful to come out if we replace it with some specific value. We can extract any number in the sequence from this function with some calculus if we want to11 If we. want to extract, say, the third number (in this case 8), we will need to take the second derivative (to. isolate that number as a constant), evaluate the function at zero and then divide by two (to remove excess coefficient that came. from the derivative action.) More generally, the number n is found through the polynomials (0.1-1) and vector (0-1-0) in some sense in the same way as in the previous paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Assembly audio decoders highly optimized for size and performance (github.com/eshaz) The major advantage of a browser based application versus a desktop app is immediate playback of media via hyperlink without the soul crushing limitations Apple imposes on iOS. A media library written for WASM with supplied codecs would not have that limitation, such that you could have an equivalent to VLC directly in a browser supporting any video/audio codec/container supplied in the WASM payload. There exist filters in the browser APIs to adjust play back timing and rate. I have not attempted to modify the media in that way myself but I did see API filters to alter stero panning, tonal quality, wave shape, biquadad, delay, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a global method (in Ruby) in the top-level scope. Ruby’s top- level methods actually are, who they belong to and how they are namespaced. The bare lowercase identifier foo always refers to either a local variable or the method of the current object. All methods defined in a base Object class are public methods that are available on every object for other objects, like #inspect, #to_s, #respond_to?(method), #is_a?(some_class), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a global method in Ruby (zverok.space) The only true 'global' variables, are ones that you can access via Internet Protocol, if you are not doing inter process communication, is going to be englobed by the process object. Even if you write a variable to a file, it's still not 'global', it's encapsulated by the (physical) server object. In other languages, the method definition in the subclass would be irrelevant, calling the global function wouldn’t cause polymorphic method dispatch on the current object. The point the article makes is that the “default object” (self) is not always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory proposes that all complex adaptive systems (CAS) naturally adapt to a state at the “edge of chaos” which is a transition zone between order(stability) and disorder. Theory proposes this is the zone where maximal learning/innovation/creativity in social systems occur. All systems that have accumulated complexity did it in an effort to create resiliency to survive/reproduce/continue to exist. This is innately a method of accumulate self-supervised 'learning', when left to dwell to its own emergent methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack’s engineering team published a flowchart in March 2017 summarizing the logic Slack uses to determine whether to send a notification for a message. Sophie Alpert says the flowchart overcomplicates the situation a lot. Her version of the diagram combines several things that are split out in the original version. The goal of the chart, at least to me, is to make it easy to understand the high-level story of the decision tree, while still staying accurate to small details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is wrong about that Slack flowchart, says CharlesW. CharlesW: Removing nodes by adding a concept of implicit branches via "unless" clauses within a node doesn't necessarily make the system any easier to understand at a glance. People usually don't need to look at the flowchart in its entirety as they can just check the code. Especially as the flow chart could even be out of date, some-level of code could even miss some of the sub-level code. The actual thing will still have the whole complexity. What is reduced is how much complexity we take in when looking at what the thing does, as opposed to getting into the minutiae of every subcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that NY CREATES’s Albany NanoTech Complex, where IBM is a key partner, will house the NSTC EUV Accelerator. Semiconductor chips are the heart of computing that enables the modern world. IBM Research has already shown the first working proof point using High NA EUV lithography. To design and create the next generation of EUV chips, ASML recently started shipping its next generation EUV machines to Albany. The other proposed centers, a design and administration facility and a prototyping and advanced packaging facility, are planned to be announced at a later date. Between the three, they will foster a strong semiconductor research, development, and production pipeline in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is treated like an obsolete dinosaur in tech circles, but they’re so big that I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that they are actually cutting edge in some areas. IBM has developed somewhat of a dark pattern for software sales and they use it to capture their clients. Extricating your organization from the IBM ecosystem is incredibly difficult and often  an uphill battle.IBM has a track record of pursuing highly visible projects, like chip fabs, PowerPC, Watson etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOSBox-X project aims to get Windows XP running instead of Windows 2000. Windows XP isn’t officially supported by the project, so this is very experimental. After multiple attempts I gave up, thinking that Windows XP was impossible to use. After confirming that we want to overwrite the Windows XP installation, Windows XP started the next step of the installation by copying over the temporary installation files. After copying over some atrociously slow files, I stumbled across another issue on the subsequent runs of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smashing the Limits: Installing Windows XP in DOSBox-X (2023) (fabulous.systems) received 170 points. The project was purely a "why not?!" project, it doesn't really make sense and using VMware or true low-level emulation like 86Box is a way better option than using completely unsupported software. A No-CD patch would likely work, but I want to keep things as close to the original as possible. The blue text-mode part of the setup can be launched from DOS 7.1 (the DOS part of Windows 98, with FAT32 support) by copying the i386 directory from the CD to the FAT32-formatted hard drive and running WINNT.EXE from MS-DOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a subculture of people who clean strangers' gravestones, which often involves removing lichen. “It’s not clear to me that the best way to repair the world isn’t sitting and watching lichens grow in a cemetery and telling the world about it,” says Pringle. The reason lichens are studied on gravestones is they have dates on. With those dates you can draw conclusions about growth rates as you have a 'maximum possible age'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cerebras and Groq provide the fastest (by an order of magnitude) inference. This is very useful for certain workflows, which require low-latency feedback: audio chat with LLM, robotics, etc. AMD stuff seems to be the only contender to NVIDIA, at the moment. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how these companies think they are going to do well in this market without more memory. If the costs are so high that they have to subsidize the usage/results, then they are just going to run out of money, fast. Although, for some workloads, fast enough inference is a strict prerequisite and GPUs just don't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTP is a protocol for reliably transferring large immutable files. It is a stateful request/response protocol similar to 9p, but with hash-identified urls similar to magnet links. There are 2 request types: OPEN and READ. The payload of non-error responses to OPEN requests is ignored, and SHOULD be empty. RTP is designed to be as simple as possible without sacrificing our other goals (less complex than http) and performs well under poor network conditions, even when payloads are large (unlike 9p)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41974168"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is already an RTP protocol for UDP media streaming, and that is already frequently confused with RDP. There is also an rtp:// URI scheme in use in various media applications to identity streaming endpoints. If it isn't arbitrary letters, please, if you're describing the protocol, you should start by describing the damn acronym. It's even stranger (to me) that they picked an existing protocol's name, given that they never even define "RTP" in their paper. If the initial response is a redirect, it may imply that redirects are being used as a load distribution mechanism, so again clients can ask again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood is the internal Dropbox load balancing service we deployed in 2020. It is responsible for routing all our internal traffic between servers to balance service load. By leveraging proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers, Robinhood can now more quickly and effectively manage load imbalances. This has not only improved the reliability of our infrastructure, but yielded significant hardware cost savings. Robinhood is compatible with both our Envoy and Envoy xRPC clients2. Reliability has also improved thanks to fewer over-utilized processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and all contributors. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs. Code and models are available at \url{this https URL}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors factorize every weight matrix with an attention mechanism:  weight = attention(token_ query, weight_keys, weight_.values). They query weight_ keys to fetch the weight_values, and mix them to compute each weight on the spot. A recent paper from Nvidia I recommend, which derives a significant speedup by normalising vectors to a hypershpere: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131v1. The plot looks at the processing of a single row of Q (predicting a single token from previous ones) called q. The distance of a blue dot from a corresponding green dot represents how much information from that token gets mixed into the output of the query. The green dots form a hypersphere, a 1D manifold in 2D space. You can see how the query gathers information stored on the surface of the manifold by specifying a region and volume of space specified through direction and magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N Nvidia shares have gained more than 170% this year, while Intel has lost over half its value. The last change to the index came in February, when fellow tech giant Amazon was added. The switch will take place on Nov 8, Sherwin Williams Inc will replace Dow S&amp;P Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov 9. The move reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry. In this article, we highlight the key points that capture the main points: Nvidia to join Dow Jones industrial average, replacing Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel. Hacker News: The Dow is a dinosaur and irrelevant. High dollar value stocks have more weight in the index which doesn't really make sense. The Dow was useful in pre computer times when a reborter could calculate it every few minutes. The s&amp;p500 Is a better indicator but that took hours by hand and so was only done overnight. Now that we have computers and index you want can be done in milliseconds and so the dow needs to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month marks the 21st anniversary of this amazing software. The magic lies in its simplicity and, ironically, its complexity. It’s simple for those who need a straightforward, no-nonsense text editor. It offers complex features for hardcore developers who demand syntax highlighting, multi-document tabbing, and support for dozens of programming languages. Being open-source means that countless developers have contributed to make it better, more secure, and more functional. This little editor has stayed alive and thriving for two decades because of people like us who believed in its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notepad++ is 21 years old. It's the only editor that's still going strong. Notepad++ has been around longer than any other editor or IDE. It lets you work in all three major OS's at the same time, and find it helpful to separate concerns to their respective applications/interfaces. It helps you keep a mental geography of "where things are" and "what tool is used for which purpose", rather than being beholden to a IDE-dictated workflow or tool that's obscured behind specific UI patterns. You run emacs on the emacs side now though, right? So you're probably probably better off that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causal has been acquired by Lucanet. The product is now used by 100s of startups (many YC companies) and we're excited for this next phase of growth. Nothing will change for existing users so you can keep using it for sure. We didn’t have an end goal in mind from the beginning — we had the idea for the product and wanted to see if it had legs as a business, and then grow it and see where we could take it. We’re fortunate to have landed in a middle ground that founders should be aware of earlier on. You don't mean the 97% of businesses who don't end the journey yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's M4 Max chip is the fastest single-core performer in consumer computing. Geekbench numbers give a rough idea of where the performance stands, but what you really need to compare CPUs is a healthy mix of synthetic benchmarks and real-world workloads. Even Apple's M3 SoC gets edged out here in terms of floating point performance, which, given that Apple is on a newer process node (TSMC N3B), is no small feat. Still, there is a sizable deficit in integer performance versus the M3, so while AMD has narrowed the gap with Apple overall, they haven't closed it with the Ryzan AI 300 series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swear words are a constant, but their ability to cause offence is in flux. In the 1600s, today's obscenities were mundane. The most offensive words still used God's name: God's blood, God's wounds, God’s bones, death, flesh, foot, arms, nails, body, sides, guts, tongue, eyes. A statute of 1606 forbade the use of words that ‘iestingly or prophanely’ spoke the name of God in plays. Damn and hell were early modern variations of such blasphemous oaths (bloody came later), as were the euphemistic asseverations, gad, gog and egad. Non-literal uses of these words – which is what tends to be required for swearing – like ‘take the piss’, ‘on the piss' and ‘piss off’ seem to be 20th-century flourishes. For the latter, the diabolical devil rot thee – or epidemiological – ‘a pox on you’ was starting to become obscene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1600s were a watershed for swear words (2022) 'F***' and 'Shit' are just verbal punctuation marks used for emphasis. 'G-- damn it' is a far worse thing to say than 'fucking piece of shit' for example. 'Jesus Christ is not real to use that I have also yet to see anyone use the name of Buddha as a substitute for Mohammed or Mohammed or Jesus' is the worst one I’ll just call “JFC’s full of blasphemy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of technical writing. Embeddings offer the ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales. Here’s an overview of how you use embeddings and how they work. This post is geared towards technical writers who are learning aboutembeddings for the first time. The big service providers have made it easy. Some embedding models are “multimodal”, meaning you can also provide images, videos, and audio as input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embeddings are the only aspect of modern AI I'm excited about because they're the only one that gives more power to humans instead of taking it away. IMO, the biggest improvement in computer usability in my lifetime was the introduction of fast and ubiquitous local search. I've been experimenting with using embeddings for finding the relevant git commits, as I often don't know or remember the exact word that was used. Embeddings have the potential to solve the biggest weakness of search by giving us fuzzy search that's actually useful. Whether current AI tools are replacing or amplifying your intelligence, is entirely down to how you use them.&lt;/p&gt;

There is far far far more to be had for the patent royalties from treatments. So much more money to be made from treatment than from research. And there is so much money tobe had from beating a competitor with a better treatment than there is to have an equivalent treatment. Taking a cynical profit-only driven view of the world would optimize for better cancer care. There are promising research directions, which are grossly underexplored, because there is a low chance it might lead to a positive result. The majority of money is being spent on highly predictable and predictable research, which can almost always result in a patent patent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Gardner’s Mathematical Games column in Scientific American fascinated and mystified readers for decades. Gardner had no formal mathematical training, and his path to science and math writing was a strange one. Gardner “didn’t have the high profile of his contemporary Richard Feynman or his friend Isaac Asimov,” says Colm Mulcahy, a professor emeritus of mathematics at Spelman College. “But his legacy might yet exceed theirs,’” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dual Nature of Events in Event-Driven Architecture by Lutz Hühnken is published on 31 October 2024. In an event-driven architecture, microservices collaborate by emitting and subscribing to events. Events are usually both trigger and carrier of data - varying in the amount of data included. There is no consensus on how much data should usually be included in an event - it’s not even clear what to call the data-heavy events on the right end of the spectrum. This article only talks about events that are “published” from one domain for others to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The triggering of the action is a direct consequence of the information an event contains. Whether or not an action is triggered should not be the responsibility of the event. Each consumer can perform their own targeted lookups as needed. Distributed locks and transactions are hell. There should be some law that says strictly serialized process should never be broken into discreet services. This is the entire problem, your example is very naive. If you take a distributed lock and save it, you still have the same issue. What I wrote is still the same, but even that won't save you. I've been working on this for a couple of years now and getting close to something really interesting ... but not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baked potatoes are baked skin-on whole in the oven. Roast potatoes are cut up, tossed in oil, salt, and sometimes other herbs, and baked that way. "Bake" and "roast" are distinct culinary jargon terms. To properly do this potato, stab with the potato with the reason it produces a potato, not a fork. To cook potatoes then cook them directly on the oven rack (or in a barbecue) until it gives a fair bit of give.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe fast transformer inference is the missing link to making generative video a reality. When Etched's transformer ASIC, Sohu, is released, we can run models like Oasis in 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oasis: A Universe in a Transformer (oasis-model.github.io) is an AI-powered game-making tool. The tool is only trained on Minecraft, but could be used to create other games. It's not clear how it would be used for game design, but it could be a way for game designers to rapidly prototype a game. Oasis v1 is a first POC. Wait just a bit more for v2 ;) The tool has been posted on Hacker News. For more information, visit the Oasis website or follow us on Twitter at @HackerNews or on Facebook at Hacker News #Oasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 34x34x34 cube has become the highest-order NxNxN Rubik's Cube, announced Matt Bahner in a YouTube video. It took about 1 year, and 1000 work hours to make the cube. The previous record, the 33x33 cube by Greg's Puzzles was also available for sale in 2017 for $15.200. To put this intor perspective, the mass-produced 17x17x17 by Yuxin costs roughly $750. The cube would require 6936 stickers, thankfully, it comes in a stickerless version, with colored plastic pieces. The 2x2, 4x4 and 5x5 are invented one year after the original 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube was released in 1980. The V-Cube 6 was the first mass- produced 6x6x6 big cube, introducing a new level of complexity and challenge to cubing enthusiasts. The 7x7x7 Cube reveals the inherent geometry in constructing a fully proportional cube. To overcome this limitation, inventors face two options: either abandon the cubic shape and make it pillowed with the V-Cubes, or they must accept that the outer layers will be non-proportional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for making enormous cubes like the 34x34x34 is just the engineering challenge, and breaking records. Solving a 5x5x5 for the first time took just a couple of hours, there wasn't much new to learn. The 7x7x7 is the biggest cube used in official competitions, for a good reason. There is a very easy-to-remember algorithm that can be trivially executed by humans given here in a Mathologer video, with a time-code link to jump straight to it: https://youtu.be/MbonokcLbNo?si=ey8bv4T9KbDxgB7N&amp;t=650.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bourne shell (and by extension, bash and POSIX's sh) have syntax inspired by Algol 68 (source [0]), which explains some of the funkyness. One thing I've been doing recently is writing scripts in rc, the default shell for plan9. Versions linked against readline have file-based completion, but it's otherwise not quite robust enough for me to switch away from fish as my default. I encourage people to giverc and awk a shot, they're both small and learnable in an afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature is modelled based on how much power is put through it. Power, not temperature is measured. Apple isn't the first to use advanced limiters to get the most of loudspeakers, if I remember, this trick is what allowed the Phantom to make the most noise. If Apple gets around to supporting HDR on machines equipped with FALD mini-LED backlights (or XDR, as Apple calls it) then Asahi will need to replicate it. The Asahi devs have had to painstakingly reverse engineer and reimplement the safety DSP that macOS uses on each device, and add some safety margin. If they get it wrong they could literally destroy the speakers (and IIRC at least one of their own MacBooks did have its speakers sacrificed along the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadwell’s limited desktop release is particularly interesting because it came with 128 MB of eDRAM based L4 cache. EDRAM is quite a troublesome technology to work with if you want high performance at low power. Broadwell implemented its L4 Cache on a separate 77mm2 die, creating a chiplet configuration. This cache die was codenamed “Crystal Well”, and was fabricated using the older 22nm process. For starters, Crystal Well has a massive 128 banks compared to eight or even DDR5’S. Dividing the DRAM array banks into banks gets around the destructive read+write problem because each bank happens independently for each bank count. Higher bank count decreases the chance of an incoming access clashing with an outgoing access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is the same - putting a huge amount of cache on chip - but it's a very different solution. Broadwell implemented its L4 cache on a separate 77mm2 die, creating a chiplet configuration. This cache die was codenamed “Crystal Well’, and was fabricated using the older 22nm process. A lot of interesting details in article about how widely different this dram is, made to go fast fast fast. Fun read. I'd really wanted a system with Crystal Well, seemed so cool. But general adoption in the PC market was - I feel - quite poor.&lt;/p&gt;

A prime number is any natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and the number itself, without leaving a remainder. The regular expression ^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$ can filter outany prime numbers. A regular expression matches the position right after the last character in the string that matches the first character, except for characters that do not break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethernet has been the mainstay of much of the networking environment for almost 50 years. Aggregate Switching capacity has increased by a factor of 16 in the past decade. The foundation of today's production Ethernet networks lies in 100Gbps lanes. When paired up they provider a 200Gbps service, and in groups of four they provide today's 400Gbs Ethernet service. The IEEE's P802.3dj work is to define a standard specification for a base capacity of a 200 Gbps Ethernet lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethernet out here quietly leveling up to 800GbE like it’s no big deal… meanwhile I’m just trying to get my WiFi to reach the kitchen. The name NDP looks little bit confusing. If you have coax, MoCA is a stellar option. I put MoCA and a TP-LINK Omada setup (unified control of all AP's) in my in-laws' house a couple of years ago. They went from almost-undetectable WiFi in most places to a solid signal throughout the entire house. They love it. They even asked why their ISP didn't do it. My MIL even said oh, we'll pay for the gear, you didn't need to spend that much. No, you won't, it's a gift from me (because it means that my wife and I won't have to worry about nonexistent WiFi when we're at your house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian, the $40 million superyacht of the British tech mogul Michael Lynch, dropped anchor off Sicily. A New York Times investigation discovered that the Bayesian’s most striking feature — its extra-tall mast and the engineering to accommodate it — made the yacht vulnerable to capsizing. All the other boats in the same series, from the same Italian manufacturer, had two masts instead of one. Technical documents obtained by The Times and computer models show the yacht was susceptible to being knocked over in a storm and would sink quickly. Fifteen survivors, bloodied and broken, made it to a life raft. But seven died as theBayesian plunged to the bottom, where divers have searched for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sank the Bayesian superyacht in Italy? (nytimes.com) The company speculated that the crew did not close a watertight door between this hatch and the engine room. But witnesses, an Italian official familiar with the investigation and the underwater video challenged the company’s versions of events. The attitude of "we are perfect, somebody else's fault" stinks, even if they are not. Even if after all the investigations it turns out the manufacturer were without blame (which usually is not the case) their attitude doesn't reflect well on them. Do you want to buy your yacth from someone who will blame everyone but themselves when things go wrong? I would rather buy a yacht fromSomeone who will incorporate all the learnings into their new designs to make them as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important function of in-person conferences is meeting people. The speakers put time into preparing their talks knowing that there will be an audience to watch it. The combination of pre-recorded talks, asynchronous chat, and no travel requirements leads to a much smaller investment of time and effort. The most experienced and knowledgable experts tend to also be the busiest. Transferring hard-won wisdom to the next generation takes a huge amount of work which few people find the time for.&lt;/p&gt;

(scattered-thoughts.net) 137 points by jamii 2 days ago  | hide | past | favorite | 103 comments   “I have been speaking at about 50 conferences over the years and I refuse to do online ones. Why?- Conferences are usually not paid, except expenses. In person conferences allow you to meet and network with other speakers. Online conferences do not (unless you count "come to our discord" as networking, I don't)- The value I get from conferences is also interacting with the public and listening to them, outside of the talks. I also don't really get any of the promotion value for my company, which obviously I represent. I understand they are cheaper to organize but the value is simply not there at all, so I will not speak at them, attend them, or sponsor them. This thread is a Gell-annnesia generator. Everyone says online conferences are stupid and then doesn't see how absurd they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is the world's most popular and powerful declarative programming paradigm. It's being used for native apps, VR, 3d, CAD and electronics. It has issues, but being "built for DOM/web" is not one of them. A simple example of where it is better than most tools is you can simply import a re-usable "ranger-style" file browsing component, and adapt it for things like exploring a database, a spreadsheet, or an API spec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIL: C Intermediate Language is a new programming language. CIL was first published in 2001, and started in 2000. There is another CIL too: SELinux CIL, Common Intermediate Language. There are a finite number of names, and an even smaller number of good names. This is a fork of an earlier project and the name comes from that doesn't stop it! This would be very useful for adding simple extensions to the language. I tried to do this but couldn't figure out how to make LLVM do it.&lt;/p&gt;

The syntax highlight function only needs to consider a single character in in a string to get a collision free lookup. The new llama file chatbot has made llama so pleasant to use that it's rare that I feel tempted to use it to talk about the kinds of lexical programming languages I'm surprised that C doesn't support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird Lexical Syntax | Hacker News. The post is about why the like trigraphs was precisely why the user was asked to use them. The question was: Did you choose the legacy C trigraph's over || for aesthetic purposes? The answer is 'yes,' but that doesn't mean that the question doesn't need to be asked, perhaps perhaps that it doesn't make sense. The answer to the question is: Yes, I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hyundai Kona Electric powertrain is absurdly complicated. To re-purpose the Kona's powertrain into an EV conversion, we need to find the simplest subset of modules that can work together. The Bench Kona holds modules taken from the engine bay and the interior of the car, plus large segments of the original wiring (now unwrapped, cut, spliced, and converted into a tangled mess) The rough plan has been:Wire together modules on the bench until the motor turns, and the traction battery can be charged. The first module to be eliminated was the Integrated Gateway and Power Module (IGPM), which was damaged by forward probing. It's important to note that absolutely none of the techniques used to wire up the bench Kona translate over to a real moving vehicle. This is strictly for reverse engineering purposes. One, when one of its connectors was damaged, may accidentally apply the Law of Leaky Abstractions to cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more software bleeds into electro-mechanical systems, the less repairable, versatile and hackable they become. It's not just about proprietary software that has reached its end of support, given enough time almost any source code tree will bitrot past the point where rebuilding it will require a major overhaul. If you want to fix or customize a physical artifact like a coffee machine, you usually don't go inside the factory to change the blueprints and manufacture a new one. You just modify the one you have with standardized tools. It also doesn't matter how old the artifact is, even if it's decades out of production it can still usually be disassembled and put back together as if it was fresh out of the assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DownloadManager class has ignored every SSL certificate validation error that has ever happened, on every platform, for 14 years and 6 months since April 6 2010 with commit 9824d86. The default behaviour changed to verifying on October 12 2024 with commit 3d9e971. The first patched release is version 5.0.1, released 2 days ago. This issue has now been assigned to CVE-2024-51774. These issues require MITM access, or DNS spoofing to exploit. The usages of DownloadManager across the program are extensive, and affect searches, .torrent downloads, RSS feeds, favicon downloads and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In qBittorrent, the DownloadManager class has ignored every SSL certificate validation error that has ever happened, on every platform, for 14 years and 6 months since April 6 2010 with commit 9824d86. The author of the PR[0] that fixed this also came to this conclusion:&gt; I presume that it was a quick'n'dirty way to get SSL going which persisted to this day. The idea behind the function is that you provide it a small whitelist of errors you wish to ignore, for example in a Dev build you may well want to ignore self-signed errors for your Dev environment. The trouble is, you can call it with no arguments and this means you will ignore every error. It's very easy for us to say we would then have immediately amended it in the next version. Especially in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signal: Online MIDI Editor ( GitHub) is a free, open-source MIDI editor. The name is a problem as it makes it really hard to find anything about it. There is already well-known software named Signal. People are free to use the name they want, whether it is the NSA or an individual, it doesn't matter. The project looks interesting, but would be better if there was at least a screenshot in that Readme. The demo asked for MIDI permission, but didn't accept input from my MIDI keyboard until I realised you have to enable it in settings. There's enough lag in the system that most of my notes end up a bit delayed, and the snap-to-grid doesn't seem to be working.&lt;/p&gt;

Each featured item links directly to their original project websites, where you’ll find everything needed to make them. I hope this can serve as a source of inspiration for your next project. I’m looking forward to seeing what you come up with in the next few months. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make It Yourself (makeityourself.org) is a project by n-o-d-e[1], they make blog posts and videos about diy tech/mods. This specific project is described in [2] and is not mentioned on the website. They also have techno-optimistic YouTube channels that I love. There haven't been any new videos for a while, but some of the older ones are worth watching:https://www.youtube.com/@NODEtv/videos. I find myself surprisingly annoyed at choice of PDF as the format. It's the worst of both traditional and web publication modes; low accessibility AND low portability. I'd prefer a static PDF I can pinch, zoom, and move about on my own than some crappy, overwrought, "mobile" website that forces me to jump around to different parts of the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking the T2S+ Out of Fear: Get Lock-In Thermography for Free (dmytroengineering.com) Luc: I think whatever fear he decompiled this out of was justified. The author notes only skimming the parts he found where the requested permissions were used, given that the experience of the author was not focused in either Android nor Java. There is absolutely NO reason for this app to need MDM_APP_MGMT. This is capability for remote administration of the device, including ability to install additional apps (which is likely where this vector would expand exploitation). We don't see where that permission is used from the few screenshots of non-thermo sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpawELO is a matchmaking system for LAN parties. It was created by Spawek and his friends to make LAN parties better. The system is based on the Dota 2 match-making system. It uses a single-player choice as each leader’s final pick. The team selection process is similar to picking football teams in school. It is also based on a single player choice as the final pick, which balances the advantage of picking first. It can be used to pick teams for Dota 2 matches, as well as other games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma Postgres is a managed Postgres service that gives developers an always-on database with pay-as-you-go pricing. It's like a serverless database — but without cold starts and a generous free tier. To build a service with these capabilities, we've designed a unique architecture using bare metal machines, a revolutionary millisecond cloud stack, and unikernels running as ultra-lightweight microVMs. Prisma Postgres comes with connection pooling, caching, real-time subscriptions, and query optimization recommendations out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma Postgres – Runs on bare metal and unikernels (prisma.io) The pricing you are citing is for Accelerate, which does advanced connection pooling and query caching across 300 POPs globally. In EA (early access), there's no additional cost of Prisma Postgres, you're effectively getting a free Postgres db. The pricing of these serverless offerings is always completely out of this world. My $5 VPS can handle more queries in an hour. Is it truly impossible to serve this stuff somewhere closer to cost? If this is close to cost, is this truly as efficient as it gets? You'll save time on both latency and compute that way, for example, running on a single internal Accelerate project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual, practical use of FEM has been stagnate for quite some time. Every advanced/"next generation" thing the article touts has fallen flat on its face when applied to real problems. FDM is abysmal on most real-world problems - e.g. it might give good results on a cylinder in simple tension, but fails horribly when adding bending. There's still nothing better, but looking back I'm pretty surprised I'm still basically doing things the same way I was as an Engineer 1. I've been on countless development projects that seem promising but just won't validate in the real world. I kind of thought Neural Operators were slotting into the some problem domains where FEM is used (based on recent work in weather modelling, cloth modelling, etc) and thought there was some sort of F EM -&gt; NO lineage. Did I completely misunderstand that whole thing?&lt;/p&gt;

It is enabled on 50% of Shopify's production servers. The impact on capacity, however, is less significant than we had hoped for. The next step is to look at the minor collections at the bottom of the page. The full article can be read in its entirety on the Ruby website. It can also be downloaded from the Ruby site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Out of Band Garbage Collection (railsatscale.com) is the next generation of Ruby-on-Rails' garbage collection system. The new system will use garbage collection to eliminate the need for a garbage collection process. It will use a new type of garbage collection called out-of-band garbage collection (OGC) to make it easier for applications to use GC. It is the first time in the history of the web that a language has been used to replace GC with out of band garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E-Reader is a Game Boy Advance peripheral that Nintendo released in 2002. By scanning cards that have a dot code strip on them, you can load mini games, extra levels, animations and more. I managed to fit it onto a single card, and it's a pretty full featured version of the game. I've always really liked the E- Reader and was sad it didn't do too well in America. So I thought maybe I'd take a stab at making games for it myself. And here is the resultSolitaire in its card fromIf you would like to try it, you could get a card at retrodotcards.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cramming Solitaire onto a Nintendo E-Reader card (mattgreer.dev) scored 106 points. The computer could do it in 129 moves. The shuffling is random, but only winnable decks are generated (by default). The computer algorithm/solver is described here: https://FreeSolitaire.win/strategy. The game was significantly easier than other 1-card draw implementations I've played. It's easy because you're drawing one card at a time, not 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct sockets will have their uses for compatibility with existing applications, but it's possible to do almost any kind of networking you want on the web if you control both sides of the connection. This slowly alters the essence of The Internet, due to the permissionless nature of running any self-organising system like Bittorrent and Bitcoin. This is NOT in Android, just isolated Web Apps at this stage[0]. The "direct socket access" creep moves forward again. First, IoT without any security standards. Now Web Apps. With direct socket access to TCP/UDP you can build anything! You loose the constraint of JS servers, costly WebRTC server hosting and lack of feature in WebR TC DataChannel. This might bring back the dreams of Peer2Peer... In our lab we bought 40+ SIM cards for the big EU 4G/5G networks and got the puncturing-grade NAT blends working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep regularity is a stronger predictor of mortality than sleep duration (2023) Study looked at one week of sleep data and then check mortality records about 10 to 15 years later. I'd really like to see the same study with longer term sleep data. There's a health research programme currently underway in the UK that’s looking to recruit up to 5 million people. I believe they’re currently at around the 1 million mark. Any statistics buffs here: Is 500krits for a week as good as the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eponymous blockbuster movie introduced these beings to a wide audience. Hollywood gremlins are particularly interested in meddling with technological devices to cause serious accidents. The term has been traced back to 1920s Royal Naval Air Force slang, but it was during World War II, a time of rapid technological advances, that the lore evolved. Gremlins became full-fledged celebrities, characterized as pesky critters who crawled into plane machinery and destroyed it. For average aviators, there was every reason to fear sudden and unexpected malfunctions. In 1944, a graduate student at New York University, theorized that g Remlins offered an increasingly stressed, greener coping mechanism to pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RingGesture: A Ring-Based Mid-Air Gesture Typing System Powered by a Deep-Learning Word Prediction Framework, by Junxiao Shen and 4 other authors. This method offers an intuitive experience similar to raycast-based mid-air gesture typing found in VR headsets. It achieves an average text entry speed of 27.3 words per minute (WPM) and a peak performance of 47.9 WPM. We highlight the superior performance of the Score Fusion framework, which offers a 28.2% improvement in uncorrected Character Error Rate over a conventional word prediction framework, Naive Correction. We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and all contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RingGesture is a ring-based mid-air gesture typing system. The process begins when the user articulates their wrist, positioning the cursor over the initial letter of the desired word. It's just a virtual keyboard in VR/AR with phone-type word completion. With text-to-speech and the gesture and movement recognition abilities described in this article, is typing really input method we should be optimizing? It's a misconception that QWERTY was designed to slow down typing. It was designed in the 1870s in part to make it hard to type so fast that typewriter keys would jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain's postwar sugar craze confirms harms of sweet diets in early life. US sugar consumption declined from 2000-2020 to 1970s levels, while its T2D prevalence only increased. tribes of hunter-gatherers in Africa get 15-80% of their daily calories from honey during certain seasons; why aren't they obese and diabetic? The US government just lumps all forms of sugar together and labels it all genetically as sugar…ignores there are different form of sugar, each processed by our bodies differently and having different metabolic impacts and harms. If anything, high-fat, low-carb diets seem to worsen actual insulin sensitivity, which just masks carbohydrate restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katsushika Hokusai’s wood block print of a gigantic wave frothing before Mount Fuji, which he made in his seventies, is so beloved and influential that the scholar Christine Guth has devoted a whole book to it. Less attention has been paid to the beguiling illustrations he crafted for the series Hyaku Monogatari [One Hundred Ghost Stories] (ca. 1830) The series is fruit of the tradition Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai [A Gathering of One Hundred Supernatural Tales], where Japanese friends would meet to share fantastically frightening tales from folklore and their own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions and accents are like universal cues that connect us, allowing emotions to cross cultural boundaries. Even instinctual ways of communicating carry subtle accents influenced by culture, social background, and the context around us. As a stranger in a strange land (an American living in Australia), I am both confronted and fascinated by these identities, norms, and expectations every day. Here’s what the research suggests about how we share emotions and why that sharing is both universal and uniquely shaped by where we come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Language of Faces is a post on Hacker News. The post explores how we often interpret facial expressions as a kind of language, shaped by culture and context. It's saying that while we might associate certain expressions with emotions, those associations aren’t universal—they’re flexible, just like Lisa Feldman-Barrett describes. Their insights are especially valuable for fields like AI, where understanding these nuances could help build technology that better respects cultural differences in expression. The author of the post, domofutu.substack.com, says the post is based on a series of claims that have been disproven but refuse to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Serious Man by Steven Shapin is published by The Journal of the History of Ideas (JHI) Shapin writes that Bruno Latour was from a wine-growing family; he was from Burgundy; and he was Catholic. Bruno professed little interest in either wine or commercial things. Pasteurization killed the microbes, but the development of the wines in barrel was a purely physical process, to do with oxygenation and internal chemical reactions. Wine was either a cultural convention or an error of speech to say that wine was one sort of voice of tradition. Modernity pulled these things apart, rather than point out that they were never apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41998337"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Serious Man: On Bruno Latour (jhiblog.org) by Stephen Shapin (another famous figure in the history of science / STS) is mostly about Latour’s Catholicism. Much of his writing resists analysis while encouraging repetition and undeformed travel. He was famous for Life, of course, but he did the same sort of anthropological analysis of French courts too. What makes him a little bit easier to grok is that he refused to deny there was a reality other than the socially constructed ones we make/negotiate. So you have to study it very carefully in particular contexts and study it in order to understand what's happening in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities are like good ideas - you’re rarely the first one dealing with it. Some vulnerabilities are almost classic, so I’ll proudly present: 7 old but surprisingly useful bugs that might also affect YOUR device. None of these exploits are rocket science. This is kind of the “low tech’ hacking approach - no fancy oscilloscopes required, no DPA involved, no FIB to rent. There’s not even code to disassemble! The first vulnerability is a classic oversight. It applies to many devices that are accepting a mass-storage device (for example USB or micro-SD) and are somehow exposing the contents of this to the outside world. This includes WLAN/3G access points with a “file share” ability, NAS and a lot of special purpose devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Just plug in the USB-C cable, and you have a virtual 60" screen in front of you which works perfectly for Netflix, etc. Counterpoints: I can’t get them setup to program on well tho. Honestly xreal’s marketing is generous at best. I am looking to the Viture and others, but so far they are more expensive and not better according to the reviews I have seen. I only care about code and the incidental movie (it's great to put noise cancelling headphone, the protection cap (blocking all light) and just sit in the cinema alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touchscreens just stop registering your touch when you get old. The older you get the less moisture there's in your skin, which at some point makes touch screens ignore you. Licking or wetting your fingers for this purpose has been a standard practice across the globe. It was very much a thing in the US and Europe too until a few decades back. There were office gadgets made for this, basically a base holding a small sponge, that you would add water to, and use it to wet your fingers. They're still very much sold:https://www.amazon.com/money-counting-sponge/s?k=money+count...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's fifth-generation Jupiter data center network architecture now scales to 13 Petabits/sec of bisectional bandwidth. To put this data rate in perspective, this network could support a video call (@1.5 Mb/s) for all 8 billion people on Earth! The foundation of our network is the reliability for all other compute services, from storage to AI. We rigorously monitor every bad minute across hundreds of clusters and millions of ports across our global network. Our progress on Jupiter networks, such as our software-house-house networks, deliver a factor of 50x more reliability than prior versions of our data center networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's DC networking is interesting because of how deeply integrated it is into the entire software stack. This is so Borg instances can talk to each other within the same service at high throughput and low latency. AFAICT that's just the NIC they're plugging into Jupiter. That's probably what enables (or will enable) 100Gbps connections between servers. It doesn't sound like Google is abandoning their custom TPU silicon (ie it talks about the upcoming A3 Ultra and Trillium). This is because they didn't want to buy into Nvidias proprietary Infiniband stack for GPU-GPU networking, and instead wanted to make it work on top of their ethernet (but still pretty proprietary) stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get Me Out Of Data Hell is a new book about the horrors of working in an enterprise data warehouse. The book is the result of the author's time working in a data warehouse in Melbourne, Australia. The author has seen enough workplaces to know that this is what most cultures degenerate into. The best places to work are places where you can get at least some of the things that a person needs to do to get a good job. The median companies (some people call "good" companies) lack the outright bullying but still consist of people trying to convince themselves that it's fine to feel disempowered or subservient all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get me out from data hell. The whole industry is a scam. There's like a 0% success rate for new data projects. Every data team is a cost-centre that unscrupulous managers use to launch their careers by saying they're big on AI. I don't think a lot of orgs which use data as core-infra could modernize, the industry is just so broken at this point. I was in Melbourne in 2012.. with idea to relocate wholesale, 2nd time. Worked 2 months at some "startup", that fired me when i finished the task given. Seems it was cheaper to hire "permanent" then fire, rather than take someone on 2 months contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is known as bang-bang control, a very basic form of negative feedback. The vessel can only rise to above 100C once all the water has changed phase (boiled) The same trick is used in older car model turn signal lights, to produce the periodic on/off switching. It was Sony who actually tried to build the first rice cooker, but they failed so badly that they gave up and pivoted to radios [0]: http://www.onefromnippon.com/rice-cookers/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-memory algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) have achieved great success for fast high-recall search, but are extremely expensive when handling very large scale database. In this paper, we present a simple but efficient memory-disk hybrid indexing and search system, named SPANN, that follows the inverted index methodology. We guarantee both disk-access efficiency (low latency) and high recall by effectively reducing the disk- access number and retrieving high-quality posting lists. Experiment results demonstrate that SPANN is 2$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art ANNS solution to reach the same recall quality $90\%$ with same memory cost in three billion-scale datasets. It can reach $90/%$ recall@1 and recall@10 in just around one millisecond with 32GB memory cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolog at its core is SLD Resolution (a form of search) over Horn Clauses (first order logic) Queries posted to the runtime are attempts to find a set of values which will satisfy (cause to be true) the query. The guarantees you get with using the 'pure' core of Prolog do open up some really interesting avenues though, for example Scryer's debugging library is quite neat in affording _semantic_ debugging: https://www.scryer.pl/ debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security flaws found in all Nvidia GeForce GPUs. Update drivers ASAP! If you have an Nvidia GeForce graphics card, you need to download the latest driver updates now. A total of eight vulnerabilities are listed, all of them with a “High” severity rating. According to Nvidia, it’s possible to gain access to the entire system by exploiting one of the vulnerabilities. With this kind of access, hackers can not only execute malicious code but also read and steal personal data. The vulnerabilities affect Nvidia RTX, Quadro, NVS, and Tesla, both under Windows and under Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. If you have a single user machine and aren't already owned then this is a non-issue and the verbiage and article are not warranted. Users with some untrusted malware on their system virtualization hosts (which could escalate) are the people that actually need to update. If it would be exploitable from the browser, it wouldbe huge. If I'm reading the bulletin right, then all the issues can only be exploited from code already running on your machine. It could be running multiplayer video games or there will be code on your system that interacts with your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ractor is a Rust language extension that allows you to write your own Rust applications. It is built on top of the Tokio Rust programming language. Ractor can be used to run a stateful sample or to send and receive messages. It can also be used as a way to test your code. The following is a quickstart of how to use Ractor in Rust. The main points of the quickstart are to define the state of the actor and the message type of the message sent to it. The quickstart is also a good place to clarify some of the notations in Erlang’s naming scheme, such as “cast” and “call”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has adequate concurrency tooling to make ad hoc actor designs roughly on par with more developed ones for many tasks, but supervision is both highly valuable and non-trivial. A reusable Fn that takes some kind of supervisor context and builds a set of children, potentially recursively building the supervision tree beneath, tends to be the best design for typed channels. It forces one_for_all however as it's a monolithic restart function. Man, these actor frameworks just make me appreciate how cool Erlang is. That's the real superpower of OTP, especially over Rust. And being able to inspect / debug / modify a live system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating block devices on your computer backed by Redstone Memory (github.com/williambl) Manual error correction in Minecraft the equivalent of going at one's hard drive with a magnetized needle. The Enderman can just steal your read (head)block. If the space is only two blocks tall, then corruption is prevented. If you’re willing to build a full ARM emulator with VGA and IO in redstone, you can start writing kernel modules to support the various redstone IO devices. Once that’s all hooked up, you try compiling Java. It’d probably be terribly slow though, unless you made a redstone optimized CPU. Then you would need to get Linux building on that.&lt;/p&gt;

The first delete operation is for data pruning, and I don’t want these deletions to be reflected in the replicated database’s read operations. The second delete operation, for rollback purposes, which alters the data state, should indeed be replicated to maintain consistency. Is there a way to distinguish between these two delete operations so that only the rollback deletions are replicated? And would your tool support this kind of use case?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ToolGit is a collection of scripts that extend Git with various sub-commands. Ahmetsait: These should be aliases in your git config. I get coming up with a solution to a problem, and finding it neat locally. But before posting to HN, one might realize that these solutions that git provides existing tools for is better than maintaining this. Some of these can indeed be an alias, others.. not so much. `git-root` for example is more-or-less a one-liner, meanwhile ` git-mode-restore` is a ~840 loc python script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to write this for a while but it turned into a much longer write up than I was expecting so it’s being broken into multiple parts. Martyn at 38 North did a great write up on the app earlier this year but I wanted to dive into it more. If you’re not familiar with the app you can read about it here: https://www.38north.org/2024/01/a-close-up-look-at-north-koreas-digital-map-app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An older version of the app was previously detailed by Alek Sigley, an Australian student who previously lived in Pyongyang while studying at Kim Il Sung University. The app has options to share via Bluetooth and 3G and a third unknown option that lets you enter an address. There are no suspicious blanks in the map or missing buildings. The North Korean leadership don't like to be reminded of the unfinished Ryugyong Hotel[1], or more prosaically there may be missing military sites and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;summarize this text in one concise paragraph that capture the main points. Colorado scrambles to change voting-system passwords after accidental leak - Ars Technica. Colorado votes to change its voting- system passwords after an accidental leak. The vote will take place on November 4, 2014, at 8 p.m. (P.M. ET) The vote is a non-binding, open-ended ballot that will be administered by the Colorado Board of Canvassers. The board will vote on whether or not to change the passwords, and the vote will be open to the public. The state will then vote on the new passwords, which will be submitted to the board by the end of the month. The new passwords will take effect on November 5, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; password list has been public for a long time, and is easy to access: hidden excel column on a public spreadsheet. BIOS access means the intruder can change boot devices, boot their own OS, infect the BIOS with a virus and compromise the vote host OS. Keycard security isn't tight security. Any amature physical penetration tester would just use a primitive attack on the door to get around it. If it's all paper where does the computer fit in? All of this is honest curiosity, I'm not sure how the voting system works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gptel is a simple LLM client for Emacs. It leverages Magit's interface. It's built-in to an LLM buffer so that code generated by the LLM can be evaluated right away in place. It works with llamafile, gemma 27b, and a number of other tools. It can also be used to create a transient for your own work tasks. It is on par with magit and undo-tree in being so damn useful and reliable that they are keeping me from ditching emacs, even though I want to. I've only recently started dabbing into AI-assisted programming, and I think this integration into Emacs is really smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe add [180MB] to the title, similar to how videos or pdfs are tagged? It starts loading that immediately when you open the page, which would be 18% of my data bundle if I had been on mobile. My M1 MacBook with 16 gigabytes of RAM is struggling to load/display the data though. GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month. If your site exceeds these usage quotas, we may not be able to serve your site, or you may receive a polite email from GitHub Support suggesting strategies for reducing your site's impact on our servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Submerged Nabataean Temple in Puteoli at Pozzuoli, Italy is one of the world's most famous ancient ruins. The temple was submerged by water during a storm in the middle of the 20th century. It is located near the town of Pisa, Italy, but is also in Naples, Italy. It was built by the Nabataeans, who lived during the reign of Augustus and Trajan in the 4th century BC. The site is now owned by the National Museum of Natural History of Italy, which is located in the city of Putesi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year saw a lot of research consolidation, with continued progress along well-established lines. New techniques have opened up avenues of understanding kinship from ancient populations and the links between people and artifacts. Balancing selection can be a result of overdominance, in which heterozygotes have better survival or reproduction. Or it can result from frequency dependence, where the relative fitness of an allele declines when the allele becomes very common, or balancing selection can happen when an allele has varied fitnesses in different times and places. Many fascinating questions about ancient people involve their social dynamics and kinship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top discoveries about ancient people from DNA in 2023. Denisovan missense variants had a stronger response than their human orthologs. Neandertals, on the other hand, had a much lower response. It’s impressive how ancient DNA maps our origins though it feels like piecing together a story with missing chapters.Consider applying for YC's W25 batch! Applications are open till Nov 12.

&lt;p&gt;Redis lets you do stuff in the application that you just can't do with Postgres. Postgres kicks ass obviously but it is not running in memory on the same machine as the application. Redis can cluster alongside your backend cluster, so you'll have the advantage that sometimes the data will be local. Most languages are less memory efficient than redis, even in a separate process, and I don’t want to reimplement half of its features. You can do a mutex in like 10 bytes, how could redis be more memory efficient? I've not yet ran out of memory because of program variables and speed shouldn't be an argument for low memory footprint when it's already at best 1/10 of its performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; venvstacks is a Python utility for creating an integrated set of independently downloadable Python application environments. It uses Python's sitecustomize.py environment setup feature to chain together three layers of Python virtual environments. The layers are archived and published separately, but their dependency locking is integrated. It allows the application layers to share dependencies installed in the framework layers, and the framework layer to sharedependencies in the runtime layers. It enabled us to ship our MLX engine, a Python application, within LM Studio without requiring the end user to install any Python depedencies. It is live on PyPi: $ pip install --user venv stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venvstacks allows you to package Python applications and all their dependencies into a portable, deterministic format, without needing to include copies of these large Python frameworks in every application archive. The hard part is figuring out what "merge" means for your use case. The entire reason that venv exists is because python's library system is nothing but dependency spaghetti: whatever is needed by one project conflicts with whatever is needs by another. What is needed is a "current environment" that is used to isolate groups of dependencies, but not just about conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility of experimental results is a cornerstone of the scientific method. In open source, the goal is to lower the barrier for others to replicate and use your software. The technical challenges of getting someone else’s software to work for us does not get any easier. Complexity that a common way to manage complexity is to punt it to someone else. The Linux Foundation has defined blueprints for assembling multiple components to deploy a 5G network: Project X, a set of 5G Network Functions from Project Y, and so on. Each blueprint is backed by a Proof of Concept (typically a demo) showing the particular combination of components, along with supportive links to documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is reproducibility, the answer is Nix. It doesn't matter if you're using Python, Rust, C, Haskell, bash or some fresh hell written in PHP 4, Perl and a fork of Netscape from 1999. The Nix way _solves_ dependency management. Nix is a great way to build containers. I love the idea of the Dockerocker being a good enough for many circumstances for me to try it for me. There's a surprisingly strong standoffishness between the two communities of users, but that's a side point. I don't think anyone actually cares (except me), but I’m anal. I do it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming NetBIOS on OS/2 turned out to be far more difficult than it should have been. The code in question is the NetBIos interface of C-Kermit and was originally written in the early 1990s. The module uses two very similar but not identical code paths. The comments suggest that one alternative, using ACSNETB.DLL, is the “Traditional NetBios interface” used by IBM’s LAN Adapter and Protocol Support. The other code path is called “Newer Netbeui Interface” and is used by the Microsoft LAN Manager Requester, IBM LAN Server Requester and Novell Netware Requester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Boone: Why systemd is a problem for embedded Linux. He argues that it’s too slow for general-purpose desktop applications. He also argues that many of the complaints people make about it don’t stand up to much scrutiny, even the technical ones. He says that the majority of Linux users are uninterested in the pros and cons of the system. But he says that some people are violently opposed to it, and he has no solution to offer. He concludes that the problem is that the system is not suited to embedded Linux applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between “over 1GB of RAM” and 8MB RSS contains the vast majority of embedded Linux devices. It increases boot times (mentioned in the article) which is a pretty big deal on certain consumer products that aren’t always powered on. There are far better non-Linux open source options now than there used to be, which are by design better suited to running in constrained environments than a full blown Linux userland ever can be. There would have been a time when people would have said that 32MB is a crazy amount of memory to run Windows NT with an entire GUI! But that's not, and that's what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarize this text in one concise paragraph that capture the main points. If you need the money, don't take the job. If your goal is to work on the most interesting projects, I’d want to work full time. While consulting might be good for cash flow to hours-worked efficiency, it’s not clear it will make a person wealthier than other forms of income. It takes months, then requires training. Tech debt is twice as bad as the original crisis level when the new hire becomes value positive. Many consultants have a branding problem: Their biggest victories are fixing a disaster that their clients would not talk about publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historic Cruise Ships Are At Risk. Peter Knego Saves Them -  AFAR. This is where cruise ships go to die, where in January of 2015, the world’s largest shipbreaking event took place. The ship was the Italian liner Augustus Alang, India with former Italian liner. The gangway was gone, then there was just one way to get to the ship. It didn’t look like it was going to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No mention that the British Cunard liners, like the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, were subsidised by the government. The government loved having big fast ships it could requisition as troup carriers. The two queens were too fast to be intercepted by uboats. Mary moved 800k troups in WW2. As late as 1982 the Canberra was requisitioned and sent to the Falkland Islands conflict. A home rental company invested in buying an old ocean liner (the SS Rotterdam) to convert it to housing or an event center. It was a flop that cost them over a hundred million euros and led to a parlimentary investigation - since they're a housing company, that &gt;100 million should have been spent on building and maintaining their properties, including social housing, instead of risky investments in asbestos-ridden old ships. Nobody in their right mind tries to "save" an old cruise ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missing open-source contributor presents a dilemma when accepting their contribution – Better Software UK. A first-time contributor submits a PR to Spectre.Console, a Microsoft .Net Foundation open- source project. The contribution bot asks for confirmation the code change is copyright-free, but the contributor doesn’t respond. A more extensive contribution could prove to be problematic. So, I’ll consider an update to the PR template (and contributing guidelines) to state that all contributions are MIT-licensed and not to proceed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge, a Canadian energy company, just announced it’s moving forward with an 815-megawatt (MW) solar project called Sequoia in Texas. The project will be built in two phases, with power expected to start flowing in 2025 and 2026. Enbridge says it's taken steps to reduce risks by securing equipment and procurement contracts in advance. The deal was highlighted in Enbridge's third-quarter report on Friday. The automaker aims to achieve net zero by 2035 and match 45% of its purchased power with renewable electricity by 2026 as it still clings to its “diverse powertrain strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42031117"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of matching 45% of its purchased power with renewable electricity (in 2035) seems fairly average of what the typical grid user will likely get in 10 years. The word "matching" is what carries the implications. Texas has already started to curtail around 10% of solar production because of overproduction. Do we get fossil fuel displacement by producing energy that no one is willing to buy at even zero cost? To be fair it is likely a non-zero number, but it seems logical that as overproduction increases that numbers get closer to zero. Some of their HFC vehicles are net zero emission. Same cannot be said about EVs. But like you mentioned, the main reason why they try to do right by customers more than the others is to keep the money flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Article Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix 2.0.0 has been released to the public. It lets you build decentralised communication apps which outperform the mainstream centralised alternatives. There are four main pillars: instant login, instant launch, instant sync (aka Simplified Sliding Sync, MSC4186) and Matrix Encrypted Multiparty VoIP/Video (aka MatrixRTC, M SC4143 &amp; friends) The MSCs themselves are not all finalised and ready for merge (but are getting close), and when they pass FCP (Final Comment Period) to merge into the spec, we will formally bump the spec release to version 2. 0. Watch the launch right here: https:// youtube.com/watch?v=ZiRYdqkzjDU.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to host a homeserver but feel overwhelmed about the amount of services you’ll have to host, check out matrix- docker-ansible-deploy [1]. It’s pretty much a set and forget experience with reproducible deployment, and the documentation walks through any decision you need to make. It seems to be the only deployment method that supports hundreds of Matrix and related services which all tie together nicely. It's always a hassle to get it up &amp; running with a deployment that has been battle-tested and improved by hundreds of thousands of others. You're not alone, you're not standing alone.&lt;/p&gt;
