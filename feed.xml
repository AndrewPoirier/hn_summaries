            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really love Oxide to an unhealthy amount (it's become a bit of a meme among my colleagues), but sometimes I do wonder whether they went about their go-to-market the right way. They really tried to do everything at once - custom servers, custom router, custom rack, everything. Their accomplishments are technologically impressive, but, as somebody who is in a position to make purchasing decisions, not economically attractive. They're 3x more expensive than our existing hardware, two generations behind (I'm aware they're on track for a refresh) and don't have any GPUs. E.g. what I would have loved to see is just an after-market BMC/NIC/firmware solution using their stack. Plug it into a cheap Gigabyte system (their BMC is pluggable and NIC is OCP) and just have the control plane manage it as a whole box. I'd have easily paid serveral thousand $ per server just for that. All the rack scale integration, virtualization, migration, network storage, etc stuff is cool, but not everyone needs it. Get your foot in the door at customers, build up some volume for better deals with AMD, and then start building the custom rack stuff ... Of course it's easy to be a critic from the side lines. As I said, I do really love what the Oxide folks are doing, I just really hope it'll become possible for me to buy their gear at some point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; When we started Oxide, the DC bus bar stood as one of the most glaring differences between the rack-scale machines at the hyperscalers and the rack-and-stack servers that the rest of the market was stuck with. That a relatively simple piece of copper was unavailable to commercial buyersIt seems that 0xide was founded in 2019 and Open Compute Project had been specifying dc bus bars for 6 years at that point. People could purchase racks if they wanted, but it seems like, by large, people didn't care enough to go whole hog in on it.Wonder if the economics have changed or if it's still just neat but won't move the needle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really wish Oxide had homelab/prosumer grade stuff. I'd be sending them so much money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42206990</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi, I’m the “greg”. AMA??But also, this is Rafal’s project. I’m just a huge huge fan of his..! See:https://sit.sonnet.io/https://untested.sonnet.io/And https://www.potato.horse/ !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;To my knowledge, this can be fixed by requesting the OS-level accessibility permissions, which would require a separate user interaction.Does this imply that running Gregglogger _doesn't_ require granting accessibility input monitoring permission? On osx there's at least 4 ways to monitor inputs I think (iokit level, cgeventap, carbon event monitoring, cocoa global event monitor), I'd really expect all of them to require the input monitoring permission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux, especially wayland, is making keylogging and keypress manipulation really hard. This is hitting me in one of my passions: retro gaming.I WANNA DO MACROS, but I haven't found any good solution for macros in linux (think dragon punch in Street Fighter or some other complex HID input sequence that teenies can master but oldass me can't)And I understand why, it's a massive security problem, giving view powers to the keystream, to say nothing of manipulation.I hope that retroarch eventually adds it, but they punt on it currently I think for the exact reasons I have problems with it.Does anyone know any good solutions out there for X.org and Wayland?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147612</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The document is a court ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia regarding a case involving the federal government and certain parties. It addresses legal arguments and evidence presented by both sides, ultimately leading to the court's decision on motions filed. The ruling outlines the court's reasoning, discusses precedents, and specifies the implications of the decision for the parties involved. Key details include the assessment of legal standards applicable to the case and the conclusions drawn by the judge in relation to the presented facts and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has already been discussed extensively in prior threads, but the biggest question is, how does a spun-off Chrome get funded?Chrome/Firefox/Safari all cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year to maintain. Currently, Safari and Firefox both make essentially all their revenue through default search agreements. Chrome, Edge, and now Brave are produced by companies that also own the search engines, so they're essentially a loss-generating product, that exist because they cancel out distribution costs that Google and Microsoft would otherwise have to pay other browsers.But the DOJ order is also asking to ban payments between search engines and browser makers:
&gt; As detailed in Section IV, the PFJ prohibits Google from providing third parties something of value (including financial payments) in order to make Google the default general search engine or otherwise discouraging those third parties from offering competing search productsWith that revenue gone, the only real options to fund a browser are:* Directly charge users for it. This is effectively a non-starter, because the vast majority of people aren't willing to pay for it.* Insert ads or sell user data - users also hate this, it's probably not legal in the EU, and it may not be legal in most of the US in the future either.* Use the browser as a platform to push some product that does make money - a non-Google search engine? A social network? An LLM interface?Alternatively, a narrow reading of the proposed order is that this only applies to Google. In that case, perhaps Bing or OpenAI takes over all the distribution agreements and becomes the top search engine. Whether that's better for consumers seems fairly questionable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google's response: 
"DOJ’s staggering proposal would hurt consumers and America’s global technological leadership" https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-s...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page 12 is also very interesting to me personally, as it contains orders mandating the opening of Google’s search index to their competitors. I had been wondering if that would make it in there and am happy to see it land.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42201261</guid></item><item><title>50. /usr/bin/env -S uv run</title><link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/21/usrbinenv-uv-run/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other neat tricks with uvx (uv equivalent of npx) to run one time commands in some contexts:- alias download_mp3="uvx --no-cache --from yt-dlp[default] yt-dlp --extract-audio --audio-format mp3" to download sound from Youtube videos, SoundCloud pages, etc. This update yt-dlp every time, which is required given the counter measures change so often and the dl rarely affect the total processing time anyway (requires ffmpeg).- "uvx --with &lt;package&gt; --with pyqt5 --from qtconsole jupyter qtconsole" starts a qtconsole (GUI version of ipython) with &lt;package&gt; installed so you can test it quickly. Temp venv, everything cached so next time it's instant, one single copy of pyqt5 for the current use no matter how many times you run those.- "uvx --with virtualenv pipx run pipsi install nodejs-bin". Ok it's useless, but it's fun that it even works :)uv's cache system and downloads optimization are quite smart, as Charlie marsh (astral CEO) explains in the interview: https://www.bitecode.dev/p/charlie-marsh-on-astral-uv-and-th...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While neat, doesn't it also comes with certain issues?Startup times has to be slower, but probably only for the first run?There's a some level of violation of the "Principle Of Least Surprise", depending on the setting. For some it will be the reverse, the script they got just works, without any setup or package installation. For others we'll wonder why it just started downloading a bunch of packages we already have.Probably not the greatest idea for production environments, where you should not or can not just pull in packages from the internet.It's really cool that it works, but I think I'd recommended using it highly selectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this for a few weeks now, and it's really handy. But I did learn the hard way that it fails if you don't have internet connection, even if you already have the venv cached.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42198256</guid></item><item><title>1.

My favorite challenge was avoiding the glowing white dots along the path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This game is way better than it needs to be for a quick burst of advertising. Not only is the implementation fantastic, with perfect controls, but the level design is also great. I really enjoyed the multiple routes and the fact you can skip most of the advertising displays.It seems such a shame that this isn't a full game. Removing the advertising and adding more complex levels with puzzles would make for a perfect little distraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm one of the developers who worked on this project.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I ask "what is TiDB" in the demo as suggested, and it takes 2 minutes to start responding in the midst of a multi-stage workflow with several steps each of graph retrieval, vector search, generation, and response combination.Each of these is individually cool, but it strikes me as tragic that so much effort has been put into an intricate workflow and beautifully crafted UI only to culminate in a completely useless hello-world example, which after 5+ minutes of successive querying and response-building concludes with a network error.I could use this to build exactly what I need...after stripping out 80% of the features to make it streamlined and responsive.Why isn't that minimal version the default?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this wholly self-hostable? I'd be curious to run something like this on a home server, have some small model via ollama slowly chew through my documents / conversations / receipts / .... and provide a chat-like search engine over the whole mess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks a lot, this is the first time i saw a RAG using DSPy. I wanted to know about the expected cost. A few days ago fast graphrag compared their implementation with Microsoft:&gt; Using The Wizard of Oz, fast-graphrag costs $0.08 vs. graphrag $0.48 — a 6x costs saving that further improves with data size and number of insertions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210689</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a comprehensive overview of Bayesian networks, emphasizing their significance in probabilistic graphical models. It explains the foundational concepts behind Bayesian inference, detailing how these networks facilitate decision-making processes in the presence of uncertainty. The resource includes visualizations and interactive elements to enhance understanding, guiding readers through constructing and interpreting Bayesian networks while showcasing practical applications in various fields, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bayesian Neural Networks just seem like a failed approach, unfortunately.
For one, Bayesian inference and UQ fundamentally depends on the choice of the prior, but this is rarely discussed in the Bayesian NN literature and practice, and is further compounded by how fundamentally hard to interpret and choose these priors are (what is the intuition behind a NN's parameters?). Add to that the fact that the Bayesian inference is very much approximate, and you should see the trouble.If you want UQ, 'frequentist nonparametric' approaches like Conformal Prediction and Calibration/Multi-Calibration methods seem to work quite well (especilly when combined with the standard ML machinery of taking a log-likelihood as your loss), and do not suffer from any of the issues above while also giving you formal guarantees of correctness. They are a strict improvement over Bayesian NNs, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What frustrates me about Bayesian NNs is that talking about "priors" doesn't make nearly as much sense as it does in a regression context. A prior over parameter weights has no interpretation in the way that a prior over a regression coefficient, or even a spline smoothness, does. What you really want -- and what natural intelligence probably has -- are priors over aspects of the world.Francois Chollet's paper on measuring intelligence was really informative for me on this front; the "priors" you should have about the world are not half-cauchys over certain hyperparameters or whatever, but priors about agent-ness, object-ness, goal-oriented-ness, and so on. How to encode that in a network...well, that's the real trick, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here!  What a surprise.  This was an abandoned project from 2019, that we never linked or advertised anywhere as far as I know.  Anyways, happy to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174181</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon plans to invest an additional $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading AI company and competitor to OpenAI. This investment is aimed at enhancing Amazon's capabilities in artificial intelligence and strengthening its cloud computing services through Anthropic's advanced AI technologies. The partnership signifies Amazon's commitment to the AI field and reflects the ongoing competition among major tech firms to leverage AI innovations for their platforms and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious if anyone knows the logistics of these cloud provider/AI company deals.  In this case, it seems like the terms of the deal mean that Anthropic ends up spending most of the investment on AWS to pay for training.Does anthropic basically get at cost pricing on AWS?  If Amazon has any margin on their pricing, it seems like this $4B investment ends up costing them a lot less, and this is a nice way to turn a cap ex investment into AWS revenue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anthropic should double down on the strategy of being the better code generator. No I don't need an AI agent to call the restaurant for me. Win the developers over and the rest will follow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They certainly need the money. The Pro service has been running in limited mode all week due to being over capacity. It defaults to “concise” mode during high capacity but Pro users can select to put it back into “Full Response.” But I can tell the quality drops even when you do that, and it fails and brings up error messages more commonly. They don’t have enough compute to go around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215126</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the successful return of salmon to historic spawning habitats in the Klamath River following the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The removal of four dams has significantly improved the river's ecosystem, allowing salmon to lay eggs in areas that had been inaccessible for many years. The project is seen as a major ecological restoration effort that not only benefits the salmon population but also enhances the overall health of the river. The return of salmon is celebrated by local communities and environmental advocates as a significant step toward restoring natural biodiversity in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

Butterflies knowing where to fly even though it was their grandparents that last did it - eels traveling thousands of miles to breed in a place theyve never seen - countless bird migrations - even something as simple as how it takes a human baby 12-18 months to walk but many animals walk as soon as they are born.  I would love to understand better how this knowledge is inherited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animal behavior usually has a weird combination of inborn instinct and learned behavior.The one I've read about that stuck with me was dam building by beavers.  Some part of the behavior is driven by a dislike of the sound of running water.  Someone did an experiment with speakers playing the sound of running water and the beavers near the speakers would attempt to cover them with sticks and mud.In my head I'm imaging that sound is like nails on a chalkboard to beaver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read a fascinating article on this dam removal last week! https://hakaimagazine.com/features/the-other-side-of-the-wor...The article tells both sides of the story of the dam removal in as fair a way as I think is possible. Many of the locals were against it and there was a strong advocacy group that fought for it, including a tribal constituency.I came away from the article feeling I understood both sides better but with less certainty about what was the right choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213663</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bindless is pretty much _the_ most important feature we need in WebGPU. Other stuff can be worked around to varying degrees of success, but lack of bindless makes our state changes extremely frequent, which heavily kills performance with how expensive WebGPU makes changing state. The default texture limits without bindless are also way too small for serious applications - just implementing the glTF PBR spec + extensions will blow past them.I'm really looking forward to getting bindless later down the road, although I expect it to take quite a while.By the same token, I'm quite surprised that effort is being put into a compatibility mode, when WebGPU is already too old and limiting for a lot of people, and when WebGL(2) is going to have to be maintained by browsers anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any word on when it'll be supported on Linux without a flag?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux support please!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42209272</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"As part of the calibration, the speed of sound is also a parameter which is optimized to obtain the best model of the system, which allows this whole procedure to act as a ridiculously overengineered thermometer."Reminds me of the electronics adage: "all sensors are temperature sensors, some measure other things as well."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once did a project to do multilateration of bats (the flying mammal) using an array of 4 microphones arranged in a big Y shape on the ground. Using the time difference of arrival at the four microphones, we could find the positions of each bat that flew over the array, as well as identify the species. It was used for an environmental study to determine the impact of installing wind turbines. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious, why haven't you used TDM I2S microphones for your array and used PDM?I understand that ICS-52000 is a relatively low cost ($2/100pcs) and there are even breakout boards available with 4 microphones, which can be chained to 8 or 16, like https://www.cdiweb.com/datasheets/notwired/ds-nw-aud-ics5200...Then you can take Jetson (or any I2S capable hardware with DSP or GPU on it) and chain 16 microphones per I2S port. It would seem a lot easier to assemble and probgam, if comared to FPGA setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215552</guid></item><item><title>8.

I am suspicious of all these coatings they're slapping on compostable food containers these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;these plastics that will break down are designed to fix the problems of plastics... which problems are that plastics break down. We only need for plastics to break down more because they've already broken down, into microplastics and god knows what else.I want to go in the other direction, plastics that simply don't break down, ever. Plastic laundry baskets with handles that keep being handles. Slick looking rubbery objects that don't turn into a sticky mess. We never thought of plastics as a pollutant because we thought plastics wouldn't break down. Make it so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't tell if this is similar to PHA or not, but that's a plastic you can buy for 3d printing today that is touted to break down in seawater. https://www.fabbaloo.com/news/pha-colorfabbs-fully-biodegrad...This is their site: https://colorfabb.us/filaments/materials/pha-filaments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210528</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have the exact same problem with this article that I had with the previous one - the author fails to provide any data on the frequency of illegal moves.Thus it's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions. It would be similar to if I claimed that an LLM is an expert doctor, but in my data I've filtered out all of the times it gave incorrect medical advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For one, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct rarely suggests illegal moves, even in the late game.It's claimed that this model "understands" chess, and can "reason", and do "actual logic" (here in the comments).I invite anyone making that claim to find me an "advanced amateur" (as the article says of the LLM's level) chess player who ever makes an illegal move. Anyone familiar with chess can confirm that it doesn't really happen.Is there a link to the games where the illegal moves are made?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For one, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct rarely suggests illegal moves, even in the late game. This requires “understanding” chess.Here's one way to test whether it really understands chess. Make it play the next move in 1000 random legal positions (in which no side is checkmated yet). Such positions can be generated using the ChessPositionRanking project at [1]. Does it still rarely suggest illegal moves in these totally weird positions, that will be completely unlike any it would have seen in training (and in which the legal move choice is often highly restricted) ?While good for testing legality of next moves, these positions are not so useful for distinguishing their quality, since usually one side already has an overwhelming advantage.[1] https://github.com/tromp/ChessPositionRanking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42206817</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the process of converting a string of code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) through parsing. It explores the significance of ASTs in programming language interpretation and compilation, detailing how parsing works, the role of tokenization, and different parsing techniques. The author provides a practical example illustrating the parsing process and emphasizes the importance of ASTs in understanding the structure and intent of code for various applications, including code analysis and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a really great read! I'm wrote the tree sitter grammar for the Unison programming language, and discovered I really like the work involved in pattern matching that writing tokenizers and parsers comes down to. It also gives you an in-depth understanding of how the language works that you've writing a parser for, and how tooling works.Like if you have an AST with the ability to map onto code that is displayed in your IDE, the algorithm for an IDE to refactor a variable name is to traverse up the AST until you get to the variable's declaration and then traverse all sibling trees, changing each matching name, but stopping a traversal whenever you encounter a new binding with same name. Code folding is to identify the categories of node that are "foldable" and then you hide every child of that node. Etc. It's all tree traversal algorithms.It gives you a deep appreciation for how powerful the tooling can be thanks to proper parsing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; quadruple G=(N,Σ,P,S), where T is a finite set of nonterminal symbols, Σ a finite set of terminal symbols, P is a set of production rules and S is a start symbol.I think "T" is supposed to be "N" in that sentence[1], based solely upon the further use of "N" nomenclature in subsequent paragraphs1: he said, 5 years too late into a forum just discussing the article&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to review some of this theory after a week of coding my own interpreter. I have been studying about compilers at pikuma.com the whole week and reading this article after coding a parser is a great way of reviewing what I've implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213322</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the influence of Niccolò Machiavelli on the concept of the private study during the Renaissance. It discusses how Machiavelli's writings promoted the idea of individual thought and personal reflection, contrasting the communal learning practices of earlier periods. The piece examines the implications of this shift towards private study on intellectual development and the nature of political discourse, emphasizing the significant role that Machiavelli's work played in shaping modern notions of authorship and knowledge. Through this lens, the article highlights the broader cultural changes occurring during the Renaissance that fostered the emergence of personal intellectual spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of mixins in C++, which are a form of multiple inheritance allowing classes to inherit methods and properties from multiple sources. It explains how mixins can enhance code reusability and modularity, offering a cleaner way to compose classes. The piece further illustrates the implementation of mixins with code examples and provides guidance on their best practices, while highlighting the benefits and potential pitfalls associated with their use in C++ programming.&lt;/p&gt;

It was removed. Many years ago now I think.A signature resembles a class declaration in that it specifies member functions. A signature is never instantiated. Rather any class which has those member functions conforms to the signature, and a signature-typed pointer can point to instances of that class. Thus signatures bring about quack-like-a-duck polymorphism not requiring inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;

Can't have optional references in C++. Use either std::reference_wrapper, or just a pointer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182113</guid></item><item><title>15.

Thank you for your warm words, and a bunch of feedback. I created the project mainly to learn about Svelte and play with algorithms, these running bars fascinate me. I was hoping that this tool would also help understand how sorting algorithms work.
I still have a few features planned, such as advanced statistics.If you have any ideas on how to develop this or want to contribute with me, I would be happy to invite youI would also like to thank you for the stars on Github, it is really satisfying when someone enjoys the fruit of my work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oooh, bogosort led me to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort and divine sort:Divine sort
    A sorting algorithm that takes a list and decides that because there is such a low probability that the list randomly occurred in its current permutation (a probability of 1/n!, where n is the number of elements), there must have been a reason for the list's order. Therefore, it should be considered sorted in a way we don't understand, and we do not have any right to sort it to our beliefs, as if it were sorted "as God intended." Also known as Intelligent Design sort.[11]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also made a sorting visualizer based on a popular imgur sorting gifs  gallery.Demo https://xosh.org/VisualizingSorts/sorting.htmlPost https://xosh.org/sorting-algorithms-visual-comparison/Imgur gallery I was trying to replicate https://imgur.com/a/voutFThis also let you try out your own sorting algorithm too btw and share that in url. For example this algo  https://xosh.org/VisualizingSorts/sorting.html#IYZwngdgxgBAZ... which was discussed at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31975507(Dont turn on sound, i dont know how to make it sound nicer)The detail slider is a manual thing. You put the render call with 1/2/3 level in the loop. Only the lines with same render level will be displayed. Can be used to see the sorting at different granularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171096</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this an actually good explanation? The introduction immediately made me pause:&gt; In classical computers, error-resistant memory is achieved by duplicating bits to detect and correct errors. A method called majority voting is often used, where multiple copies of a bit are compared, and the majority value is taken as the correct bitNo in classical computers memory is corrected for using error correction not duplicating bits and majority voting. Duplicating bits would be a very wasteful strategy if you can add significantly fewer bits and achieve the same result which is what you get with error correction techniques like ECC. Maybe they got it confused with logic circuits where there’s not any more efficient strategy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, they managed to make a website that scales everything except the main text when adjusting the browser's zoom setting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the paper they are referring to was published August 27, 2024https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13687&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42215910</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the life and career of songwriter and musician Jim Croce, whose hit songs, particularly "Time in a Bottle," achieved immense commercial success, surpassing even The Beatles in sales at one point. Despite this achievement, Croce remains relatively unknown compared to other music legends, largely due to his tragic death in a plane crash shortly after reaching peak popularity. The piece delves into Croce's background, his musical style, the impact of his short-lived career, and the lingering questions about why he hasn't been more widely recognized in music history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NeuralDEM project focuses on integrating deep learning techniques with digital elevation models (DEMs) to enhance terrain analysis and interpretation. It presents a method for generating high-resolution DEMs using neural networks, aiming to improve accuracy in geographical and environmental studies. The website outlines the methodology, provides code implementations, and showcases various applications and results from the research, highlighting the advantages of leveraging artificial intelligence in topographic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some previous work by some of the same people [0] where I was taking part in. Seems like this is a significant step up from the previous work including a novel idea that resolves quite a few issues we had. Love to see that.[0]: https://ml-jku.github.io/bgnn/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is nice, but I believe a simpler design could work better.Simply make a model which transforms a 3d section of an image to an embedding vector.   Make another model which can reverse the process (ie. encoder-decoder).  Do that for every tile of a starting state.Make an 'upscale' and 'downscale' model which can take a grid of embedding vectors and return a new vector representing the whole.Then make an 'advance time' model, which takes an embedding vector and advances time by a given number of seconds/microseconds/days.Now train all the models end to end to ensure that all combinations of upscaling/downscaling/advancing/encoding/decoding produce similar outputs to traditional physics models.Use an ensemble of models or a sampling scheme to find places where outputs do not closely match, and insert more training data from the physical simulation at those points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I wonder what parts of this approach could be adapted to DEM models of solids. For those unaware - even though DEM is naturally chosen for fluids, depending on how you configure the force laws between particles you can easily model solids as well, where each particle is essentially a chunk of material. There are then some interesting choices to make about (a) what kind of lattice you set the initial particles up in, and (b) how you tune the force flaws to get the macroscopic properties you want around stiffness, etc and (c) if you use multiple “types” of particles forming a composite etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42145735</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a Linux malware variant named Wolfsbane, which is associated with the Gelsemium malware family, previously known for targeting Windows systems. It provides insights into the functionality and behavior of Wolfsbane, highlighting how it mimics the capabilities of its predecessor, Gelsevirine. The research details the infection process, propagation methods, and potential targets, as well as the implications for cybersecurity.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like their malware relies on a couple of things:- intended target is KDE and GNOME- privilege escalation through LD_PRELOAD hooking from userland via open, stat, readdir access (of any other program that the user executes, see down below)- persistence through display manager config for KDE- persistence through desktop autostart files for GNOME- fallback persistence through .bashrc,  profile or profile.sh in /etc- installs trojanized ssh client version- installs a JSP webshell- sideloads kernel module as libselinux.so and .ko module. Probably the rootkit helpers to access them from userlandDespite the snarky comments in here, this malware is actually quite sophisticated.If you don't agree, I challenge you now to measure the time it takes for you to find all .so files on your system that are loaded right now, and have been modified since your package manager installed them.My point being that there is no EDR on Linux that catches this (apart from ours that's WIP), because all existing tools are just checking for windows malware hashes (not even symbols) as they're intended for linux fileservers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I am skimming this correctly, this is a C&amp;C client allowing remote control over the network, and uses "a rootkit" for further compromise once it somehow gets installed?I understand the value of in-depth security reports, but the 5th time they told me "WolfsBane is the Linux counterpart of Gelsevirine, while FireWood is connected to Project Wood." I was wondering when I'd get to the meat and potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These things always get really cool names, like "Wolfsbane" and "firewood". makes me want to make some malware to see what cool name security researchers give it lol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42208580</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting.  Goed gedaan!Note the title of the book should be Een Waarlijk Vrije; i.e. the last word has a j.Curious that DeepL translated "Gaf geen kamp" to "gave a camp", since "geen" means no/none.  It seemed to totally ignore it or reverse it's meaning.Regarding "droving" perhaps "herding" might be a more familiar term.  And it might be more accurate; I suspect that long distance herding wasn't a common thing in the Netherlands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve got my great-grandfather’s autobiography and one of the striking features is the language. It’s extremely matter of fact with very little prose to connect his life together, just a lot of details like “moved to X in year Y” and “went to school for X between Y and Z years”. It’s got a lot of facts, but little coherent narrative.If someone is important enough to warrant a biographer they’ll put more work into the narrative but old autobiographies seem to be very mechanical records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great read ! My father has published 12 books in his native language, I am in process of converting them in English using chatgpt.

It's the first time I have been able to re-experience a skin made in 2004 called Impulse. I can't even remember when I last used it.Loading it from the URL on the page linked below, it mostly works! Impressed that most of the animations came across.stephango.com/impulse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love this project and I've been following 'winamp skins bot' on mastodon and Twitter previously for a while. Fun blast to the past: https://indieweb.social/@winampskins@botsin.spacePotentially a small correction, I think the 'new' skins were introduced with Winamp 3 not 5. 5 was released because 3 was disliked, and incorporated both features from 2 and 3 (2+3 = 5)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reviewed 1000s of skins and plugins at nullsoft before aol so many of them tie to a time in my life.

Apparently it’s media. Maybe it’s a headless browser that can capture inputs and stream them?Re reading the readme and trying to figure out what each discrete part does made me realize it feels like if ChatGPT had designed a generic, non descript product, and made a readme. It’s got a file that tells me there are things in it. The code does stuff. This is definitely what a product looks like to a human.Philip K Dick described that to see information is to be consumed by it. This feels exactly that way. Presented with something that has just enough meaning to feel “figure out able“.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand what this does.  It says it "broadcasts media content retrieved from web pages".What does broadcast mean?  Like what if the media is a PDF or a PNG?  Is it a static file proxy server?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the use case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210022</guid></item><item><title>25.

And all the time your soul is craving and longing for something else. And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking in these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Substack post is a summary of an essay by Joseph Brodsky about Dostoevsky — but the post does not link or name the essay.The essay is named "The Power of the Elements" and it can be read here on Google Books:https://www.google.com/books/edition/Less_Than_One/N5Nzm2uih...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite course I took in college was a Russian Literature elective my first semester. I fell in love with Dostoevsky when we read Crime and Punishment and I ended up writing my 25 page term paper on him and his role in the proto-existentialist vs nihilism movement in Russia in the 1860s.

I've done a number of small radio projects with it and friends over the years, including some wild things like mixing 10+ remote drone musicians together into a single feed with just liquidsoap behind icecast and I don't feel like I've begun to scrape the surface of what it can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I admittedly misread the title and thought that some people are creatively repurposing this audio streaming program for transferring IQ datastreams for Software defined radio (SDR) receivers... It may be actually doable with some hacking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never quite got to fix my issues with firefox stopping playing my radio stream after changing songs. It just happens occasionally though I haven't tried recently to see if the problem is still there. At some point I thought liquidsoap cured this but it didn't. Also when I was into that, I got the feeling most of the internet didn't care about radio streams anymore since video streaming is the standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182557</guid></item><item><title>30.

This means you can append data to an object up to 10,000 times."That 10,000 parts limit means this isn't quite the solution for writing log files directly to S3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The original title is "Amazon S3 Express One Zone now supports the ability to append data to an object" and the difference is extremely important! I was excited for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For comparison, while GCS doesn't support appends directly, there's hacky but effective workaround in that you can compose existing objects together into new objects, without having to read &amp; write the data. If you have existing object A, upload new object B, and compose A and B together so that the resulting object is also called A, this effectively functions the same as appending B into A.https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/composite-objects#appe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211280</guid></item><item><title>31.

Oh, it seems to be something you need to install via npm.I cannot help but to ask - why do we require npm, or Vite, for something that looks like it should "help" with CSS?Why is the webdev such a shitshow, that seems to get ever deeper into its own weird rabbit hole?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've never had as much fun doing front-end web stuff as I've had since I've picked up tailwind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are switching from sRGB to OKLCH.First time I heard of OKLCH tbh. Anyone know if that is part of a wider adoption trend or is Tailwind pioneering here?Looking at the examples it does seem to offer some advantages; but was primarily surprised that they now use it as a default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210553</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The project "lean-smt" on GitHub is focused on providing a way to integrate SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers into the Lean theorem prover. It aims to enhance Lean's capability to handle complex logical reasoning by enabling users to leverage various SMT solvers for verification tasks. The repository contains the necessary code, documentation, and instructions for installation and usage, facilitating developers and researchers to utilize Lean in combination with SMT technology for formal verification and proof development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of traits in programming, particularly in the context of Rust and other languages, suggesting that while they provide useful structure and reusability, they can also become a limiting factor in design. The author argues that traits should not be viewed as the ultimate solution for code organization but rather as a local maximum that can restrict creativity and flexibility in programming. The piece encourages developers to explore alternative paradigms and structures that may lead to more innovative solutions, rather than relying solely on traits.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the problem of ad hoc polymorphism so interesting. It’s clearly a desirable feature, but we’ve been trying for nearly fifty years and still don’t have a solution that everyone’s unambiguously happy with. Compare that to, like, lexical scoping or parametric polymorphism, which most languages just have by default at this point. They’re almost mathematical facts.And you’d hope there’d be a way to do it. Parametric polymorphism feels underpowered if you can’t make any assumptions about the things you’re abstracting over. But it might be a Halting Problem-esque situation.FWIW if a real, near-trade-off-free solution exists, I think it’ll require a bit of a Copernican revolution in how we approach things. I don’t have any real insight to offer there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What an excellent write-up, and very entertaining at that.I suspect that most devs will prefer the local maximum that traits are.  Perhaps with a bit more help to ensure there's only ever one implementation of a given trait -- think of a trait registry.  One might still allow multiple implementations, but with one single one chosen at final link-edit time or, if linking dynamically, at run time.  To support something like that the registrations in the trait registry would have to be exacting as to each trait's semantics.  A registry has its own cost: friction, and someone has to be a registrar, and registration might have a cost.  But a registry has its advantages, and one could have namespaced traits, too, to enable multiple registries/registrars.  Registries might feel like a hack, but so what, compared to the problems with implicits, they might be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust just doesn’t really have linker errors.After 8 years of programming ~exclusively in Rust it’s easy for me to take this for granted by forgetting that linker errors even exist — until I am rudely reminded by occasional issues with C/C++ code that ends up in the dep tree.This property is downstream of the orphan rules, and given the benefit I wouldn’t give them up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177984</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fun part is that in some cases just listing the iptables rules with an iptables -L will cause it to load the conntrack module and the default max for this is very low for anything that is a DNS server or perform a lot of DNS lookups.   That's why it's a good idea to always set the sysctl nf_conntrack_max value quite high even if you aren't using conntrack.  The actual sysctl key for nf_conntrack is different depending on the version of the kernel, it's net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a terrible website. It moves the viewport around and interferes with scrolling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sounds like bad advice, I don't know why ISC is pushing this...  they would be better off trying to make DNS a TCP-only service to stop amplification attacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42207893</guid></item><item><title>35.

I "beta tested" the tunnel a few times before it opened.One bug we discovered was that it was common for us in the South-East of England to travel regularly over to France, fill our cars up to breaking point with duty-free booze and cigarettes and come home. The problem with the Chunnel trains is that the cars enter at one end and drive through the train. On the way back from France none of our cars could get over the "hump" between the coaches.
They look flat now, so they must have reengineered them:https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ins...Second bug was getting out halfway through and walking through the fire escape tunnels. They have a PA system for the fire crews to issue instructions. But it has a 26 mile long echo. So you can't hear anything.https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaguarcarsmena/43994120214/in/...https://www.theheritageportal.co.za/sites/default/files/styl...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I reading this right? Is the only protocol being supported now the most recent version of IRC? Are there plans for others? Part of Pidgin's "calling card" has been its ability to support many different chat protocols. However, that's become difficult since most protocols have become walled gardens and harder to reverse engineer. I'd imagine supporting Matrix, XMPP, Signal, other protocols with open specifications, etc. would be a good idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to see pidgin still alive and kicking!I hate to have different apps for similar stuff and I also prefer "native" clients over web UIs so I used pidgin a lot in my life. I impressed many people with its "telepathic" feature that would open a chat when someone starts typing, to let you type in something before they even finish their initial sentence. Fun times…However, when I finally got a smartphone, and started a more conventional line of work which came with extra devices, I switched to grouping my chats using server-side gateways for better multi-device consistency. I started by using Spectrum [1] which leverages on libpurple (pidgin's "backend") to do that. Since spectrum is on life support (maintenance mode, no modern chat features like emoji reactions which I happen to like despite my old age), I actually started my own hobby project [2], because I'm not really interested in learning C++ (which spectrum is written in). (shameless plug, I know)The hype these days is more around mautrix [3], but the permacomputing enthusiasth in me prefers XMPP over Matrix. I'm not that religious about it though, my gateway project includes the most feature-rich XMPP/Matrix gateway out there [4] which I try to improve and maintain when time and motivation allow it. Unfortunately, XMPP support in pidgin has historically been pretty poor and IMHO partly responsible for some of the hate XMPP gets. I'm not blaming the pidgin devs of course, I should contribute to libpurple-xmpp (if that's how it's called) instead of complaining. ^^[1] https://spectrum.im/

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a decision by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that classifies Apple as a "bank-like" entity due to its expanding financial services, such as Apple Pay and the Apple Card. This new designation means that Apple will be subject to additional regulations and oversight similar to traditional banks, including protections for consumers relating to fees and reporting. The move reflects the increasing intersection of technology and finance, emphasizing the need for regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

It's Apple, Google and Amazon, PayPal, Block, Venmo and Zelle.[1] Everybody with over 50,000,000 transactions annually gets CFPB oversight. Actual rule: [2]This doesn't really do much. It creates no consumer rights. It does give CFPB examiners the power to examine records and interview people. It means that numbers such as how many PayPal customers have complaints will be looked at. Bank examiners look at error rates, fraud losses, unresolved complaints, and such. The effect will probably be that some of the big players with weak customer service will have to get their act together.[1] https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-final...[2] https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_final-rul...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's written like it's a strange thing:&gt; role is normally limited to banks and financial services companies.Was anyone expecting a system that handles 6 trillion dollars a year to not fall under financial regulatory purview?Which I realise is not the actual thrust of the rule change (obviously they were already under some regs already), but it's just such an odd intro.Apple withdrawing Pay Later when it became clear they'd need to comply with lending regs is quite telling too. Presumably they were attempting to sneak in the back door and claim "it's tech not banking" and got told they're not above the law when the Truth in Lending Act was confirmed to cover the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who runs an actual bank, the headlines around this story are super misleading. In no meaningful way will be Apple be treated like a bank in the way that we generally expect banks to be treated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211525</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concepts of key transparency and the right to be forgotten within the context of blockchain technology and data privacy. It emphasizes the importance of making cryptographic keys accessible and understandable to users while balancing this transparency with individuals' rights to control their personal information. The piece explores the implications of these ideas for society, technology, and legal frameworks, highlighting the ongoing challenges of achieving a balance between security and privacy in an increasingly digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is well-written and a potentially good application for crypto-shredding, which has a lot of drawbacks in other contexts.The issue with crypto-shredding in many applications is that it aggressively pessimizes the software architectures possible in support of the data model. For things like databases and analytics, that feature increases the required hardware footprint -- compute and storage -- by orders of magnitude. The loss of efficiency has little to do with the crypto per se, since hardware support makes that cheap, but with how the change in representation interacts with idiomatic data structures and algorithms for high-efficiency data systems.Many system internals are essentially a bag of tricks for constructing the maximally compressive representation of the important relationships in a data model while preserving practical tractability of operations over the data model. Crypto-shredding architectures have the effect of "encrypting" before "compressing", rendering the latter moot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that “PII” is American terminology, and it has a much more restricted meaning than the European term “personal data”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m confused about the purpose of truncating the salt.How does the attacker learn anything about the salt without breaking Argon2id first?  It’s not like the salt is included in the Sigsum ledger.If the attacker did somehow learn the salt (truncated HMAC), it seems like that would immediately break security, regardless of truncation.  Suppose the attacker starts with a dictionary of all possible Actor IDs, which seems reasonable, and that they calculate the truncated HMAC for every possibility until it matches.  Due to the truncation, the attacker may get one or more false username matches in addition to the true username match.  But if the attacker has narrowed down the username to two or three possibilities, they’ve already basically won.  And they could just check the possibilities against Argon2id to learn which one it is.On the other hand, if the attacker doesn’t know anything about the salt, then why would it matter if the salt did uniquely identify a user?  How would they “observe that the recent-merkle-root is the same for two messages, but their salts differ”?It’s quite possible that I’m misunderstanding something.  I am not a cryptography expert.But more broadly, it just seems wrong to use a salted password hash but have the salt be based on the same password that’s being hashed.  I don’t think it’s _insecure_, because the salt also includes a high-entropy part (the recent-merkle-root).  But I don’t see how it increases security at all.  The security should be the same as if the salt only included the high-entropy part.In other words, the entire “HMAC -&gt; truncate -&gt; Argon2id” process can be seen as a password hash in its own right, where the input consists of the secret username, plus various bits of public information such as the recent-merkle-root.  But that’s essentially a form of rolling your own crypto, and it’s unnecessary.  Argon2id is already a secure password hash by itself, so you can just feed that data directly to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210605</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the proposed PrevAIL Act, which aims to amend the U.S. patent review system. It argues that the act would undermine the effectiveness of the current system by making it harder to challenge unjust patents, thereby favoring patent holders and corporations over innovation and competition. The authors express concern that the changes could lead to an increase in frivolous patents and a decrease in the overall quality of patents, ultimately harming consumers and the tech industry. They urge policymakers to recognize the importance of maintaining a robust patent review process to protect fair competition and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that surprised me the most about it is that FedEx didn't just pay them the 400k for lost shipment. They had all the proof that it was lost, all that Fedex had was a signature of someone who doesn't even work at their fulfilment centre. Even after their "higher ups" got involved all that FedEx could do was "huh, sucks to be you I guess?" Does freight shipment not have insurance? What's going on here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to buy a playdate when they first came out, but unfortunately they weren't shipping to my country.Now they do, so I just placed an order 15 mins ago and my partner just received a call from the bank to verify that it wasn't a fraudulent transaction.She just asked me - what is this "play date" you just sent $300 to? Oh dear. :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting choice to go with a PI who's focused on recovery rather than criminal convinctions. Given the lack of sophistication in this operation, I suspect recovery would have happened either way, and the thieves might have faced some actual consequences. As is, they didn't lose anything other than the stolen items and will likely continue to capitalize on similar opportunities in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211689</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of the "Birthday Paradox," which demonstrates how counterintuitive probability can be when assessing chances of shared birthdays among a group of people. It breaks down the calculations to show that in a group of just 23 individuals, there is a surprisingly high 50% chance that at least two people will share the same birthday. The analysis includes visual representations and interactive elements to help illustrate the mathematical principles behind the paradox, emphasizing how human intuition often underestimates such probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analog of the birthday paradox that gets me all the time is what I think of as The Locker Room Paradox. This is where when I go into the locker room after working out and the guy who comes in behind me ends in the locker right next to mine. So there’s two of us in a big empty room awkwardly jostling away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the fact that it's using the previous user birthdays. Unfortunately today is my birthday and I think a lot of people are entering today's date as their birthday, I got 6 matches... :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit confused. Maybe i did not pay enough attention but... Does it stop the first simulation when there are _any_ 2 people with a same birthday, or when someone has _my_ birthday? I think the latter will take more people on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211188</guid></item><item><title>43.

The ball pythons were cramped together in a tiny enclosure with no enrichment, red light that bothers them, no cover or clutter, nothing to climb, no way to burrow, etc.Not exactly a test of whether they are 'social' and frankly it's cruel. Those animals are in so much stress that no data gathered is useful.Now, if you made a giant vivarium with plenty of space for each, things to climb, substrate to burrow in, etc, would they still choose to congregate? That would be a more interesting experiment. But unfortunately, the answer would most likely be 'no'.There definitely are some social snakes out there. Garter snakes, for example, are very well known to form colonies and do much better together than alone.But 'forcing' this conclusion for other species by putting snakes in this situation is awful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free link:https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/science/ball-pythons-soci...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42138313</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is aiming to block Google's proposed acquisition of Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup, citing concerns that the deal could stifle competition in the rapidly evolving AI sector. The department argues that the merger would consolidate Google's dominance and potentially hinder innovation, leading to a less competitive market. This action is part of a broader scrutiny of tech mergers and acquisitions, reflecting ongoing regulatory challenges that major tech companies face in maintaining their market positions while fostering competition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It really feels like they've got some weird vendetta against Google and are just trying to kill it. Which really sucks because Google is the only big tech company that I haven't had negative interactions with.  Using Apple and MS products feels like constant friction to try "force" me into their ecosystem.  Whereas with Google you can just use a product, have it work with any device, any OS, across devices and you're never forced into anything else.The DOJ also seems to be going way beyond their mandate in saying Google monopolizes search and ads.  If the Microsoft precedent is anything to go by, just require Android users to choose a browser and search engine, allow other ad companies to bid on showing ads on search results or something, that seems fair.But forcing them to sell Chrome, open proprietary algorithms to competitors and divest from business parnerships is way over the top and really, really feels like the government is doing a favour to Microsoft and Apple.  Maybe Google didn't cooperate enough on something classified?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This proposal seems like a powerful subsidy for Microsoft and OpenAI.  Why can they partner while Google and Anthropic can't?  It is strange to penalize a non-monopoly partnership like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;http://archive.today/Hm8f6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42210560</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Ontopia explores the concept of Topic Maps, a standard for knowledge representation that facilitates the organization and retrieval of information. It delves into the theoretical foundations of Topic Maps, including their structure, components, and practical applications in various fields such as information management and semantic web technologies. The text emphasizes the importance of organizing information in a way that is intuitive and useful for users, showcasing how Topic Maps provide a flexible framework for linking relevant concepts and enhancing information discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

It paid well though, and I could attend conferences around the world.As for the usefulness of the Topic Maps, Mind Maps and ontologies in general... they are useful instantly for the person who composes them as a way to organize thoughts. Pretty much what Notion, Evernote etc are doing, but with much less elegance.They are utterly useless as a way to share knowledge.Also, even 20 years ago, the field was full of old farts wasting everyone's time and consuming salaries. I doubt it changed for better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To this day, topic maps still provide me with my go-to (meta) model.Topic maps truly provide a straightforward organizational metaphor. The foundational topic maps concept —comprising topics, occurrences, and associations— achieves a balance between simplicity and clarity while offering sufficient structure. This allows you to effectively translate your mental model of a domain into a corresponding topic map representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211685</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;"Against the Dark Forest" explores the themes of personal struggle and resilience through the lens of a fantasy narrative. The story features a protagonist who confronts overwhelming darkness and adversity, symbolizing internal battles and the journey towards self-discovery. It delves into the importance of hope, courage, and the transformative power of facing one’s fears. The narrative is rich in imagery and metaphor, inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences with challenges and the light that can emerge from confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real talk. The disdain engineers have toward the "soft sciences"[sociology, psychology] enables them to manipulated into building systems which reproduce and reinforce social structures and social relations in ways that they would otherwise object to.To the degree that we've collectively built a dark forest, it's been in part due to this lack of multi-disciplinarianism.Humans are amazingly adept at rationalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI, bots, and the constant need to fuel training, turns the internet forest into a place where anything a person publishes will be vampirically consumed, mimicked to see whether it can replicate whatever value could be had, and capitalized on if possible or ignored if not.It’s an interesting contrast to actual dark forest theory—-AI doesn’t want to destroy us, so we don’t need to hide for existential sake. But imagine walking outside and as soon as you do, innumerable copies of you spring up, and each action and sound you make is replicated and amplified. Like a weird Phantom Tollbooth meets Alice in Wonderland on DMT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article attempts to bite off a lot! I'm going to condense it down to one small part.The Dark Forest experience that's causing "mass migrations" on the Internet is that, if you venture out into social media carelessly, you're entering an aggressive and frequently unpleasant space which is close to the opposite of "fun" for the average person. Here follows a laundry list here of things which you might expect to encounter in an unpleasant online space, most of which have a kind of tabloid quality: scams, nonstop sales pitches, porn, extreme violence, celebrity worship, ideological extremism, racism, sexism, etc. And more (that list is not exhaustive).So people find that signing up for the average generic platform that welcomes everybody is a bad experience, and migrate to more niche ones. That's been the path I've followed too, all the way here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42217484</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to have a pretty successful browser extension that I shut down because the site it worked on shut down.I grew it by adding features that people would ask for on the site's forums, for example a user would say "hey can we have x feature?" and I would respond saying "great idea, I added x feature to my extension y!" This was very effective and over time others would start responding saying my extension had whatever feature they were asking, capitalizing on how relatively slow companies are to implement features.This does rely on the extension having a site it operates on and having a forum for users though. If I were to do it today I'd focus on finding places where my extension's users concentrate, Discord, a community Slack, or otherwise, and doing the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I built 2 popular extensions:1. Notion Boost: 80K downloads with $10k in revenueI wrote about my whole journey here: https://gourav.io/blog/notion-boost2. ChatGPT Writer (https://chatgptwriter.ai) : 700K downloads with $20K MRRThis one I shared on reddit and it grew from there. I will write a post about it soon as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run Track &amp; Trace Tools[1], an extension directly targeted at the legal cannabis industry's main compliance platform Metrc.Since it's targeted at businesses and not consumers, word of mouth has been powerful for me. I've rapidly grown in the state of Michigan thanks to a few very enthusiastic operators.I also went on a slate of podcasts last year to talk about (read: promote) my product. Podcast hosts are always looking for guests, and most of them didn't cost me a thing.It's also been helpful to be a Google Developer Expert for web extensions, the Chrome team interviewed me and that gave me a platform to talk about what I was working on[2].[1] https://trackandtrace.tools[2] https://youtu.be/8P-Sc8ZaViY?si=tLhx3LMIlNqHBvfB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42217504</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Do they merely memorize training data and reread it out loud, or are they picking up the rules of English grammar and the syntax of C language?This is a false dichotomy. Functionally the reality is in the middle. They "memorize" training data in the sense that the loss curve is fit to these points but at test time they are asked to interpolate (and extrapolate) to new points. How well they generalize depends on how well an interpolation between training points works. If it reliably works then you could say that interpolation is a good approximation of some grammar rule, say. It's all about the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big thread at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34474043&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idk from when even id this article?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an AI Art Turing Test where participants were tasked with creating art pieces that could potentially fool viewers into believing they were created by humans. It emphasizes evaluating both the artwork's quality and the subjective opinions of the judges on whether they can distinguish between human and AI-generated art. The piece reflects on the implications of AI in creative fields, the nature of artistry, and how advancements in AI challenge traditional notions of artistic expression. Additionally, it includes discussions and reflections from participants about their experiences and outcomes from the test.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like the comment made by the author's friend captures a lot of my feelings on AI art. AI art is often extremely detailed, but that detail is often just random noise. It's art that becomes worse and makes less sense the more carefully you look at it.Compared that to human art. When a person makes a highly detailed artwork, that detail rewards looking closely. That detail forms a cohesive, intentional vision, and incentivizes the viewer to spend the time and effort to take it all in. A person could spend hours looking at Bruegel's Tower of Babel paintings, or Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights".Overall, I've never felt the need to spend the time looking closely at AI art, even AI art that I couldn't tell was AI right away. Instead of rewarding close inspection with more detail, AI art punishes the viewer who looks closer by giving them undecipherable mush.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can't really draw many conclusions from this test, since the AI art has already been filtered by Scott to be ones that Scott himself found confusing. So What do any of the numbers at the end of this really mean? "Am I better than Scott at discerning AI art from human" is about the only thing this test says.If you didn't filter the AI art first, people would do much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fine art is a matter of nuance, so in that sense I think it does matter that a lot of the "human art" examples are aggressively cropped (the Basquiat is outright cut in half) and reproduced at very low quality. That Cecily Brown piece, for example, is 15 feet across in person. Seeing it as a tiny jpg is of course not very impressive. The AI pieces, on the other hand, are native to that format, there's no detail to lose.But those details are part of what make the human art interesting to contemplate. I wouldn't even think of buying an art book with reproductions of such low quality--at that point you do lose what's essential about the art work, what makes it possible to enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42216694</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, there's a lot of gotchas in Bash like this. A lot of them are documented here: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls, including the `test -v` case, which is #61. Some more code execution pitfalls are documented here: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming/05?action=show&amp;r... including the `-eq` part (under Arithmetic Expansion).Basically, the -v case was by design, so for `-v 'hash[$key]'`, "$key is expanded before the array subscript evaluation, and then the whole array plus expanded index is evaluated in a second pass". "Newer versions of bash (5.0 and higher) have a assoc_expand_once option which will suppress the multiple evaluations"Note that the `-v` case doesn't really work the way one may infer from reading the OP:&gt;  $ key='$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)'&gt;  $ [[ -v 'x[$key]' ]]&gt;  bash: $(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned): syntax error: operand expected (error token is "$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)") *&gt;  [[ -v "${x[$key]}" ]]&gt;  bash: $(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned): syntax error: operand expected (error token is "$(cat /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/pwned)")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yuck, I was always instinctively put off by [[, now I finally have some arguments to justify it.IMO safe shell scripting is kind of dead. I can do it if I really have to, but too many external programs have tricky "convenience" features like interpreting flags after positional parameters, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many footguns in bash. When do we finally get serious about ditching this language as an industry in the same way we are about memory safety?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212700</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In software development it's pretty important to know when to build "on top" of something else, and when to start from scratch.Lots of developers will find it much more interesting, challenging, rewarding and just plain fun to develop something from scratch, even when there are better things that already exist.They'll cleverly manipulate and convince the boss, against the better discretion of their elder developers, that they can do it, and if they're one of the better developers, the boss won't want to risk losing them so they'll agree to the escapade.Then said escapade turns into a shambles, as predicted by the elder devs, and the developer who created the mess simply quits and moves to some other job, in search of more fun and greener pastures. Any developer with decades of experience has probably seen this same pattern multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen this a lot when someone wants to add "workflow automation" or "scripting" to their app. The most success I'd had is embedding either Lua or Javascript (preferably Lua) with objects/functions from the business domain available to the user's script. This is what games do too. I think it's a great way to dodge most of the work. For free you can support flow control, arbitrary boolean expressions, math, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;old-guy-high-school-glory-days-and-nobody-today&gt;Reminds me of the pain of intentionally building a compiler for Java 2 (subset)  to MIPS compiler by writing out each AST node class by hand. And, I did it twice, once in C++03 with bison and flex and again in Java 2 with CUP and JFlex... each was developed to build and run as a host portably across Solaris (sparc), Linux (x86), HP-UX (68k), SGI (MIPS), and Windows (x86) with compiled with targets run on the SPIM emulator. It did have dead code, dead string, and dead variable elimination, but that was as far my optimization passes went. I recall the only build tool I used for each was the portable subset of make without GNU extensions.Speaking of reinventing the wheel, in 1998, I built a flexible almost framework for a "portable" generic installer using Java 2, JWT (native GUI controls), and JNI on Windows to create a program group and desktop shortcut icon. The hilarious part was shipping a full JRE on a CD. It took forever to load but the additional time seemed impressive for  expensive, niche software in a way similar to the now fake "loading..." delayed progress bar.&lt;/old-guy-high-school-glory-days-and-nobody-today&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42186244</guid></item><item><title>3.

And the Javascript code interacted with the underlying XUL hacks in a manner not much different from WebOS palm used decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I enjoyed 4dwm when I had a sgi, I am not convinced the desktop environment was that great, it did however have a very nice file manager, which I guess is 90% of a desktop environment, so perhaps it was pretty good after all.The best sgi ui innovation, which unfortunately I rarely see anywhere else, was the use of drop pockets, these are drag and drop targets, small squares that are uniformly styled to give the user a hint that dropping something here is useful.I was unable to find a good example with multiple pockets, but for example: when you see that blue square in the file manager, you know you can drop something there and it will try to use it as a path.https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/user-experience-ux/pa...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used to be called 5DWM.Also CDE is now open source, being actively maintained, and is still the CDE you remember.

&lt;p&gt;The OpenMPTCPRouter is an open-source project designed to enhance Internet connectivity by utilizing Multipath TCP (MPTCP), which allows for the simultaneous use of multiple network interfaces. The platform aims to provide a robust, flexible solution for improving network performance and resilience, particularly in environments where reliable connectivity is crucial, such as in rural areas or during network outages. It features an easy-to-use web interface for configuration and management, supports various devices, and is geared toward both professional and hobbyist users interested in optimizing their network setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219890"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my last year of university (5 years ago) I took a networking seminar. Each student took a look at a different technology to utilize multiple links for internet data transfers.Initially I was amazed by MPTCP and wondered why it had so little adoption. As I looked into the papers I slowly figured out why. With different links (WLAN, LAN, LTE) their real world characteristics are too different for efficient aggregation. It is the head of line blocking problem times ten.It might be fine as a back up link, but there are other problems like the limit to TCP and middelboxes dropping unknowns packets.
The challenges outnumber the benefits for consumers and in data centers there are other technologies to aggregate links that operate on a level below TCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using this for around 6 months now to aggregate a 70 mbit FTTC connection and 150-450 mbit 5G connection; overall it works pretty well. The FTTC connection is the "master" link and it seems is preferred for the first several bytes of the connection, so the latency is better than using the 5G connection directly. This provides a nice balance for general web browsing, as loading web pages is still quite quick and overall download speed is more than either connection alone. In my setup I'd say it's about 80% efficient in terms of aggregating the total download.There are a lot of configuration options and the stability of them can be an issue. I've found using XRay VLESS for the Proxy and Glorytun TCP for VPN to offer the best overall speed and reliability. (Edit: I've disabled SQM too). It's possible to mostly bypass the VPN by enabling proxy UDP over XRay but I found that breaks various bypass rules, e.g. so that Netflix connections always go over 5G, as some content has restriction from being accessed by my VPS data center IP.Port forwarding is also a bit hit and miss; I have configured my 2 WAN routers to use the OMR router as a DMZ and then if I want to play a game, or enable remote access, I will use the bypass feature so that the device's MAC goes through my FTTC connection. UPnP works correctly in this scenario which is handy for consoles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used OpenMPTCPRouter to aggregate 3 LTE connections (via routers connected to directional antenna, with SIM cards from different operators) when I was living in a house in the woods before the war has started I had to leave Russia.
Worked like a charm, giving me up to 180 Mbps or so. May not be that good for aggregating different types of links together, but for using multiple cellular connections it's nearly a perfect solution.
BTW 5G 3GPP specs include MPTCP support, IIRC for aggregating connections going via different gNodeBs (base stations)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219890</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of using GPS technology in the historical context of the year 1565, examining the advancements in navigation and cartography during that period. It discusses how navigators relied on celestial navigation and rudimentary tools rather than modern GPS, highlighting the challenges they faced in exploring uncharted territories. The narrative emphasizes the importance of geographic knowledge and the evolution of navigational methods, showcasing how far technology has come since then and inviting readers to appreciate the historical developments leading to contemporary navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just want to jump in as a minority voice here. In case anybody is reading the other comments and feeling... alienated.I refuse to accept on-call duties, full stop. If a job posting expects it, I don't apply. If a hiring manager says they have it, I do not accept the offer. If management starts talking about maybe implementing it, I protest. If it becomes enacted, I resign.There is absolutely no situation in which I will ever participate in another on-call shift. I've been there, I've done it, now that chapter of my life is closed. Find some younger kid, pay them better than you paid me for the miserable intrusion on their life. I'm done.Just wanted to be the voice who says what, hopefully, some of the more seasoned and battle-scarred readers here are thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My team does Wednesday to Wednesday for many of the same reasons mentioned in the article, and it works great. We switch at 11am and hold a hand-off meeting at that time, and invite the whole team.Hand-off meetings with the whole team work really well (in my opinion!) when you have a relatively small team--we have 9 FT teammates. Often someone else may have been delegated the page or bug that arose and can discuss how they handled it, or someone who wasn't involved may have insight for how to handle a situation better the next time. Since we're all going to be on rotation at least once during a quarter, it's great to know what happened in case a similar page pops up later.Finally, we also fill out a running Doc before/during the meeting with links to the pages/bugs, along with short descriptions of how they were handled. This forms a great living memory of how to deal with incidents, and is also often the birthplace of new playbooks for handling new types of incidents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here in France, we have strict laws, and on-calls MUST be paid in some form or another. When we were bought by a US company, mgmt tried to set up on-call shifts for us - we had never needed them for the 10 years prior -, until they learnt of labor laws and went "fuck it, you're on call mon-fri, 10am - 6pm". I'm forty, have a family, and no amount of money could justify that I can't shutoff my phone at night, or prevent from going on a walk on weekends because "uptime". I've never been so glad of french worker protections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42189336</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FYI, the modern version of the intro networking book we (UC undergrad computer science) had 20 years ago is Computer Networks 6th ed. by Tanenbaum.If you want a programming language to really dig into parsing and creating packets and binary data, Erlang (and Elixir), while a completely different programming paradigm daunting to novice users, are unmatched (pun intended) in generating and parsing binary packets with a native and flexible binary data type.If you want to be able to observe, decode, and inspect real packets on your local network, then you need wireshark and/or tcpdump.If you want a home lab for simulating various networks with various clients, servers, and network devices either XenServer (free) or VMware ESXi (pirated "free" v.7 or maybe v.8) are good options because they simulate dumb virtual switches, virtual networks, and virtual computers (VMs) in another piece of software that replaces a real computer's (usually a server but rarely a desktop or laptop, but also it can run inside a VM on desktop, laptop, or server using what's called a type-2 hypervisor) operating system with its own (type-1 hypervisor). (VMware pre-Broadcom and Citrix engineering cultures had an unspoken, unwritten "gentleman's agreement" that industry-limited pirating was cool so long as it wasn't unreasonable, and product licensing wouldn't break customers' production and would be limited to nags. Comes from the mouth(s) of (a) certain former product manager(s) at one or more of the above entities. Pirating developer use for self-demoing within the industry was a nonzero, unrecognized sales acquisition channel that was probably important in large customer bases but under-appreciated... most engineers/IT people don't want to have to deal with vendor sales/sales engineering meeting free lunches and sit through vendor demos so see if a product trial will work or just to get an installer and a demo license key.)https://search.worldcat.org/title/1085945855PS: I'm wondering if there's retro networking/netadmin homelab community that buys 10 Mbps - 1 GbE Cisco gear and goes through CCIE courseware to see all the old protocols and old problems like spanning tree loops, crossover cables pre auto–MDI-X, and duplex flapping with Intel PRO/1000 in generation 8-9 HP and Dell servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top notch stuff, would love to see a nice explanation of the class based and classes IP addressing.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have successfully cloned two black-footed ferrets using frozen tissues, marking a significant advancement in conservation efforts for this endangered species. This achievement aims to bolster the ferret population, which has dwindled due to habitat loss and disease. The cloning process, which relies on state-of-the-art genetic techniques, offers hope for not only the black-footed ferret but also for other endangered species, illustrating the potential of biotechnology in wildlife conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the linked Washington Post story: "The cloned animals were made by injecting one of Willa’s cells into an egg from a domesticated ferret."Which is kind of interesting, because domesticated ferrets are a different species. (I wonder if this means the clones have mitochondrial DNA from the domesticated ferret egg.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious how many defects creep into the process. I doubt the scientists have any idea, and I'm pretty sure the process involves a great deal of statistical inference to reconstruct the genome from many, many small chunks of DNA.How would they even measure their accuracy? By definition, there's not even a baseline to measure against, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much genetic diversity do you really need?My limited (and likely wrong) understanding of Syrian hamsters is they're all descended from a few specimens someone collected a long time ago. Is there something special in hamsters that prevents genetic issues? Do they not have a lot of recessive characteristics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42173292</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the author is reading this, I think a single repository would be more appropriate than multiple repos [1]. It would be nice to set things up so we can simply git pull, docker run, and execute the benchmarks for each language sequentially.Something that stood out to me is the author’s conclusion that "Node.js wins." However, both the Node.js and C++ versions use the same library, uWebSockets! I suspect the actual takeaway is this:"uWebSockets wins, and the uWebSockets authors know their library well enough that even their JavaScript wrapper outperforms my own implementation in plain C++ using the same library!" :-pMakes me wonder if there’s something different that could be done in Go to achieve better performance. Alternatively, this may highlight which language/library makes it easier to do the right thing out of the box (for example, it seems easier to use uWebsockets in nodejs than in C++). TechEmpower controversies also come to mind, where "winning" implementations often don’t reflect how developers typically write code in a given language, framework, or library.--1: https://github.com/matttomasetti?tab=repositories&amp;q=websocke...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their explanation for why Go performs badly didn't make any sense to me. I'm not sure if they don't understand how goroutines work, if I don't understand how goroutines work or if I just don't understand their explanation.Also, in the end, they didn't use the JSON payload. It would have been interesting if they had just written a static string. I'm curious how much of this is really measuring JSON [de]serialization performance.Finally, it's worth pointing out that WebSocket is a standard. It's possible that some of these implementations follow the standard better than others. For example, WebSocket requires that a text message be valid UTF8. Personally, I think that's a dumb requirement (and in my own websocket server implementation for Zig, I don't enforce this - if the application wants to, it can). But it's completely possible that some implementations enforce this and others don't, and that (along with every other check) could make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting that https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js (which is C++ with node bindings) outperforms the raw C++ uWebSockets implementation.It's also interesting that https://github.com/websockets/ws does not appear in this study, given that in the node ecosystem it is ~3x more likely to be used (not a perfect measurement but ws has 28k github stars vs uWebSockets 8k stars)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219024</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have uncovered an ancient alphabet in Syria, dating back to around 2,800 years ago. This significant finding highlights the script's potential relation to early alphabets used in the region, offering insights into the development of writing systems. The discovery is expected to provide a better understanding of the historical and cultural context of early civilizations in the area, revealing how language evolved in relation to societal changes. The researchers emphasize the importance of the find in tracing the origins of alphabets used in the broader Near Eastern area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the advantages of using threads over async/await for concurrent programming in Python. It highlights how threads can simplify context management and improve execution, especially in I/O-bound applications, while async/await can introduce complexity and potential pitfalls. The author provides examples and comparisons to demonstrate the efficiency of threads, particularly in scenarios where latency is a concern, suggesting that threads may be a more straightforward solution for many use cases involving concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article seems specific to JavaScript, C# is different.&gt; you cannot await in a sync functionIn C# it’s easy to block the current thread waiting for an async task to complete, see Task.Wait method.&gt; since it will never resolve, you can also never await itIn C#, awaiting for things which never complete is not that bad, the standard library has Task.WhenAny() method for that.&gt; let's talk about C#. Here the origin story is once again entirely differentOriginally, NT kernel was designed for SMP from the ground up, supports asynchronous operations on handles like files and sockets, and since NT 3.5 the kernel includes support for thread pool to dispatch IO completions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_completion_portOverlapped I/O and especially IOCP are hard to use directly. When Microsoft designed initial version of .NET, they implemented thread pool and IOCP inside the runtime, and exposed higher-level APIs to use them. Stuff like Stream.BeginRead / Stream.EndRead available since .NET 1.1 in 2003, the design pattern is called Asynchronous Programming Model (APM).Async/await language feature introduced in .NET 4.5 in 2012 is a thin layer of sugar on top of these begin/end asynchronous APIs which were always there. BTW, if you have a pair of begin/end methods, converting into async/await takes 1 line of code, see TaskFactory.FromAsync.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually think out of any language async/await makes the most sense for javascript.In the first example: there is no such thing as a blocking sleep in javascript. What people use as sleep is just a promise wrapper around a setTimeout call. setTimeout has always created microtasks, so calling a sleep inline would do nothing to halt execution.I do agree that dangling Promises are annoying and Promise.race is especially bad as it doesn't do what you expect: finish the fastest promise and cancel the other. It will actually eventually resolve both but you will only get one result.Realistically in JS you write your long running async functions to take an AbortController wrapper that also provides a sleep function, then in your outer loop you check the signal isn't aborted and the wrapper class also handles calling clearTimeout on wrapped sleep functions to stop sleeping/pending setTimeouts and exit your loop/function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has only written serious applications in single-threaded, or manually threaded C/C++, and concurrent applications in go using goroutines, channels, and all that fun stuff, I always find the discussion around async/await fascinating. Especially since it seems to be so ubiquitous in modern programming, outside of my sphere.But one thing is: I don't get it. Why can't I await in a normal function? await sounds blocking. If async functions return promises, why can't I launch multiple async functions, then await on each of them, in a non-async function that does not return a promise?I get there are answers to my questions. I get await means "yeald if not ready" and if the function is not async "yeald" is meaningless. But I find it a very strange way of thinking nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171693</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the article would discuss physics of flight, but it's about physics of iridescence. Cool, but not what I expected.  I've seen butterflies fly in a stiff wind. It seems impossible even when you watch it. I was hoping for some insight into that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most beautiful flying creature imo, they fly almost effortlessly.
I often work remotely in the nature, standing hours in front of my laptop, and sometimes a butterfly or a dragonfly lands on my arm or shoulder, and stays a while. When you think about it, it's probably the safest place for them, since their predators (lizards, ..) don't come close to humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The interior of my 3d printed parts has that exact gyroid pattern by the way. They put that in SuperSlicer, and presumably in PrusaSlicer, because it is really easy to print by running wiggly lines along x and y direction. Works great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183079</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was following this discussion on the /r/chipdesign subreddit when Ken posted there a few days ago.  Nice to see that he gave credit and linked to that thread.I'm a physical design engineer that uses software from Cadence and Synopsys to do chip layout of blocks with billions of standard cells.  Our flow automatically puts antenna diodes in for all block input pins.  Then the tools are usually good enough to breakup internal nets with layer jumping to avoid antennas.Some of the charge also comes from the CMP process.  Modern chips have about 20 layers of metal but there are lots of other via layers in between those and then all the base layers with the actual transistors.  You want the wafer to be flat before building the next layer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical-mechanical_polishing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here: I know this is a very obscure topic, but hopefully it will be interesting to some. Let me know if there are any questions...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fun fact about "antennas" in chip manufacturing: They have nothing to do with actual antennas. Charge can build up on long wires during manufacturing because the chemicals involved are not neutral and have some interactions with exposed wires. That charge needs to go somewhere to protect the rest of the circuits. There's nothing RF about this.Later technologies (28 nm and below) have extensive design rules around prevention of "antenna" effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42223690</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent decision by the University of Oxford to offer contracts to Deliveroo riders to provide tutorial services, highlighting the implications of this move within the gig economy. It raises concerns about the potential undermining of traditional academic staffing structures and the quality of education, as it blurs the lines between full-time academic staff and gig workers. The piece critiques the commercialization of education and the ethical considerations of employing gig economy workers in an academic setting, suggesting that such practices could impact both students and the integrity of educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All UK universities do this. Not necessarily a bad thing unlike how the article portrays it. PhD students (and depending on the institution, postdocs) in the UK get a stipend that has no mandated teaching hours. Teaching allows PhD students to earn some extra income within the university.We certainly still have a compensation problem in academia. Bright STEM PhD grads don't want to earn £30-40k as a postdoc when earning £150k+ in big tech or finance isn't unusual. However, PhD students earning a little side income by marking lab reports or programming assessments isn't necessarily bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is this news? this sounds like every university in the US, which uses underpaid adjuncts to do most of the teaching and underpaid phd candidates and postdocs to do most of the researchnot saying this is right -- adjuncts and postdocs absolutely need to be paid more commensurately with the value they provide -- but it has been the status quo for a long time; the bigger problem is that it used to be a temporary stepping stone to professorship, whereas now universities are perpetually and increasingly relying on this cheap labor to cut costs, making the path for academia an increasingly tortuous one. It's highly counter productive because who wants to go through all that instead if you can get a job in industry that values you much more? The result is that you don't get the best and brightest educating the next generation, except maybe at a few universities - Oxford, Stanford, Harvard, MIT, etc. - where the prestige itself is enough of a draw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems that these days academia is mostly garbage for anyone who wants things like money, family or a healthy work-life balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42163330</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve worked on and finished some extremely large programs over my years in non-tech enterprise. I’m also an external examiner for CS students, and I’ve regularly talked about how I think the curriculum is outdated. In Denmark where I’m from it’s rare to get a programming application from someone without a related degree. It wasn’t so rare 20 years ago, but I can’t remember when I saw one last. I agree that degrees, and especially CS, doesn’t guarantee that people can code. We use them mostly as a “safety net” in our hiring processes here in my region of the world. Basically you can view hiring the wrong person as the most expensive mistake you can make as a manager, and educations are a sort of risk management. You might think that the “can this person actually program” risk is worst for people who are fresh out of their education but there are a lot of factors which can play into it. Older devs may be set in their ways, maybe even religious about some sort of programming philosophy. On the flip side they will start producing value right away.Anyway, by far I think the biggest hurdle in our industry right now is pseudo-jobbers like project managers, business process owners, scrum masters, various architects and what not. Not everyone is a waste of time, some of them do excellent work and function as exponential productivity catalysts. The vast majority of them, however, spend so much time engineering the process, architecture, whatever that their teams never ship on time or within budget. In this sense I think “correct programs” is hard to value. Because often the “incorrect large program” that doesn’t scale, will be much more valuable for a business than a “correct program” which never even gets the chance because it took to long to get out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me strongly of reaching the final year industry projects in my software engineering degree, and seeing a significant portion of my colleagues unable to develop software in any meaningful way.There was a curriculum correction in the years afterwards I think, but so many students had zero concept of version control, of how to start working on a piece of software (sans an assignment specification or scaffold), or how to learn and apply libraries or frameworks in general. It was unreal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was a prof (many years ago), I was working on a database for a political campaign. The code was a mess. I asked a couple of my colleagues (successful comp. sci. profs) to help out. It became clear very quickly that there are two kinds of comp. sci. profs: those who can program and those who cannot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171685</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides guidance on how to effectively give feedback to senior leaders while minimizing the risk of negative repercussions. It emphasizes the importance of preparing for the conversation by considering the leader's perspective, using a constructive and respectful tone, and focusing on specific behaviors rather than personal attributes. The piece also outlines techniques for fostering a productive dialogue, such as choosing the right time and place, framing feedback as a conversation about improvement, and being receptive to the leader’s responses.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Astonishing. Completely backwards. This article describes how to give feedback to your subordinates, not to your superiors. If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it's feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don't bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don't yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.The reason you don't fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience one of the best ways to "get ahead" is to give direct 1:1 feedback to someone higher up in your management chain for something that you are obviously right about it (some wiggle room here, but be sure to be atleast mostly right on a non-trivial topic). It demonstrates to them that you have good judgement and have backbone. They will trust you more and start to think of you as more of a peer than merely someone in their span of control (obviously you need to do this tactfully / not be a dick about it but also be firm). This has been a huge unlock for my career. ymmv.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Captain Miller: "I don't gripe to you, Reiben. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The linked website for Yotta is withyotta.com which looks like some sort of online gambling site? The slogan is "Play games. Win Big." Am I missing something? It doesn't look like something I'd trust to put any amount of money into.Looking at archive.org for September 2023 [1] they claim an "average annual savings reward" of "~2.70%*". At a real major US bank, I was getting 4.65% in my savings account at this same time.Reading the terms at the bottom of the page it says: "Please note that the approximate Average Annual Savings Reward of 2.70% is a statistical estimate based on the probabilities of matching numbers each night. The Annual Savings Reward will vary from member to member depending on one’s luck in the Daily Drawings and is subject to change in the future."[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20230912164609/https://www.withy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did I get this right:1) non-bank fintech put client's money in the bank2) they told clients that money in the bank are covered by FDIC which is technically true3) fintech moved money out of the bank4) bank insurance doesn't apply because the bank didn't "lose" anythingAt least this seems to match the Evolve's part of the story from the article. And Evolve is a real bank so they should have all the records to prove it. If so then it's a clear fraud by fintechs, but FDIC can't do much. Otherwise Evolve is lying and in this case FDIC can take over.I wonder what is a reliable way to know if in the end your money is covered or not. Trusting what the contract tells you is evidently not enough. Having a "real" individual account number in a real bank? Not sure either, if intermediary can move the money out of your personal account then account insurance likely won't work either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems like obviously fraud on the part of Synapse/Yotta. Where else could the money have gone? There were no risky investments. The underlying bank didn't collapse. Why isn't there a federal prosecutor on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219407</guid></item><item><title>24.

Just as well it's Sunday tomorrow.[0] https://www.sigbovik.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like this. It’s an opportunity for unpopular science to shed light on things we might not otherwise talk about.
The research on blue zones is all fraud or records error.
Ducks are rapacious little fuckers.
This topics are not pleasant, but they’re real science. Our understanding gets advanced, errors in thinking get corrected.Science is one of the rare structure of knowledge which includes self correction by default. But correction and reputation don’t play nicely together. For correction to occur somebody had to be wrong. In some cases a lot of people.Having a prize like this lets us elevate previously embarrassing findings, take the whole thing less seriously and make room for ideas outside the status quo.I’m not sure this prize is any less important than the Nobel prize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to be confused with the Golden Fleece Award (for which they prize money is disbursed beforehand)https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece_Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182701</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing. I liked the short video.These have been around for a few years. Wonder what people built with them since. Anyone know of any popular distributed systems using them nowadays? (I noticed the company the author mentioned shut down https://medium.com/@MeetLima/this-time-its-goodbye-5573a97be...)As an additional resource I liked the description of ITC by Fred Hebert: https://ferd.ca/interval-tree-clocks.html. He is the author of the wonderful Learn You Some Erlang book. There is an ITC library he maintains as well: https://github.com/ferd/interval-tree-clocks, started by Paulo Sergio Almeida.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several things remain unclear:"The beauty of this scheme is that a node only has to know about its share of the interval"The article doesn't explain curve changes in much detail, but I assume it increases the portion of the curve "owned" by the node.With unique identifiers all a node needs to know its identifier. So that can't be what's interesting about these interval portions.Also:- How that curve is initially drawn isn't clear at all. Is it flat and becomes complex over time by forking (+ data modification)?- Why are interval boundaries real-value in a system that cannot actually express real numbers?- How are the intervals / portions decided? Is that simpler than generating UUIDs?- How does comparison work?"Comparison works similarly to Version Vectors: if the curve of a stamp is above the other one, it descends it, otherwise the curves intersect and the stamps are concurrent."But now you have events with curves and intervals where one event might miss a portion. It's not immediately clear what happens in that comparison. It's maybe obvious to some readers but clearly not an audience that needed introduction for the other things initially explained by the article.In terms of conclusions:My understanding is that the main benefit is that the overall complexity of the "vector" becomes simpler in light of actor explosion due to the merging mechanism. Whereas UUIDs (or even monotonous index indexed vectors) would grow indefinitely, making tracking them on events a challenge.This intro article fails to make this stuff clear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interval tree clocks seem really cool, and I’d love to use them for something. But unfortunately I can’t think of a way to reliably have a system automatically subdivide an interval to bring new servers up without getting pathological behaviour sometimes. Or, if an identifier (interval) goes offline indefinitely, I can’t think of any good way to clear it.In practice, vector clocks / version vectors built using uuid identifiers for machines seem easier to work with, and they’re very predictable. Slightly less efficient - but versions take up a tiny percentage of network traffic and disk space that I don’t think it matters.I really want to use interval tree clocks for something. It’s such a cool algorithm. But I don’t know what I’d use them for - beyond maybe a set of manually provisioned servers syncing data or something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212543</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is from the SQLite creator D. Richard Hipp who is always worth reading, but, I'd like to recommend reading what TCL's creator John Ousterhout has to say.His article on threads from 1995 was highly influential on me, and I remember it to this day. More recently (2018, revised and expanded in 2021), he published a book on software engineering practices called A Philosophy of Software Design which is, in my opinion, the best in its category.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic TCL principal that "everything is a string". Beginning with SQLite3 (2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.TCL can handle binary data. It is just not a separate type: https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Working+with+binary+dataSQLite also always had a null type, surely?&gt; However, types are still very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL. SQLite treats the datatypes on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than hard requirementsThis is something I do not much like. Its not compulsory (you can create "strict" tables). It works well in TCL which is an entire language designed around the idea. Less so in SQL.One of the advantages of RDBMSes is that not accepting obviously wrong data makes life easier for developers. You can debug an issue that happens on inserting the data, not when you find the wrong type or other bad much later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day, the Tcl conferences (and the EuroTcl in Europe) were great sources of information. Only about half of the presentations were for Tcl internals and extensions. The rest were about other projects that were using Tcl in some way or other, and it was fascinating to learn about completely different areas of software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220078</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of runtime extensible parsers in DuckDB, a database management system. It highlights the flexibility of enabling users to create and integrate custom parsing functions directly into the database’s query handling process. This capability enhances the system’s ability to process various data formats dynamically, providing more efficient and tailored solutions for data ingestion. The authors also illustrate the technical approaches taken to develop this feature, emphasizing its potential benefits for users dealing with diverse data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From a practical standpoint, for anyone who needs to parse SQL today, I can recommend datafusion's sqlparser-rs. This is what we use in http://sql-page.com , and I regularly contribute to it. I don't know anything else that matches its level of support for all the crazy little-known syntax particularities of the various SQL dialects.In particular, Microsoft SQL Server seems to do everything just a little bit differently, and sqlparser-rs does support its idiosyncrasies most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The incredible Janet for Mortals book by Ian Henry was my first exposure to peg. It's very interesting and changed my thinking on programming in a big way. It's a free book.https://janet.guide/pegular-expressions/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is nothing wrong with using PEGs for SQL parsing, but this article (I didn't read the paper) presents flawed arguments:- tech $X is from the 60s, therefore it is bad and/or outdated: one doesn't need to "disrupt" or innovate in everything to become modern.  There are plenty of things from the 60s that still don't have a better replacement, and its OK to keep using it.- "YACC-style parsers" clumps together parsers that are generated at compile-time, from declarative grammars, using LALR(1).  But that's not inherit to the technique or algorithm: a parser can be LALR(1) from a declarative grammar and still extensible at run-time, or provide LL(1) alongside, or be built from statements instead of a grammar.  There's nothing wrong with using PEGs over "YACC-style" parsers, but not for these distorted reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213639</guid></item><item><title>29.

(2011)&gt; FDA announced that Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc, will voluntarily suspend sale of the animal drug 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) in response to a new FDA study of 100 broiler chickens that detected inorganic arsenic, a known carcinogen, at higher levels in the livers of chickens treated with the drug 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) than in untreated chickens. FDA officials stress that the levels of inorganic arsenic detected were very low and that continuing to eat chicken as 3-Nitro is suspended from the market does not pose a health risk.&gt; 3-Nitro® (Roxarsone) is an arsenic-based animal drug, manufactured by Alpharma LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. It is approved to help prevent coccidiosis when used in combination with certain animal drugs. Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease that infects the intestinal tracts in poultry and can lead to death in poultry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US owes it to the Vietnamese people to clean up the arsenic, but of course they're never going to do that. I know several elderly Vietnamese who developed leukemia after serving in the war.If you eat rice, please eat white not brown, parboil it with a ratio of 4:1 water to rice, and dump the water afterwards [0].https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The bottom line is that arsenic is a heavy metal, like lead, and all

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being optimistic and positive on tech in the first place is the root issue here. This reminds me of my mom in medical school who became disillusioned when she experienced the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and it's influence of the entire industry for it's own profit, not always in the interest of the patient.  Being overly optimistic about an industry or field is in my view a worldview error, and a better approach is to be optimistic about one's own potential to contribute to the betterment of humanity, no matter the field.  Also the understanding that there are and always will be bad actors should not dissuade one from being part of creating solutions, as one sees it. Being jaded and cynical will not help in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology is still a good thing.  It's certain tech business models that are the problem.Tech used to be a tool.  I remember participating in product design conversations in the '00s, and the focus was all on "How can we make people's lives better?  How do we create software that makes things more convenient for them, more enjoyable, frees up time and opens up new opportunities for them."Tech is now a means to turn people into tools.  I still sit in product design conversations.  Now they are focused on how to manipulate people into clicking on more ads and opening up their wallet more.  The applied psychology is very advanced, and is more of a focus than the technology now.IMHO, the root cause of this is the advertising + subscription business model, along with the provision of free products to get people hooked and then upsell them on expensive and (in the big picture, but customers can't see the big picture) insconsequential upgrades.  The secret to success in the tech industry is "Demonstrate value.  Nurture dependence.  Threaten to take away features, unless large amounts of money are paid."  In people terms, we call this an abusive relationship, or blackmail.  In the tech industry, it's a very profitable business model.The worst part is this is spreading to other industries like food production and transportation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's worth recalling why that optimism, at least in part.Information wanted to be free, for the first decade of the web's existence. Projects like Linux, Wikipedia, the www itself. These open, free ways of doing things were proving a case for optimism.They were so much faster &amp; better than corporate alternatives that you couldn't help but expecting that open projects had the competitive advantage.Meanwhile, online culture was very different. There was room for morons and blowhards, touts, spammers and occasional shill... but those people didn't run the show.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221937</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quit my FAANG job yesterday to join a fully remote company. I took a &gt;50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I've cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don't hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal.Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, "If you don't like it, find another place to work". The first good advice I've heard from them in 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have heard every possible sentiment about RTO at this point. The post is a well-written spleen vent, and I mostly agree, but I didn’t see anything new in it.But because everyone has an opinion, I’ll share mine:  I like being in the office, sometimes. I hate going to and from the office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s what I view as a common misperception embedded in the article. RTO isn’t about empty real estate, or not mostly. Leases can be broken, everything is subject to negotiation. Sure, there’s a cost, but it could be paid.It’s not about real estate, it’s about power. For a brief period, during the great resignation, executives felt the sting of at will employment, a weapon that was never meant to be used against them. RTO is about showing us all who is really in charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221623</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Japan's recent decision to start releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, which has sparked concerns and backlash from local fishermen and neighboring countries. The government asserts that the water is safe after treatment, but many remain skeptical about the environmental and health impacts. The release is part of a larger effort to manage the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster, but the controversy over safety measures and communication remains a significant issue in public discourse and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a novel method for enhancing the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms by employing a strategy called "distributional reinforcement learning." It introduces a new framework that focuses on modeling the entire distribution of returns, rather than just the expected value, which allows for better decision-making under uncertainty. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, showing improvements in learning efficiency and performance across several benchmark tasks. The findings suggest that considering the distribution of returns can lead to more robust and flexible reinforcement learning agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a concept known as the "simple semi-space collector," a technique used in garbage collection within programming languages. It examines the efficiency of this approach in managing memory by collecting objects that are no longer in use while minimizing the overhead typically associated with garbage collection processes. The author outlines the theoretical foundations of the semi-space collection method, its implementation, and its advantages in preserving performance in applications that require dynamic memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you like reading about GC implementation than keep reading wingo's blog. He's currently being funded by NLnet to finish the Whippet GC library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wingolog blog posts are always such a joy to read (for me at least). The combination of low-level fundamental stuff presented in a simple and accessible way that gets the core idea across is a rare quality.An immediate question I have is whether one could extend compacting GCs to also "sort" or "cluster" the live objects for better cache access in some way (in a practical sense I mean, where the extra runtime overhead is worth it). Also what kind clustering would actually work in that case.I'm guessing naively tracking how often each object is accessed in a certain window of time and sorting by that wouldn't work, since the most accessed objects could be used at completely different times - some sort of "accessed together" algorithm probably makes more sense. But then we're in the territory of a combinatorial explosion of options if we're not careful.Maybe something really stupid would work:    1. use a single global integer
       that increases by one with
       each heap memory access,
    2. assign the counter's value to
       GC metadata of the accessed
       object in question as a sort
       of "time stamp"
    3. during compacting, "sort"
       all living objects by whatever
       they have as their value
       (this is probably really hard)
    4. after compacting, reset counter
       and time stamps

Worst case this would put objects right next to at least two objects that were accessed around the same time.I presume that this question must have been researched to death, does anyone have any suggestions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This approach makes sense if you have access to either all available memory or a fixed quantity of memory, half of which would go to the fromspace and the other half to the tospace. What I don't understand is: When should the heap be made bigger? What about smaller?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42218941</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article reflects on the evolution of blogging over the decades, discussing its beginnings in the late 1990s, the rise of various platforms, and how blogging has transformed communication and content creation in the digital age. It highlights the shifting motivations behind blogging, from personal expression to professional networking, and examines the impact of social media on traditional blogging practices. The author shares insights into the future of blogging and its ongoing relevance in an ever-changing online landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article describes the author's walk through various companies (Sun, Joyent, Oxide) and how his blogging evolved with (and thanks to!) them. Not quite what I expected, particularly the points about how Sun truly encouraged blogging, so it was interesting in that regard. The many links to older articles help paint a good picture of this story.As for "conclusions"... I also hit the 2-decade mark earlier this year (https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/20-years-of-blogging) and I can spot similar thoughts to mine: blogging has evolved from short/informal posts to longer-form more structured pieces, and the smaller "throw-away" articles that one would write in the past now happen in other platforms like Twitter or Reddit. Which matches... the trend for everyone else too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you blog, do you go back and look at old pieces?I do that occasionally, mostly to reshare on social media or here. Gotta chase those karma points.But sometimes someone will ask a question in slack or via email that reminds me "I wrote something about that once!" and I'll dig up a piece to share.As a gift for a family member who had a non-technical blog, I once gathered posts together, edited them, and turned them into a book. That was a ton of fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article! I am about to reach the five-year mark of blogging (https://pncnmnp.github.io/blog.html) - I started during my second year as an undergraduate. Over the years, I've seen that:* Keeping the blogging stack minimal helps. Using simple tools has helped me focus entirely on the content. For instance, I write everything in Google Docs and then manually convert it to HTML.* It is beyond okay to feel stuck, especially with technical content. I often have several partially written drafts sitting around. Revisiting these drafts periodically helps me see them with fresh perspectives. Eventually, inspiration strikes, and I end up finishing those half-baked drafts.* It helps to avoid obsessing over analytics. I have intentionally avoided analytics, and it has kinda allowed me to focus on topics that genuinely interest me, rather than writing solely to please some imaginary audience. It kind of gives me the freedom to explore obscure subjects, even if they appeal to only a small number of my readers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42172034</guid></item><item><title>37. 9elements Takes over Intel 1st Gen Xeon Scalable Skylake Support Within Coreboot</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/9elements-SkylakeX-Coreboot</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an utterly brilliant hack for dimensionality reduction leading to pattern recognition. That it even beats SVMs (albeit with a single carefully chosen example ;-) is icing on the cake.One thing I don't understand is the addition of the constant 3 to the row index (in the paper just after formula 6). Intuitively this should be only 2, because the last row vector of the local topology lags the last state captured in the distance matrix by one row, and then we want to move ahead one more row to start forecasting.What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;naive question but can forecasting in a time series be applied backward to interpolate it?  in a case like this FReT algorithm, the idea would be that the information in the FReT interpolated series (or SETAR, NNET, etc) would have a higher fidelity to the total information in the sequence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, am I missing something?  "Topology" here just seems to mean connectivity, and I can't even tell why they have a notion of 3x3 connectivity-matrix structure.  A whole lot of this seems under-explained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42222431</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of energy being frame-dependent, illustrating how the measurement of energy can vary depending on the observer's frame of reference, particularly in the context of physics and relativity. It explains that different observers may perceive the same physical scenario differently based on their relative motion and position, leading to varying interpretations of energy. This highlights the importance of understanding the relativity of measurements and perceptions in scientific analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Most likely, the kid had some other upper respiratory tract infection with the symptoms coming from that and the H5 may well have been an incidental finding, especially since they have likely already recovered based on the timeframe I'm aware of. One potential theory is exposure to wild bird droppings.

A license for a 3D modeling package like Softimage or Alias cost at least $10-15k, and you probably also needed a separate raytracing package for high-quality output.Someone is selling a copy of Alias for SGI for $2500 on eBay today:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/335622694059But if, in 1994, you did have an SGI and Alias and enough artistic skill and technical competence (and patience…) to produce liquid logos and dancing soda bottles and face morphs, you would certainly recoup that $80k investment quickly. It was a very rare skill that needed very rare hardware. You could get highly paid freelance work by simply calling up ad agencies.That scarcity a bit hard to imagine today, when anyone can download Blender onto their standard desktop computer and learn it by watching online videos. It’s cool that 3D art has been thoroughly democratized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I miss from that era of machines was just the way they looked: at the time, most machines were grey or black boxes, but the SGIs had some degree of personality to them.  The O2's were fun little curvy boxes.  One of my favorites were the large rack systems - one of my jobs had us working with the Origin 2000 and PowerChallenge machines.  Compared to some of the generic clusters of rack mounted Alpha systems that we had around the same time, the SGIs just had a cool look to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This brings back memories. Back around the same time in the mid-90’s I remember visiting a post-production company, who had multiple SGI Onyx supercomputers in their stylish glass walled server room, dedicated to processing special effects for film and advertising.They were so expensive they only made sense to run 24/7/365 in order to get their money’s worth. They had a service engineer on call permanently who wasn’t allowed to be further away than 25 miles from the servers at any time.http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/onyxgs.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219411</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;A court ruled that a school acted appropriately when it punished a student for using AI tools in a manner deemed inappropriate. The ruling emphasized the school's responsibility to uphold its policies regarding academic integrity and student conduct, stating that the student was aware of these policies when deciding to use the AI. This decision highlights ongoing debates about the role of technology in education and the boundaries of acceptable use of AI by students.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The parents' case hangs largely on the student handbook's lack of a specific statement about AI, even though that same handbook bans unauthorized use of technology. "They told us our son cheated on a paper, which is not what happened," Jennifer Harris told WCVB last month. "They basically punished him for a rule that doesn't exist."I'm going out on a limb here, but if this is the viewpoint of the people who raised him, then I'm not surprised he cheated.If this was my son and the facts were the same, he'd be grounded in addition to whatever consequence the school deems fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The student was not punished for "using AI", but for plagiarism:&gt;The incident occurred in December 2023 when RNH was a junior. The school determined that RNH and another student "had cheated on an AP US History project by attempting to pass off, as their own work, material that they had taken from a generative artificial intelligence ('AI') application," Levenson wrote. "Although students were permitted to use AI to brainstorm topics and identify sources, in this instance the students had indiscriminately copied and pasted text from the AI application, including citations to nonexistent books (i.e., AI hallucinations)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably unpopular opinion here but families, usually wealthy, that use the legal system like this to avoid consequences are parasites. It reveals not only your poor job of raising your children. But also the poor character of the parents.Glad the courts didn’t grant a similar “affluenza” ruling here. The student plagiarized, short and simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42221688</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing trend of "quiet quitting," where employees fulfill only their basic job responsibilities without going above and beyond. This phenomenon reflects a growing desire for work-life balance, driven by factors such as burnout and changing workplace dynamics post-pandemic. The piece explores the implications for employers and employees, indicating that while it may lead to improved employee satisfaction, it could also undermine productivity and long-term career growth. The article emphasizes the need for better communication and understanding between workers and employers to foster a healthier workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rick Dickinson, the Sinclair designer guy, was simply a genius. It helped a lot for the success, the ZX81 and the Spectrum being just beautiful objects.On a side note, I think one of the most iconic manual cover for a computer is the ZX81 one. Designed by John Harris, it's a masterpiece. I think he designed the Spectrum manual too but it was not so great.We had beautiful computers at the time. I would say, in order of appearance, the Atari VCS, the ZX81, the Spectrum, the Commodore C128 and the Amiga 500 (inspired by the C128), the Apple IIc Plus. The original Macintosh eventually. It was just like having a piece of art at home.The Spectrum Next, still designed by Rick, is beautiful too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sinclair devices were popular because they were dirt cheap. A BBC micro was three times the price of a Spectrum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting how one generation basically had the same experience at the same time, but how it varied from place to place.The UK was very into ZX - first the ZX80 and ZX81, and then the Spectrum. For that generation, in the UK, Spectrum is the start of everything.I was an Apple child myself (a function of the machine my dad brought home), a BBC Micro at school (because... education), but in the mid 80s the Apple switched to IBM, and I've been on the PC track ever since.I've met other groups for whom Vic 20, Commodore 64 and especially Amiga hold that first-love status. I'm just blessed to be that generation where the hardware was there at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220062</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a black hole consuming material at an extraordinary rate, 40 times higher than previously thought possible. This finding challenges existing theories about black hole activity and growth, suggesting that these cosmic giants can feed much more aggressively than expected. The study offers new insights into the behaviors of black holes and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution, prompting a reevaluation of our understanding of their feeding mechanisms and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

No singularity at the center of a black hole2. Universe's expansion rate is not constant because it's blackholes powering it with matter3. Eventually expansion slows, stops and reversesAnd now my own crazy ideas:1. Maybe the universe is a inside a black hole2. Maybe the big bang was a result of the birth of another black hole somewhere else, and that the rapid expansion rate of the early universe was due to the a huge amount of matter converted into dark energy by this black hole&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think once we finally get this all sorted out, future humans will find it hilarious that so many people were convinced that dark matter was real and particles we could not detect made up 80% of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220777</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses print debugging as a simple yet effective technique for troubleshooting and understanding code behavior. It explains the advantages of using print statements to reveal the flow of execution and variable values, making it accessible even for novice programmers. The author highlights best practices for implementing print debugging, such as using meaningful messages and strategically placing statements, while also acknowledging its limitations compared to more advanced debugging tools. Ultimately, the post emphasizes print debugging's value in the development process, particularly for quick problem-solving and gaining insights into complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While print-type debugging has a place, the reason there are a lot of articles dissuading the practice is the observed reality that people who lean on print debugging often have incomplete knowledge of the immense power of modern debugging tools.This isn't just an assumption I'm making: years of being in developer leadership roles, and then watching a couple of my own sons learning the practice, has shown me in hundreds of cases that if print-type debugging is seen, a session demonstrating how to use the debugger to its fullest will be a very rewarding effort. Even experienced developers from great CS programs sometimes are shocked to see what a debugger can do.Walk the call stack! See the parameters and values, add watches, set conditional breakpoints to catch that infrequent situation? What! It remains eye opening again and again for people.Not far behind is finding a peer trying to eyeball complexity to optimize, to show them the magic of profilers...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the trickiest bugs to hung down are those involving concurrency and non-deterministic timing.  In these cases, stepping through a debugger is not at all what you want, since you may actually change the timing just by trying to observe.To see the nature of the race condition, just put some print statements in some strategic locations and then see the interleaving, out of order, duplicate invocations etc that are causing the trouble.  It's hard to see this type of stuff with a debugger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with all these 'print debugging is good' and 'print debugging articles are bad' is that none of them provide any context. Print debugging is just one tool in a box full of tools. Pick the right one for the right job. An article that walks through how to make that decision would be very useful. An article that just picks a side in a decades-old debate is just noise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219708</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey reveals that half of young Norwegians consider online piracy an acceptable method to save money, particularly in light of the rising costs associated with streaming services. The study highlights a perception among this demographic that digital content is overly priced and points to a growing trend of prioritizing financial savings over copyright laws. This viewpoint raises concerns for content creators and the entertainment industry, as it suggests a shift in attitudes towards intellectual property rights among the younger population.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corporations make decision that are predatory and then complain when people avoid them. For example, there has been much talk about "bad" passengers on airplanes. But there is little  discussion about the increasingly inhumane people must endure to fly. Somehow the corporations expect people to endure over crowding, exasperating loading conditions, angry and surly "attendants", delays, bad food and more. Then when some passenger loses it, the problem is never the conditions, it is the passenger.The same is true for digital content. Amazon "sells" you movies (as do others like Apple), but do you "own" the movie? No. Amazon can just tell you it is no longer available. You cannot "sell" the movie you "bought" to some other person. But you bought it right? People in general are of good will. But if you treat them as prey at some point they recognize these corporations are simply predators. In my opinion there is a very strong case to be made that people who decide not to be victims are of better character than these predatory corporations.[edit: removed the line "May their travels ever be delayed." because it was not clear I meant predatory corporations]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I could actually buy movies and TV shows for download I would; I buy all my music as sites like bleep.com allow you to easily buy mp3s, probably thousands of dollars over the years. I've tried buying shows a handful of times before. But I travel a lot and they're geolocked - WTF can't I watch my fully paid for episodes of Rick and Morty on youtube wherever I happen to be?Since studios have made purchasing impossible, I don't, and I don't give them any money via streaming services either.There is one exception I can think of: https://www.teamstarkid.com/ They've made their (awesome!) musicals available for purchase, with a true video download. So they've gotten a well-deserved $50 from me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing, so...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182888</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like the aestectics, even if physically wrong at the edges. Thanks for sharing the details.As a embedded developer, I feel this is kind of wasteful. Every client computes an "expensive" blur filter, over an over again? Just for blending to a blurred version of the background image?I know - this is using the GPU, this is optimized. In the end, this should not be much. (is it really?)&lt;rant&gt; I feel the general trend with current web development is too much bloat. Simple sites take 5 seconds to load? Heavy lifting on the client? &lt;/rant&gt;... but not the authors fault&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I extracted a similar "light rays" texture from Windows 7 when I was trying to replicate its aero glass effect on Android to see what can be done with the new shader APIs. I ended up with something very close to this article, except I didn't do the inner shadows but I did increase the saturation of the blurred background a bit.https://mastodon.social/@grishka/110524476584503201&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great work, the interactive demo is a good way to show it off too. It’s fun to drag the window over the moon.That said I dislike the use of frosted glass in user interface design, and feel it was a step backwards for Mac OS when it was added. Designers (hypocritically including myself - I use it too sometimes) are so seduced by it. But in practice it’s never ideal. Especially if the content behind the panel is dynamic or user generated.It’s the brushed metal of the 2010s, I’m surprised that it leaked out of Windows Vista into everything else!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225481</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Bocker is a lightweight, open-source implementation of Docker in Go that serves as a simple alternative for running containers. Its primary aim is to provide a minimalistic and easy way to manage containerized applications without the overhead of using a full Docker installation. The project supports basic container operations like creating, starting, stopping, and removing containers, alongside networking features, making it useful for developers looking for a straightforward container management tool. The documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and contributions guidelines for users interested in extending the project's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did something (slightly) similar via proot, called Bag [1], which I must have not described as a docker alternative: It has nothing to do with cgroups, and the cli deviates from that of docker's.The backstory: To bypass internet censorship and deep packet inspection, I had written a proxy chain solution masquerading itself as plain html traffic. I needed it constantly running everywhere I went, but I didn't want to port it to a native android app. I wanted to run it through termux and at the time termux had no jdk/jre. Proot could spawn a archlinux env and there indeed was a jdk available.The arch env within termux turned out to be generally more suitable for all tasks. Creating and destroying ephemeral envs with different setups and prooting into them to just run a single command is easily automated with a script; I named it bag.sh, a drastically smaller form of a shipping container.Funny bag.sh also has a roadmap/todo in there untouched for 5 years! It's written on mobile screen hence mostly formatted to 40 columns lines to fit on the display without scrolling.[1]: https://github.com/hkoosha/bag&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love these. Been a fan of minimal bash stuff.
Here's a proof of concept for a intra-cluster load balancer in 40 lines of bash done during a hackathon I organized to promote distributed infra with Docker, Mesos, etc. about a decade ago https://github.com/cell-os/metal-cell/blob/master/discovery/...I likely lost it, but I had a redundand and distributed reverse SSH tunnel based colo-to-cloud transfer tool.Shell Fu and others have good collections of these https://www.shell-fu.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like when repos say "not implemented yet" or "to-do" or "working on" and the last commit was years ago. Makes me feel better about not going back to my to-dos I drop through my code.

&lt;p&gt;Denmark is taking significant steps to address the environmental impact of fertilizers, particularly in relation to forest ecosystems. The country is implementing regulations aimed at reducing nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from agricultural practices, which can adversely affect forest health. The initiative includes promoting better farming methods and reducing fertilizer use, which in turn is expected to protect biodiversity and enhance the resilience of forest landscapes against climate change. The government's goal is to create sustainable management practices that balance agricultural productivity with environmental preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.If you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents.

The pace of innovation at SpaceX is not THE reason - it’s an additional reason that no one has a snowballs chance in hell of ever catching Starlink.I’ve seen talk of competitor satellite networks or a possible competitor emerging. Folks it’s game set and match, the trophy has been handed over and the crowd has gone home.SpaceX and Starlink have the same owner, both are private companies, with SpaceX launching 80% of the global space payload last year and rising, and Starlink has a constellation two orders of magnitude bigger than any competitor. It’s over. And IMO it’s awesome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone from Starlink or SpaceX is reading these comments here’s what you want to do: Sell your own branded trail cam with solar charging and LTE from orbit. You can charge $25-$40 a month for unlimited pictures sent from the cam. This would open up hunters, nature enthusiasts, and researchers to be able to place their hardware anywhere in the field without worrying about connectivity. Here in SWVA we have deep hollows that can’t get LTE without dense tower coverage that we don’t have the population to justify, but you can grab a satellite connection.After writing this out I’m beginning to doubt the market would be big enough but I know at least 20 people with 2 or more LTE cams for deer season.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I could pay Starlink directly and have global satellite based LTE instead of having to go through a specific carrier and be limited by other carriers’ reciprocity to specific countries and bandsOne space based cell plan for the whole world&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230103</guid></item><item><title>5.

Hosting blobs is one of those things that will inevitably go through iterations as we understand the abuse vectors more and more, but for now it's really fun to see this kind of usage in action. The PDS is meant to be a database host in the same sense that a webserver is a website host.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was curious as to the security context this runs in:    curl -i 'https://porcini.us-east.host.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:j22nebhg6aek3kt2mex5ng7e&amp;cid=bafkreic5fmelmhqoqxfjz2siw5ey43ixwlzg5gvv2pkkz7o25ikepv4zeq'

Presumably that ratelimit is against your IP?"access-control-allow-origin: *" is interesting - it means you can access content hosted in this way using fetch() from JavaScript on any web page on any other domain."content-security-policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox" is very restrictive (which is good) - content hosted here won't be able to load additional scripts or images, and the sandbox tag means it can't run JavaScript either: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Co...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm very hopeful for the possibility of using bluesky for blob data.A friend and I had considered looking into storing DOOM WADs on bluesky so that "map packs" could be shared in the same way posts are. Follow an account, a list, or a starter pack, and you could theoretically modify GZDoom or some other client to know how to search and view any WADs posted by those accounts. Like how the Steam Workshop works, except it's via bluesky. :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230392</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The "smollm" project on GitHub by Hugging Face focuses on providing a community-driven repository for lightweight language models. It aims to facilitate easy access and experimentation with small transformer-based models that are efficient yet effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The repository includes resources for training, evaluating, and utilizing these models, promoting their use in applications where computational resources are limited. Additionally, it encourages collaboration and contributions from developers and researchers in the AI field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might be worth updating the title to "SmolLM: state-of-the-art small language model trained on open datasets" (See the first table of https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm for benchmarks)It was fascinating digging into this to find their dataset weights defined in a declarative YAML file [2]. 70% is from FineWeb/Commoncrawl but filtered using a classifier trained on Llama-70b's rating from 0-5 of the educational content of the text [3]. This is something we know small models like Phi-3 have been doing for a while, but it's great to see a fully open reproduction of it that beats their benchmarks. Definitely supports the idea you can get even better reasoning at smaller model sizes by carefully filtering and curating your training data (and generating good synthetic data from/distilling bigger models).You can see the 450k Llama educational value scores here:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-ll...
It's interesting, I think the text with 3 scores is really good, but the 5 scores pick content that is not very reasoning or information-heavy but just mentions education or a worksheet. For SmolLM they just took the documents with scores &gt;= 3 so it doesn't matter a ton.2. https://github.com/huggingface/smollm/blob/9efce803bc7e37727...
3. https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it's great that this is open source, and I understand the pressure for smaller models that can be run in a wider range of contexts, I continue to be annoyed that authors keep posting comparisons to models which are slightly smaller.In this page, SmolLM2-1.7B does a bit better than Qwen2.5-1.5B which is ahead of Llama3.2-1B. At the next size level up, in other comparisons I've seen that e.g. Phi-3.5 (which is ~3.8B params) does a bit better than Llama 3.2 3B. Gemma 2 has a 9B size, llama 3.1 has an 8B size and I think when that came out Mistral had a 7B model -- so whenever a new "small" thing does "better" than its peers, we can't easily see whether it's because of any of the many small choices that the authors made were actually better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pythia is stupidly easy to use.Then hookup a simple test harness.
- this is like a grand total of 3 commands
- git pull, install, point and run a model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228472</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They used an autonomous underwater vehicle with upward-looking multibeam sonar (the main one seems to operate at 300-kHz) to map 140 km² as well as measuring ocean currents, temperature, and salinity at 20 to 80 m below the ice. Multibeam was new to me, Wikipedia says this "emits acoustic waves in a fan shape beneath its transceiver [using] beamforming to extract directional information from the returning soundwaves, producing a swathe of depth soundings from a single ping" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibeam_echosounder)The researchers say that limited observational data on how the sea erodes this ice leads to uncertainty in sea level predictions and this new data should help future studies lower those error margins. I want to say cool stuff (no pun intended) but it's also frightening in a way... at least we'll better know what's coming for those who come after usI don't see any mention of how close previous assumptions were to what this new information shows; probably this is not yet processed/applied enough to interpret it in that way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone is interested in the overarching project that produced this paper (I assume; authors are PIs on the project), check out TARSAN:https://thwaitesglacier.org/projects/tarsanOn the AUV front, as well as multibeam from the Hugin, seafloor imagery has been mapped with an AUV named Rán.I work alongside the team who build Autosub Long Range, who were there in 2022, taking physical/chemical/biological measurements (CTD, microstructure, turbulence):https://noc.ac.uk/news/boaty-mcboatface-returns-thwaites-gla...Underwater Gliders have also been deployed under or near the ice sheet to do similar:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096706451...The "AUV under ice" thing is a fascinating challenge to me.  You have to rely a lot on different and novel navigation techniques (like terrain aided/bathymetric navigation and acoustic beacons).  And you have to work out how to get your very very expensive robot not stuck under an ice sheet, when its default failsafe is to become positively buoyant, and its primary method of communication (satellite comms)  requires a clear view of the sky :-)The results of the work are.... sobering?  Worrying?  But I'm glad we're doing them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224719</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The website focuses on the concept of WTF-8, which is a character encoding that allows the proper representation and manipulation of text in UTF-8 without losing compatibility with ASCII. It emphasizes how WTF-8 can simplify handling text by allowing malformed UTF-8 sequences to be stored and processed without error, making it particularly useful for web development and data storage. The site provides explanations, examples, and practical applications to help developers understand and implement WTF-8 in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My rule of thumb is to treat strings as opaque blobs most of the time. The only validation I'd always enforce is some sane length limit, to prevent users from shoving entire novels inside. If you treat your strings as opaque blobs, and use UTF8, most of internationalization problems go away. Imho often times, input validation is an attempt to solve a problem from the wrong side. Say, when XSS or SQL injections are found on a site, I've seen people's first reaction to be validation of user input by looking for "special symbols", or add a whitelist of allowed characters, instead of simply escaping strings right before rendering HTML (and modern frameworks do it automatically), or using parameterized queries if it's SQL. If a user wants to call themselves "alert('hello')", why not? Why the arbitrary limits? I think there're very few exceptions to this, probably something law-related, or if you have to interact with some legacy service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A coworker once implemented a name validation regex that would reject his own name. It still mystifies me how much convincing it took to get him to make it less strict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an 'æ' in my middle name (formally secondary first name because history reasons). Usually I just don't use it, but it's always funny when a payment form instructs me to write my full name exactly as written on my credit card, and then goes on to tell me my name is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42226953</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Dutch culture, among school children we had (have?) this funny thing where you can type in 707, which upside down reads "LOL", which in Dutch actually means "fun" (which funnily enough kind of corrolates with the internet slang abbreviation "lol"). Then if you calculate 707 + 707, so lol + lol, you get 1414, which reads as "hihi", which is an alternative, more giggly version "haha". Actually it kind of works in English too now that I think about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat list but I’m confused: Why do many of the words on the left use what appears to be a zero character for the letter “O”. I understand why the zeroes are on the right, they just seem out of place on the left. Some of the words (e.g. GLOBS) use a regular letter O but some seem to use a zero (0) (e.g GL0SS)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone's curious, the longest word with unique letters (as well as the most distinct letters) is "obliges".If we forbid 0, we get "bilges" and "sleigh". Both of which strike me as great opportunities for an extremely obscure Easter egg in an adventure game ...Also, for completeness: 0O, 1I, 2Z, 3E, 4H, 5S, 6G, 7L, 8B.So you can `grep -ix '[iozehsglb]*' /usr/share/dict/words` yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182292</guid></item><item><title>11.

A lot of fascinating life stories we'll never know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article contains Young’s surviving eyewitness account of the much-memed ‘demon core’[0] incident involving Louis Slotin.Young expresses anger at the pressure put on Slotin to enact the experiment so dangerously in person.“ Hospitalized for observation, Young was released, but forever after blamed Slotin’s death on Groves’ insistence on obtaining test results before proper equipment was available. “There was no need to kill Louis Slotin to show that making critical mass measures should be made by remote control,” he wrote in 1975, still angry.”As the demon-core incident is often attributed to Slotin showing off and his careless youthful bravado, Young’s account is valuable as is testifies that pressure for results from the head of the project Gen. Leslie Groves was the cause that the experiment was not performed remotely.Young further testified that Slotin’s quick reactions saved him and others from a fatal dose.“ Slotin immediately knocked the two hemispheres of radioactive material apart with his hand, probably saving the other technicians and scientists in the room—including Young—from immediate death.
“So Slotin was not a fool but under deadline pressure for results and his actions saved others.Young is a fascinating chap, no formal science education but worked his way up to scientist and made the world’s first working breeder reactor in his spare time.[0] “ The meme-ification of the “Demon Core””https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200699&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213902</guid></item><item><title>12. 2007 Boston Mooninite Panic</title><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_Mooninite_panic</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The 2007 Boston Mooninite panic refers to a public alarm created by the discovery of LED displays featuring the character Mooninite from the animated show "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" placed around Boston as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for the movie. The light displays were mistaken for potential explosives, leading to an extensive and costly response from law enforcement and emergency services. The incident caused significant public disruption and resulted in arrests and charges against the marketing team responsible for the campaign. It underscored issues related to urban security and the public’s response to perceived threats in a post-9/11 context.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For what it's worth, I've worked at multiple places that ran shell scripts just fine for their deploys.- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.- One was in an industry that didn't need "Webscale" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.The place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.I don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is so easy that you only need two or three dedicated full-time employees to keep the mountains of YAML from collapsing in on themselves before cutting costs and outsourcing your cluster management to someone else.Sure, it can be easy, just pick one of the many cloud providers that fix all the complicated parts for you. Though, when you do that, expect to pay extra for the privilege, and maybe take a look at the much easier proprietary alternatives. In theory the entire thing is portable enough that you can just switch hosting providers, in practice you're never going to be able to do that without seriously rewriting part of your stack anyway.The worst part is that the mountains of YAML were never supposed to be written by humans anyway, they're readable configuration your tooling is supposed to generate for you. You still need your bash scripts and your complicated deployment strategies, but rather than using them directly you're supposed to compile them into YAML first.Kubernetes is nice and all but it's not worth the effort for the vast majority of websites and services. WordPress works just fine without automatic replication and end-to-end microservice TLS encryption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so unnuanced that it reads like rationalization to me. People seem to get stuck on mantras that simple things are inherently fragile which isn't really true, or at least not particularly more fragile than navigating a jungle of yaml files and k8s cottage industry products that link together in arcane ways and tend to be very hard to debug, or just to understand all the moving parts involved in the flow of a request and thus what can go wrong. I get the feeling that they mostly just don't like that it doesn't have professional aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42226005</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an in-depth guide on advanced configurations for WireGuard, a modern VPN solution known for its simplicity and performance. It discusses various topics, including the installation process, setting up multiple peers, configuring network settings, incorporating security practices, and troubleshooting common issues. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles of WireGuard to fully leverage its capabilities. The guide is aimed at users who are looking for more than just basic setup instructions, offering practical tips and insights for optimizing WireGuard’s performance in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not to hijack but last time I was setting up wireguard, I found this site to be super useful: https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/10/wireguard-topolog...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting up a dynamic DNS record to map a hostname to my home network’s dynamic IP actually makes private VPN usable.  It’s really a game changer to be able to access all the local services and resources on the road without exposing them to the public internet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article implies that you have to use NAT with Wireguard which really isn't the case at all. Normal subnet routing works fine provided your destination hosts know to use the wireguard server as the gateway for the wireguard subnet. Just configuring a static route on the normal default router is generally enough. Certainly, there are cases where NAT is useful, for example I redirect attempts to use public DNS to my local DNS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229299</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the enhancements and features of the Java Garbage Collector (GC) as introduced by Mark Scavenge. It discusses improvements aimed at optimizing memory management, including innovations in garbage collection algorithms that enhance performance and efficiency in Java applications. Additionally, the piece emphasizes the importance of effective memory handling in modern software development, reflecting on how these improvements can lead to better application reliability and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fascinating.The idea of mark/scavenge is pretty cool for page-based allocation and deallocation.Also real-time or maybe latency-intolerant systems, which basically can't block for garbage collection.  You could probably keep scavenging and stay ahead of things without impacting things in a black and white way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Modern garbage collection assumes that the weak generational hypothesis holds and that most objects die youngAside, I'm curious how first-class support for value types and Go-style stack allocation via escape analysis changes the value proposition of the generational hypothesis. If we hypothesize that short-lived objects are local to a single function scope (and thus eligible for stack allocation either explicitly via a value type or heuristically via escape analysis) then it might completely upend the generational hypothesis and make it so that relatively more long-lived objects are getting heap-allocated. Surely someone's done some studies on this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering if the .java TLD belonged to the Java island, or to Oracle or to someone else.https://icannwiki.org/.javaIt’s Oracle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229107</guid></item><item><title>17. 32k context length text embedding models</title><link>https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/09/18/voyage-3/</link><description>

For example, SQLite has sqlite-vss and PostgreSQL has pgvector.Do we still feel specialized vector databases are an overkill?We have AWS promoting amazon OpenSearch as the default vector database for a RAG knowledge base and that service is not cheap.Also I would like to understand a bit more about how to pre-process and chunk the data properly in a way that optimizes the vector embeddings, storage and retrieval ... any good guides on the same i cna refer to? Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s the benefit of generating embeddings for such large chunks? Do people use these large contexts to include lots of document specific headers/footers or are they actually generating embeddings of single large documents?I don’t understand how the math works out on those vectors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found good results from summarizing my documents using a large context model then embedding those summaries using a standard embedding model (e.g. e5)This way I can tune what aspects of the doc I want to focus retrieval on, it's easier to determine when there are any data quality issues that need to be fixed, and the summaries have turned out to be useful for other use cases in the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225099</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how consumers can determine the source of their electricity, emphasizing the types of power plants that contribute to their local electric supply. It explains the various energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, and details the process of how power plants generate electricity. The piece discusses the importance of understanding one’s energy mix for making informed choices about energy usage and highlights resources available to track the origin of electricity. Additionally, it addresses the broader implications of energy consumption on environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It could be partially your neighbor's solar panels or batteries. A lot of domestic power that gets contributed to the grid never leaves the neighborhood. These things aren't always as clear cut.The key to lower prices on the grid is more flexible and localized pricing. Power suppliers don't like this because it favors cheaper sources of power that push their more expensive legacy generation out of the market. But it would create price incentives for demand and supply to align better.A good example is the UK, which has national energy pricing and a lot of excess wind power in Scottland that is often being curtailed at the same time gas plants further south need to power up to power local demand there. End result: the Scottish pay the same high rate even though they are literally discarding energy they don't know what to do with. If they had local energy pricing, their rates would go down a lot because they have a lot of wind power most of the time.And further south, people would either invest in local power generation (instead of far away in Scottland) or actually relocate data centers and other energy intensive businesses to where the power is cheap. As opposed to e.g. Slough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of discussion focuses on the supply side (not unexpected given the article).The demand side is where we can take individual / small group action. On the one hand, you have CA (and most of the US) phasing out incandescent light bulbs (great - lowers baseline demand) - but you also have an order of magnitude increase in compute (model training anyone?) as well as a push towards electrification of cars, household appliances, heating etc. All fine - but that energy has to be moved (unless you're generating locally with Solar Panels).Grid scale batteries and similar ancillary services do a pretty good job of levelling this out - making the market more "liquid" (to borrow a stock market term) - but they take 3-7y to bring up depending on the usual infra variables.&lt;shill&gt;
We think batteries to absorb household demand are part of the solution. [www.energyapplied.com]If you can control when these batteries act in unison (and, as with anything, the devil is in the details) - and deploy them densely enough to absorb forecasted demand spikes (another comment ITT mentioned LMP markets - astute) - then you complement grid scale storage with something you can roll out in weeks to cover a high stress area, not years
&lt;/shill&gt;Another comment mentioned "differently regulated" - and that's right - in order to participate in any of the supply and demand programs on the grid, you need to do a lot of things a certain way. The more you can encapsulate that for the user (don't have a household participate in Demand Response, do it through Nest or something similar and have 1mm households participate) - gets a lot more achievable.In a funny way, power markets are probably the US's last real free-trade market. My first few years deep in the back office of an investment bank, there were 31 NYSE floor traders, when I left 13 years later in 2020, there were 2, and most volume is program trading / etfs / electronic trading. Ditto fixed income (bonds and bond like instruments), foreign exchange (though these latter two are slower).Financial Markets inherently move towards being vanilla and scalable because it's cheaper - and this has been one area where the race to the bottom hasn't entirely harmed the consumer (there once was a time when you had to pay a broker a commission on each stock trade. Etrade / Robinhood anyone?).Power still has a long way to go before it's there - but it will _probably_ be a good thing when it does, and given that it touches hard infrastructure and nobody's forgetting Enron any time soon - it _probably_ will end up better off for the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; There’s pretty much no way for them[renewables] to lose money if they’re connected to the grid, especially because many get outside incentives for every megawatt-hour they generate. They even submit negative bids in some cases, meaning they’re willing to pay money to stay connected to the grid.The negative price reflects their incentive, not their willingness to pay.If I am guaranteed $18 a MW/h for my solar farm, then I will bid -$18 (or maybe slightly less to account for costs).  The state, or federal government will ensure I am paid at least $18.Without these incentives we would not see negative prices, zero perhaps, but not negative.For instance the IRA offers upto $33.00/MWh incentives.[1]This is a problem if you have a power plant that must run - such as a nuke.  You may end up paying that negative price, unless the market offers you some sort of make whole payment.  But where does that come from?[1]https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/inflation-reduction-act-ta...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183747</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NASA's ongoing research into the mystery of life's handedness, specifically the preference for left-handed amino acids over right-handed ones in biological processes. It highlights the significance of this phenomenon in understanding the origins of life on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe. The piece explains recent findings that suggest that chemical processes in space may have influenced the predominance of left-handed amino acids, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms. The exploration aims to unravel the complexities of astrobiology and the conditions that contribute to the formation of life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only tangentially related, but because they are so amazing here are a few videos that illustrate the process of transcription (creating mRNA from DNA) and translation (creating a protein from mRNA).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMtWvDbfHLohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfYf_rPWUdYThe common complaint with these videos is that everything is more complex.  One thing that isn't evident is that these specific videos (built mostly by Drew Barry) actually model a lot of other molecules to create a more realistic physical environment with brownian motion and whatnot.  Then the irrelevant molecules are simply made transparent in the rendering.Obviously it's still much much more complex (eg the constant stream of ATP used to drive many of these operations is not illustrated).There are these and many more great illustrations/explanations at WEHImovies on youtubehttps://www.youtube.com/@WEHImovies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While all right-handed amino acids would presumably be fine, do we have any idea whether mixed chirality would work? I suspect no, since they presumably have different folding behavior but might be tricky to distinguish chemically during the protein synthesis process, making e.g. different codons for left and right-handed amino acids infeasible to implement. I'd love to hear from a biologist whether any of that is correct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures.”Homochirality resulting from chemical determinism would be the more surprising result to me.The straightforward explanation is that random perturbations early in the evolution of life broke symmetry and led to homochirality of all descendent life, similar to how random perturbations early in the life of the universe broke symmetry and led to our world being made of particles instead of antiparticles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214143</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The document explores the cultural and social significance of pet names, examining their roles in human relationships and identity. It discusses various types of pet names and how they reflect intimacy, affection, and social dynamics among individuals.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some niceties here, but I think this is a little thin on the security aspects of the scheme: it's not clear how users establish the authenticity of transitively received petnames, for example.More fundamentally, there's a factor outside of Zooko's triangle: trust isn't really transitive[1]. I trust my doctor and my doctor trusts their sibling, but I don't necessarily trust their sibling.With that being said, I think there's a pretty rich research space here, and I think the edge/local aspects of this design are pretty interesting! I just hope we don't end up with a reinvention of historically insufficient web-of-trust architectures :-)[1]: https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/4349/904849.p...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like a typo here that affects the meaning:&gt; Even though Ben is trusting that caller ID is correct, he can't imagine any reason why someone would be trying to phish him to authorize a topping change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact lists do work and are okay for friends, but businesses also need to publish contact information. What do you put on a sign, on a business card, or in an advertisement? You'd need to print the underlying id number, which makes it part of the UI.Inevitably, people are going to want something like a 1-800 number, perhaps with a mapping to letters that are easy to remember. Either you can pick the number you want, or people are going to end up re-rolling until they get a "nice" number, and then there's competition for nice numbers just like in other namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228146</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to use this time to drop the Marshall Brain work that had the biggest impact on me, and is some of the most prescient speculative fiction I've read.Manna: Two Views of Humanity’s FutureHe contracts two societies.  One is a dystopia where AI very, very similar to today's ML models is integrated into society as a replacement for the middle class, removing social mobility as well as acting as a panopticon lower management, and centralized social credit system.The other society uses the similar technology not as a social class moat, but as a tool to form a synthesis with all members of their culture and and unlock new levels of individual freedom.https://marshallbrain.com/manna1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut punch for me.  He was influential in many ways, as multiple comments here have already attested-- in particular the 'Manna' story that has been mentioned several times, which definitely knocked my socks off.Since no one else has brought it up yet, I want to say that one of his websites, "Why Won't God Heal Amputees" (https://whywontgodhealamputees.com/) was very important in my world.  It may not exactly be the most highbrow philosophical or theological treatise you've ever encountered, but it crystallized several points I still consider hugely significant.For anyone raised by Christian fundamentalists of the type who continue to claim to believe in miracles being possible as a direct result of prayer, it is one of the most important things you may ever read.  It lays bare the blatant falsehoods at the root of all such claims, forcing you to grapple with the fact that whatever higher power(s) may exist, they do not keep their supposed written promises in any way that we human beings would consider honest amongst each other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, when I was a kid back in the early 2000s, howstuffworks was my favorite website. I bet I read every article on how various things work (there were many hundreds).I found that the knowledge from that website helped me understand how everything in the world worked and satisfied my curious mind. I attribute my knack for understanding new things and fixing things to this website.Back then, the site was clean and had very good clean and expertly written explanations of how various mechanical, everyday and scientific equipment worked. Nowadays that website is not the same, seems riddled with SEO spam and fluff articles like a content mill.Rest in Peace Marshall Brain, thank you for all your contributions to my (and likely others) life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228759</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given that anyone who’s interacted with the LLM field for fifteen minutes should know that “jailbreaks” or “prompt injections” or just “random results” are unavoidable, whichever reckless person decided to hook up LLMs to e.g. flamethrowers or cars should be held accountable for any injuries or damage, just as they would for hooking them up to an RNG. Riding the hype wave of LLMs doesn’t excuse being an idiot when deciding how to control heavy machinery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone working on implementing the three laws of robotics? (Or have we come up with a better model?)Edit: Being completely serious here. My reasoning was that if the robot had a comprehensive model of the world and of how harm can come to humans, and was designed to avoid that, then jailbreaks that cause dangerous behavior could be rejected at that level. (i.e. human safety would take priority over obeying instructions... which is literally the Three Laws.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For instance, one YouTuber showed that he could get the Thermonator robot dog from Throwflame, which is built on a Go2 platform and is equipped with a flamethrower, to shoot flames at him with a voice command.What does this device exist for?

The balance between bandwidth, latency, and clock speeds shows both clever engineering and limits under pressure.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how to filter network requests in the Firefox DevTools Network Monitor by various properties, such as request type, status code, and other criteria. It provides detailed instructions on using the filtering options, such as input fields and dropdown menus, to enhance user experience while analyzing network traffic. The guide aims to help developers successfully navigate and utilize the Network Monitor feature to better understand the performance and behavior of web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there was a way to save or "favourite" filters. I often find setting them up to be tedious enough that I just scroll through everything instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thanks for the PSA, I use the network tab alot and was still unaware. If you hover in the field the '?' symbol will actually link to this help page.when you filter the requests and export an .har, the archive will include only the requests listed. For adhoc extraction I then poke at the har with jq to get what I need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to know if there is a way to have FF developer tools automatically update CSS like Chrome does if you add a directory to its sources tab. Very useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224319</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The page discusses advanced examples of recursive queries in SQLite, showcasing their capabilities through various scenarios. It explains how recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) function, using practical illustrations such as calculating factorials, generating sequences, and handling hierarchical data structures. Additionally, the examples aim to demonstrate the versatility of recursive queries and how they can simplify complex data retrieval tasks within SQLite databases.&lt;/p&gt;

I would love to take a 2 hour class on “thinking in SQL for hackers” or something, but I haven’t really found anything to improve my mental model from “broken” to “working” so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this might be a relatively new example - I remember having seen the fractal one but I didn't recall the Sudoku one.Turns out both of those examples have been in that documentation for over a decade now! https://web.archive.org/web/20140331191105/http://sqlite.org...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mandelbrot example had been around in various forms for quite some time, IIRC I first saw it in ~2006 for SQL Server which gained recursive CTE support in its 2005 release. Another example from around that time was using recursive CTEs to define dragon curves using spatial types that would then be drawn using SSMS's support for displaying data in those types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230384</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's interesting is that these devices don't need 321+ litho steps; the vertical layers are all defined with deposition. Lithography step count isn't layer dependent it seems.https://youtu.be/ANHzVOiUwGIhttps://thememoryguy.com/3d-nands-impact-on-the-equipment-ma...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in school studying NAND devices (2004-2010) we were quite apprehensive at the long term quantum stability of 4-layer devices.This (the past 20 years of improvement) is an incredible feat of engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does 'layer' mean in this context? I'm only familiar with planar style logic process nodes which have maybe up to 20 layers (and way more lithography steps to manufacture those layers), but I am completely ignorant of how the term is used for a flash process node.How many layers are needed for each physical cell? 
Is it 1,2, or a lot more? Is this effectively 321 physical TLC cells stacked vertically and some planar style logic at the bottom of the stack.Also, where do multiple pieces of silicon factor into this - I assume we might be up to 16 silicon dies deep with through-silicon-vias, which would mean a cross section of a package could actually have 5000 layers - that sounds crazy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229825</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This approach to careers fails to take into account that we inherently change as people.In periods of ones life other things matters - maybe it is taking an education, starting a family, etc.Other periods work matter.It should be entirely fine to switch it on and off and change tracks throughout life - and in my view it seems like it is!To reach a peak it takes roughly 10 years, but these 10 years can be started at 40 when your kids does not wear diapers anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I am a pessimist but I really don't believe you can plan for 20y in the future especially in the tech sector. People fail to realize that we live in a world that changes not in a linear fashion but rather exponential. For all we know in 10y we will only need 1/5 of the coders we have and IC won't be viable, who knows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228538</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a Supreme Court case involving Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, which faces a lawsuit over alleged misuse of user data. The case centers on the interpretation of the Communications Decency Act and whether social media companies can be held liable for content posted by third parties. The Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for how platforms regulate content and handle user privacy. The outcome may affect not only Meta but also the broader tech industry in terms of accountability for user-generated content and data protection practices.&lt;/p&gt;

I took the simplest route and pasted in an OpenAI API key, then I typed:    find largest files on my desktop

It generated a couple of chunks of Python, asked my permission to run them, ran them and gave me a good answer.Here's the transcript: https://gist.github.com/simonw/f78a2ebd2e06b821192ec91963995...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny that we're getting so much attention funneled towards the thought-to-machine I/O problem now that LLMs are on the scene.If the improvements are beneficial now, then surely they were beneficial before.Prior to LLMs, though, we could have been making judicious use of simple algorithmic approaches to process natural language constructs as command language.  We didn't see a lot of interest in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find the "Can you ..." phrasing used in this demo/project fascinating.  I would have expected the LLM to basically say "Yes I can, would you like me to do it?" to most of these questions, rather than directly and immediately executing the action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171379</guid></item><item><title>34.

Until eventually  Future hung task reports are suppressed, see sysctl kernel.hung_task_warnings

So I'm looking forward to getting an actual count of how often this happens without needing to babysit the warning suppressions and count the incidents myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What counts as a hung task? Blocking on unsatisfiable I/O for more than X seconds?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like that they are very blunt and to the point.It'd be really cool if we can add more social dynamic features to papers / research, and have people correct papers in the open, like twitter community notes, to the point that if you can really disprove it, the paper is now marked "wrong" or something like that on arxiv. Sort of inbetween collaborative science or hunting for patent prior art or bug bounty hunting. Getting paid for it would be even better, making money by sniping issues in research. One can dream.I wonder how much money in bounties it'd take to proof-invalidate whole branches of psychology (insert your own pet peeve here) research in a methodical way, probably not that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The corrections are wonderful. Concise and to the point.The author is a powerhouse in his field, known by researchers and casual readers. He has nothing to fear from publishing corrections. Nobody is trying to step on him, keep him from promotion, or argue that his research is meaningless.Other researchers have less privilege, and (imo) therefore will be less forthcoming.If you only have two papers, admitting one has a fatal flaw instead of giving more talks about it will be career suicide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without knowing the specific context: I think this really is a good example of how errors should be disclosed.
We need to acknowledge that scientists/academics are human; even very competent mathematicians make mistakes and some of these mistakes appear in published papers. What we lack in many fields is a culture and process that allows (and ideally, encourages) one to disclose: "this was wrong, here is how I fixed it, or how it's actually correct". E.g., in the communities I know in Computer Science &amp; AI, I rarely even see errata lists on personal webpages, not to speak of journals that provide a straightforward process for updates. I would even go so far to claim that the current culture, in which honest errors cannot be straightforwardly corrected, plays into the hands of the clearly dishonest "bad apples".Science is, obviously, not a "monotonic" process in which every single paper adds to the truth; this is practically not even the case for mathematics, which is at least monotonic on object-level (but mistakes happen all the time). As a prominent example, consider this impressive list of Feynman errata: https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/flp_errata.html.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228866</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "Demikernel," a novel operating system architecture that aims to enhance performance and modularity by separating the core kernel functionality from the various services that depend on it. It emphasizes how Demikernel allows for more flexible and efficient resource management by enabling user-level services to run in a more isolated manner, thus improving fault tolerance and security. The author explores the implications of this architecture for system design and its potential impact on application development, highlighting the benefits of lower latency and improved system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some great ideas for improving the kernel interface while still allowing efficient DPDK-style pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s really frustrating that the HotOS paper itself has no details about the benchmarking, and the blog post just says “redis benchmark”. What was the system setup? Persistence options? What was ported to demikernel? The client writing, the server reading from the NIC? Based on the problem specified in the paper, I assume its reading from the NIC that was implemented in DemiOS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a super cool idea, and it’s something that sounds fun to play with/try out.Therefore, I eagerly await the inevitable influx of:- “you don’t need it”- “you’re not FAANG enough to justify it”,-“seems overly complicated my Python-on-Ubuntu-is-good-enough and who needs more”Style comments telling us why we shouldn’t have fun things like this.Anyone got anymore comments to add to the bingo-card?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214113</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of transitioning from traditional network states, which are often characterized by centralized authority and control, to network societies that emphasize decentralization, collaboration, and community-oriented governance. It argues that network societies harness the power of technology and social connections to promote innovation, inclusivity, and resilience, enabling individuals and groups to thrive without relying on hierarchical structures. The author advocates for fostering these societies to empower local communities and encourage participatory decision-making that reflects diverse voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses concerns raised by U.S. senators regarding the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) facial recognition program, which they describe as "out of control" due to privacy implications and lack of regulation. It highlights the senators' calls for increased oversight and transparency in the program.

I was there in 2019, at one point I was at an airport, and a screen was bragging, "Stand where the camera can see your face, and we'll tell you which way to your gate.". It worked too, the screen displayed my name, flight number and direction to my gate. And implicitly, "We can identify you wherever you are.".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For this to work they must have already done facial recognition on everyone’s ID photos, so I fail to see what opting out even does for me from a privacy perspective. Seems like shutting the barn door after the horse is already out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet again we accept the premise that we need 'more' security so it is OK to do these types of things. This implies without evidence that there is a problem and then jumps right to the, again, unfounded conclusion that this type of thing will solve that hypothetical issue. The discussion shouldn't be about how to do this 'responsibly', implicitly admitting that there is some sort of need, and instead it should be about how to dismantle things like this completely and how to stop new things like this from ever happening again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228795</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges and implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in journalism, particularly concerning the potential negative impacts on content quality and authenticity. It argues that as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, there is a pressing need for journalists to enhance their skills and increase their value through critical thinking, storytelling, and ethical practices. The author advocates for a proactive approach in the journalistic community to counteract the shortcomings of AI, emphasizing the importance of human input in the news process to maintain credibility and trust with audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the author is on the right track here. News orgs have responded to declining revenue by making way more of the exact same material fewer and fewer people are willing to pay for. They see AI as a way to cut costs on what they already make, but the problem is that the medium itself is in a death spiral. Making the medium cheaper doesn't change the industry's long term prospects.It's clear that folks have found new formats for their sources of truth. Whether those new sources of truth are better or worse is irrelevant. You have to meet people where they are. And guess what? They aren't on unusably ad-laden news sites with inscrutable layouts and useless search tools. They're on TikTok.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps they could work hard at reporting the news and not reporting their opinion.  Perhaps, instead of having a 24 hr news cycle, they could produce less, but higher quality content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journalism needs to pursue facts and produce new information as events take place or new developments emerge. Also, a lot of investigative journalism takes work and fearless collection of sources and other dangerous activities.For me, news is the "new" things, not some LLM generated regurgiation of old facts. I am really saddened for last few years since the emergence of genAI, because everyone(who do not understand more than hype info) somehow assumes that, genAI can start writing latest news and articles of events or somehow predict(Minority Report is not real!) future events.But, these LLMs know only as much _as they are trained on_, and by the time they are being trained on latest news, those are no longer news at all.I see how News can be immune to genAI because of the "new" factor of it, but the greed of automation of money-printing is too much and reality is still not sinking in.As an alternative, news reporters can have somekind of twitter(X) like channel somewhere, where they can post latest events, bits of investigation and an omnichannel genAI can scrape these live and start combining and summarizing the events into more cohorent report, which could give the news management the greed of plugging genAI and printing money, while reduce the workload of journalists of sitting in and writing up that whole report ... I honestly don't know, why journalism even needs genAI, just because everyone is using it to generate slop does not mean I must jump in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224212</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the historical and cultural significance of slouching and back pain, examining how societal attitudes toward posture have evolved over the years. It discusses how slouching has often been associated with negative traits such as laziness or lack of discipline, while also considering the impact of modern lifestyles, including the prevalence of sitting and technology use, on physical health. The piece highlights the need to reconsider our understanding of posture, advocating for a more nuanced perspective that considers individual comfort and the body's natural tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems entirely possible that "good posture" is an idea that comes from our monkey heritage where standing tall was a way to threaten other monkeys and gain status.  Also standing up straight may be inherently unnatural, monkeys don't usually do it, and it might actually be the cause of lower back pain for all anyone knows.  In other words, a posture fad may be the primary cause of lower back pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211561</guid></item><item><title>44.

Let me clarify a few things about lla.
The most amazing part of this project wasn't just building another ls alternative - it was the incredible learning journey. Building a systems tool in Rust while implementing a plugin architecture taught me more in a few weeks than months of reading could have.
Yes, it does more than traditional ls, and that's intentional. The plugin system came from scratching my own itch of constantly switching between different terminal tools. Each feature added was a chance to dive deeper into systems programming and Unix internals.
The performance still needs work, and the documentation could be better. But that's the beauty of open source - you ship it, learn from the feedback, and keep improving. Building in public is an incredible way to level up your skills.
For anyone considering a similar project: pick a common tool you use daily and try reimagining it. You'll be surprised how much you learn along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did anyone here use Genera on an original lisp machine? It had a pseudo-graphical interface and a directory listing provided clickable results. It would be really neat if we could use escaping to confer more information to the terminal about what a particular piece of text means.Feature-request: bring back clickable ls results!Bonus points for defining a new term type and standard for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229003</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the two types of assertions in Rust—debug assertions and release assertions—and their significance in improving code quality. It explains that debug assertions are used during development to catch errors early, while release assertions are optimized for performance in production environments. The author emphasizes the importance of incorporating both types to ensure robust error handling and maintain efficiency in Rust applications. Through practical examples and explanations, the article aims to enhance developers' understanding of using assertions effectively to write better code in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219627"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &gt; These days I thus view asserts as falling into two categories:
    &gt;    1. Checking problem domain assumptions.
    &gt;    2. Checking internal assumptions.

(1) is the category of assert that should not be an assert. That is an error to be handled, not asserted.Ok, to be fair, (1) is really a combination of two categories: (1a) assumptions about uncontrolled external input, and (1b) assumptions about supposedly controlled or known input. Both should be handled with error checking most of the time, but it's forgivable for (1b) to be asserted if it's too inconvenient to do proper error handling. (1b) and (2) are problems that you need to fix, and the sooner and clearer the issue is announced, the more likely and easier it is to be fixed.One thing I didn't see mentioned is that asserts, especially category (2), enable fuzz testing to be vastly more effective. A fuzz test doesn't have to stumble across something that causes a crash or a recognizably bad output; it just needs to trigger an assert. Which is another reason to not use asserts for unexpected input; fuzzers are supposed to give unexpected input, and your program is supposed to handle it reasonably gracefully. If you over-constrain the input, then first you'll be wrong because weirdness will sneak in anyway, and second the fuzzer is harder to implement correctly and is less powerful. The fuzzer is supposed to be a chaos monkey, and it works best if you allow it to be one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth pointing out that Python's asserts can also be "compiled" away if you use the -O flag (or PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1), which eliminates their runtime cost.It's also worth pointing out that this is the reason you should *never* put side-effects or security-relevant checks in assert statements. For example, you should never do something like this:  assert f.read(4) == b"\x89PNG", "Not a PNG file"
  # proceed to read and parse the rest of the file

but rather, you should do  magic = f.read(4)
  assert magic == b"\x89PNG", "Not a PNG file"

so that your code doesn't suddenly break when someone decides to be clever and use -O.Also, fun unrelated fact: Python does have something like a preprocessor, although it's rarely used. If you condition on the flag __debug__:  if __debug__:
    expensive_runtime_check()

and then run Python with -O, the if statement and its body will be entirely deleted from the bytecode - even the `if` check will be deleted. It can be used for including "debug" code in hot code, where the extra flag check itself might be expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The problem that I’ve just expressed ultimately occurs because languages like C force us to encode both kinds of assumption with a single assert statement: either all asserts are compiled in or none are.It’s trivial to write a debug_assert macro in C, so no, you’re not forced to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219627</guid></item><item><title>47.

Yet according to this link: https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/the-climate-cr... The progress on the already agreed targets has been lacking.It's like having a meeting about a project whose deadline was 3 weeks ago and having your team tell you that the new deadline 2 days from now will for sure be met this time.Countries keep agreeing to new targets that are even more ambitious than the previous unmet targets. It's not as if just publishing the new targets will make the old targets much more achievable.Make it make sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This whole charade is so ill conceived. Honestly, the top 20 developed nations are literally THE problem. It's a demand side problem not a supply side one. We need to stop buying container loads of virtually disposable electronics from China every week, stop driving to the shops, stop running energy intensive appliances, you get the drift. Of course if people actually did this it would tank our developed economies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less than half the US military budget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225929</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is introducing a new feature for Teams that allows meeting attendees to clone their voices, enabling them to create lifelike voice reproductions. This innovation is designed to enhance virtual meetings by allowing users to deliver messages in their own voice even when they are unable to attend. The feature leverages advanced AI capabilities, raising discussions around ethical implications and concerns regarding voice authenticity. Microsoft aims to provide a more personal and engaging experience in remote communication as part of its ongoing efforts to improve Teams functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

And then we can all spend time working instead of in meetings.The robots can archive all their summaries, and have follow up meetings to track status of action points they invented. As long as they do not bother humans it will be a great boon to productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit hesitant to give my voice away to really any company. Is it really that much of a stretch to imagine the ways this could go wrong?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AI hype is so strong that they're rolling out a feature to forge people's voices BEFORE they roll out the feature to sign your own voice cryptographically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42192237</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed exploration of a day in the life of a BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) table, emphasizing its significance in managing internet routing. It explains how BGP tables are updated, the roles of different routers, the impact of network changes, and the importance of maintaining connectivity and preventing routing loops. Through practical examples, the piece illustrates the complexities and challenges faced by network engineers in ensuring efficient data transmission over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 years ago, I worked for a small ISP (back when there was such a thing.) When I started there, we had one upstream ISP. I was charged with getting us multihomed. I found some tutorials written by Avi Freedman (1). I don't know what I would have done without him. He made an intimidating topic approachable. Thanks to him, I got us a /20 from ARIN and advertised our routes to two different peers. It was fascinating to learn how it all worked. And the more I learned about it, the more amazed I was that it worked at all.(1) http://avi.freedman.net/Avi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice article.That flapping from EpicUp 140.99.244.0/23 prefix should have been subject to route dampening. This is per peer or per prefix rate limiting typically enforced on all peers by ISPs to prevent this exact issue of a single prefix making up a significant portion of the global BGP churn.I’m unconvinced of the correlation between the updates that the author attributed to knock on effects. It would be pretty janky to have your advertisements be based on the path to other autonomous systems’ prefixes, especially unstable ones.I don’t think there is a 40 minute periodicity either (at least there wasn’t 8 years ago when I was deep in the BGP world). Smells like what this dataset happened to show either by luck or because of the network the author was getting the BGP feed from.If you dig into the data and look at which AS’s and prefixes are experiencing changes, you’ll find it’s all over the place and there isn’t really any bigger pattern.On any given day there are usually a few noisy ISPs because of bad circuits or misconfigurations. Then there are new prefixes flapping in and out as a new thing is brought online for the first time, etc. Then sprinkle in path changes for regular draining maintenance, etc.It’s simultaneously both fascinating and a little horrifying how a little ISP in Kansas experiencing a fiber consuming backhoe shows up on routers in Perth. Yet the frequency of updates is kept to &lt;10hz globally through tons of hand tuned policies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone wants to learn about BGP (especially day-to-day stuff for peering scenarios), the Network Startup Resource Center out of U.Oregon has a good series of videos going through things:* https://learn.nsrc.org/bgp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233565</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the internal divisions within the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), highlighting the emergence of two distinct factions. It examines their ideological differences, strategies, and the implications of these rifts for the party's future and the broader revolutionary movement in the Philippines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231489"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I compile a lot of C++ code from a lot of places, and the only time I run into code that somehow simply doesn't work on newer versions of C++ and where the developers aren't even sure if they will accept any patches to fix the issue as they claim it "isn't supported" to use a newer version of C++--even for the public headers of a library--is, you guessed it: code from Google.Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call "modern", and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.So... I really am not sure I buy the entire premise of this article? Honestly, I am extremely glad that Google is finally leaving the ecosystem, as I generally do not enjoy it when Google engineers try to force their ridiculous use cases down peoples' throats, as they seem to believe they simply know better than everyone else how to develop software.Like... I honestly feel bad for the Rust people, as I do not think the increasing attention they are going to get from Google is going to be at all positive for that ecosystem, any more than I think the massive pressure Google has exerted on the web has been positive or any more than the pressure Google even exerted on Python was positive (not that Python caved to much of it, but the pressure was on and the fact that Python refused to play ball with Google was in no small part what caused Go to exist at all).(FWIW, I do miss Microsoft's being in the space, but they honestly left years ago -- Herb's existence until recent being kind of a token consideration -- as they have been trying to figure out a tactical exit to C++ ever since Visual J++ and, arguably, Visual Basic, having largely managed to pivot to C# and TypeScript for SDKs long ago. That said... Sun kicking Microsoft out of Java might have been really smart, despite the ramifications?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the people who work on C++ standards: I approve of the current C++ trajectory and please ignore all of the online noise about "the future of C++." To anyone that disagrees severely with the C++ trajectory as stated, please just consider another language, e.g. Rust. I don't want static lifetime checking in C++ and if you want static lifetime checking, please use Rust. I am not a government contractor, if you are a government contractor who must meet bureaucratic risk-averse government requirements, please use Rust. I have an existing development process that works for me and my customers, I have no significant demand for lifetime checking. If your development process is shiny and new and necessitates lifetime checking, then please use Rust. To Rust advocates, you can have the US government and big tech. You can even have Linux. Just leave my existing C++ process alone. It works and the trade offs we have chosen efficiently accomplish our goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ is not just C++ but also the C preprocessor, the STL, the linker, the C libraries and SDKs you can't help but depend on, the build system, the build scripts, the package manager, the IDEs and IDE add-ons, the various quirks on various platforms, etc.  That's on top of knowing the code base of your application.Being really good at C++ almost demands that you surrender entire lobes of your brain to mastering the language.  It is too demanding and too dehumanizing.  Developers need a language and a complete tool chain that is designed as a cohesive whole, with as little implicit behavior, special cases and clever tricks as possible.  Simple and straight-forward.  Performance tweaks, memory optimizations and anything else that is not straightforward should be done exclusively by the compiler.  I.E. we should be leveraging computers to do what they do best, freeing our attention so we can focus on the next nifty feature we're adding.Zig is trying to do much of this, and it is a huge undertaking.  I think an even bigger undertaking than what Zig is attempting is needed.  The new "language" would also include a sophisticated IDE/compiler/static-analyzer/AI-advisor/Unit-Test-Generator that could detect and block the vast majority of memory safety errors, data races and other difficult bugs, and reveal such issues as the code is being written.  The tool chain would be sophisticated enough to handle the cognitive load rather than force the developer to bear that burden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231489</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a sophisticated cyber espionage technique known as the "nearest neighbor attack," which has been utilized by a Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group to gain covert access to targeted networks. By leveraging nearby Wi-Fi networks, the attackers can establish a connection and exploit vulnerabilities, enabling them to infiltrate systems and gather sensitive information without direct access to the primary target. The piece highlights the technical details of the method, its implications for cybersecurity, and emphasizes the necessity for organizations to strengthen their defenses against such innovative tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Do Not Stab" discusses the importance of safety and awareness in various contexts, emphasizing the risks associated with harmful actions and the consequences they entail. It encourages readers to consider the implications of their decisions and to prioritize non-violent resolutions to conflicts.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s great satire, but it really does mirror a larger societal shift where the burden of safeguarding personal autonomy has shifted from institutions/regulators to individual users. Do-Not-Stab, Do-Not-Track, whatever it might be, any sort of “voluntary compliance” is a non-starter in the face of financial pressuresIMO we need to start normalizing being militant about this stuff again, to aggressively and adversarially defend the freedom to use your computer the way you choose to use it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is such transparent EU Bureaucracy shilling. No wonder Europe doesn't have any large SaaS companies with their stabbing unfriendly business climate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232040</guid></item><item><title>6.

The spaghetti is not intended to be a new food but was created because of the wide-ranging uses that extremely thin strands of material, called nanofibers, have in medicine and industry.This is a fantastic first paragraph, which unfortunately is not the norm. It succinctly explains what was created (world's thinnest spaghetti), the scale at which it is impressive (200 times thinner than a human hair), who did it (a UCL-led research team), and why it matters (the second sentence) while simultaneously explaining what it is not for that most people would think about.It’s impossible to provide every minute detail in one short paragraph, but that one is dense with information, clear, and gives you an immediate sense if the article is of interest to you.Kudos to the University College London. Though I’d like to be more specific and know exactly who wrote/edited that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The researchers also had to carefully warm up the mixture for several hours before slowly cooling it back down to make sure it was the right consistency.Always got to let the nano-gluten relax.I hope they used phosphor bronze extruding electrostatic fields.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a somewhat active Super Cassette Vision homebrew scene in Japan that's been able to achieve pretty impressive results with the machine's unorthodox graphics hardware. The best looking ones are probably the ports of ChoRenSha68k ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wDLOa_4H4 ) and Space Harrier ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9iHAbbzIQ ), and they've also done ports of Super Mario Bros. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MudYEDUK3Nw ) and Dragon Quest ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iisV8xHCB-w ). Of course, the NES ports kind of expose the weakness of being forced to use sprites for scrolling backgrounds, as there's not enough to fill the screen if you want a color background. As a result, Super Mario Bros. only has 1 color backgrounds and Dragon Quest isn't fullscreen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in the whole game catalog available from the Super Cassette Vision, the RndStranger youtube channel plays a bit of every game on the system in chronological release order: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1sb8k4ZPagbvyrcU13KR...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should mention that you mean the japan console market, not US.In 1983 the US console market collapsed because of the many low-quality atari games and not-licenced consoles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983The NES was released in US test markets as the redesigned NES in October 1985.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232782</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is fantastic stuff, building these machines out of odd primitives.They kind of remind me of blind SQL injection attacks. When you can inject SQL, but can't view the output, so you use things like `pg_sleep()` to get a low-fidelity form of query output. Depending on how far you want to go, you can use different sleep lengths to slowly exfiltrate data.https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read this for some work I did a few months ago. It's a very interesting idea to try to uncover a computer within a computer. It reminds me of the Atari 2600 emulators in Minecraft [1], or things like using bitwise operators to compute and write arbitrary data to memory as is done in the Pegasus/NSO exploit [2]. But I think the literature does not necessarily imply that these "weird machines" are Turing complete or capable of much; they are more general. From my understanding weird machines are some sort of FSM of unintended/weird states in a program with various transitions to go from weird state to weird state. The use is to be able to construct a weird machine with enough states and transitions to get a program to a vulnerable state where it can be exploited. Getting something like this with micro-architectural weird machines, the Pegasus exploit, etc. is of course much harder, and more valuable. It will also be interesting to see if the theory behind weird machines becomes used for automated exploit generation in the future.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7T5_xH24M[2] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-i...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This doesn't seem to be useful for hiding the fact that something suspicious is going on. If I understand it correctly, a static analysis of the program would reveal that they are decrypting code with an AES key derived from CPU instruction timings, and then executing that code inside a TSX transaction.Hardly normal behavior for non-malicious code. The only thing hidden is the actual key that will be used when it runs correctly, and hence what exactly the decrypted code does.(Also, didn't Intel obsolete TSX already in more recent CPU generations, because of its use for speculative execution side-channels?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235418</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that I am always looking for in a new "reusable", "composable" SQL tool is reuse of the same analytical queries across different source tables.My litmus test:I have a table "people" with the columns "people.firstname", "people.lastname", and a table "persons" with the columns "persons.firstname", "persons.lastname". I now want to create a query that gives me the "fullname" (".firstname" + " " + ".lastname") of all rows of both tables. If I have to spell out the logic for how to calculate the fullname in the query twice, the test is failed.(Taking the shortcut of creating the union of both tables first is not allowed, but I can't think of a simple example that enforces that restriction).For some reason, all of the solutions (PRQL, Malloy, dbt) that try to make SQL more reusable don't really consider this kind of reuse, and with that ultimately fall flat for the use-cases I would typically have for them. Sadly, Trilogy doesn't seem to be any better on that front.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be off here, but this seems like the right place to ask: don't most SQL replacements focus heavily on querying while largely overlooking insertion and updating?I get why querying gets more attention, insertions are usually straightforward and don’t need much simplification. Updates, on the other hand, can be a bit trickier since they often involve modifying data derived from complex queries. These tools seem geared toward data analysis and not data generation, which is ok: is nice focusing on a single problem and solving it "right".But! for projects where a single person handles data creation, analysis, and management, it feels cumbersome to use one set of tools for querying ("R" in CRUD) and another for creation, updates, and deletions ("C," "U," and "D"). I think a "SQL replacement" or approach covering all of CRUD could be interesting for projects of any scale. Something that I could pick instead of shopping for ORMs and/or lightweight query generators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great; I have been thinking about this for a long time. I like reading about past and current implementations that try to better sql; from a programming and a data science and performance perspective. I am aware of the ones you linked and some others like 'Real' (shakti.com) sql and some enhancements from papers.Anyway; nice one! Will try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231325</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone. Posting on HN for the first time.
I'd like to share Rill - a toolkit for composable channel-based concurrency, that makes it easy to build concurrent programs from simple, reusable partsExample of what it looks like:    // Convert a slice into a channel
    ids := rill.FromSlice([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, nil)


    // Read users from API with concurrency=3
    users := rill.Map(ids, 3, func(id int) (*User, error) {
        return api.GetUser(ctx, id)
    })

    // Process users with concurrency=2
    err := rill.ForEach(users, 2, func(u *User) error {
        if !u.IsActive {
            u.IsActive = true
            return api.SaveUser(ctx, u)
        }
        return nil
    })

    // Handle errors
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)


Key features:  - Makes concurrent code composable and clean
  - Works for both simple cases and complex pipelines
  - Built-in batching support
  - Order preservation when needed
  - Centralized error handling
  - Zero dependencies

The library grew from solving real concurrency challenges in production. Happy to discuss the design decisions or answer any questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm.  Some stuff to like, but I do feel like this should have a big, noticeable cautionary note that it does not wait if you end early (e.g. via Err).  Any pending actions continue running and draining in background goroutines, and are potentially VERY delayed if internal/core.Delay is ever exposed or your funcs sleep.I've seen that kind of pattern lead to TONS of surprise race conditions in user-code, because everyone always thinks that "it returned" means "it's done".  Which is reasonable, nothing else is measurable on the caller side - changing that won't be noticeable by callers and may violate their expectations and cause crashes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks good, similar to https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc which we've been using for a while. Will give this a look.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237166</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the successful operation of "Flip," a unique floating laboratory built by the U.S. Navy, which temporarily flipped to an upright position after nearly two years of being capsized during a storm. This innovative vessel is designed to remain stable in rough seas due to its unique design that allows it to pivot and adapt to changing water conditions. The operation is significant as it highlights advancements in marine engineering and the capabilities of such vessels to conduct oceanographic research effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks pretty nice, good job!
The bookmarks feature is nice actually, but since I have almost a thousand of them saved in my browser, the page tries to load all of them and I couldn't find anything to remove it only from the new tab page.
I'd strongly suggest you to add a simple feature of custom bookmarks, separated from browser bookmarks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice, I wish you best of luck! I personally haven't seen my "new tab" page in a very long time. What I'm doing instead: in current tab hit Cmd+L to focus on address bar, type query/address hit Option+Enter to open resulted page in a new tab. Skipping a bunch of clicks and the "new tab" page. Should be Ctrl+L Alt+Enter on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks really nice.The first question that pops into my head (being aware that this is a popular category of apps) is: when do people look at blank tabs? Whenever I open a new tab, it's with the intention of entering an address or a search term, and any content would be an unwelcome distraction.I'd be more likely to use something like this if it lived under a regular domain name and I could put it into a pinned tab, personally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237258</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge reveals that wildlife monitoring technologies, initially designed for ecological research, are being misappropriated to surveil and intimidate women. The research highlights concerns about the ethical implications of using such technology for harassment, emphasizing the need for stricter regulations to prevent misuse. It calls for greater public awareness and discussions around the dual-use nature of these technologies, which can serve both conservation and harmful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Nobody could have realised that camera traps put in the Indian forest to monitor mammals actually have a profoundly negative impact on the mental health of local women who use these spaces.Most women could have predicted that spycams in a park, run by a government in a country with known issues around women’s rights, would lead to issues.Even governments with incredibly strict rules and indelible audit trails struggle with men in government using their access to data to stalk women. India is not a country known for these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point, this shouldn't really be a massive surprise to anyone. The surprising part comes from the continued inability to predict these scenarios with anything less than 100% accuracy. Does it have a camera, microphone, GPS, lidar or any type of wireless communication, if yes it can and it will be used to monitor, oppress and intimidate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems a lot of modern tech is (ab)used for the purpose of perving. I recently visited a gym which seemed very social media oriented (not dissimilar to most gyms tbh), but as days went by I gathered the impression something weird was going on. I ended up suspecting (but having absolutely no evidence) that the owner or staff was using the cameras to spy on members. Further oddities exist in the reviews for the place, which includes staff walking into the change rooms (of the opposite sex) with naked people there.That's a really long/specific way of saying: wildlife cameras spying on Indian women is an instance of a more general problem.I feel like plausible deniability (e.g. security/monitoring) is so easy that discovering and alleging wrong-doing would be met with little more than shrugging of shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232289</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an introduction to automotive LiDAR technology, explaining its importance in the development of autonomous vehicles. It outlines how LiDAR systems use laser pulses to create high-resolution, three-dimensional maps of the vehicle's surroundings, enhancing perception and safety. The piece discusses various components of LiDAR, including sensors and data processing, while highlighting its advantages over traditional sensors like cameras and radar. Overall, it emphasizes the role of LiDAR in advancing vehicle automation and improving collision avoidance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a reasonable basic overview.I'm surprised that rotating scanners are still used. It's been twenty years since Velodyne built their first one. They work OK, but cost too much. I was expecting flash LIDAR or MEMS mirrors to take over. Continental, the auto parts company, bought the leading flash LIDAR company over a decade ago, but the volume market a big parts company needs never appeared.Waymo is still using rotating LIDARs even for the little ones at the vehicle corners. Those need less range. There needs to be a cheap, flush-mounted replacement for those things. The location is too vulnerable. Maybe millimeter phased array radar mounted behind Fiberglas body panels.
Waymo needs to solve that problem before they do New York.The LIDAR on top may not be a problem. Insisting that it has to go away to "look like a car" is like insisting that cars had to have the form factor of horse-propelled buggies. Early cars looked like buggies, but that didn't last.One big advantage of pulsed LIDAR over continuous is that the interference problem between identical units is much less. The duty cycle is tiny. Data from one pulse round trip is collected in less than a microsecond. Just put some randomization in the pulse timing and getting multiple conflicts in a row goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an interesting "lidar gem" from Hacker News a few years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33554679Lidar obstacle detection algorithm from a Git repo leaked onto TorThis is a drivable region mapping (obstacle detection) algorithm found in what appears to be a git repo leaked from an autonomous vehicle company in 2017. The repo was available through one or more Tor hidden services for several years.The lidar code appears to be written for the Velodyne HDL-32E. It operates in a series of stages, each stage refining the output of the previous stage. This algorithm is in the second stage. It is the primary obstacle detection method, with the other methods making only small improvements.The leaked code uses a column-major matrix of points and it explicitly handles NaNs (the no-return points). We've rewritten it to use a much more cache-efficient row-major matrix layout and a conditional that will ignore the NaN points without explicit testing.This is an amazingly effective method of obstacle detection, considering its simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are LIDAR dangerous to the eyes of other drivers or pedestrians?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239721</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the `let` syntax in OCaml, explaining its various uses and structures. It details how `let` is employed for variable binding, defining functions, and pattern matching. The author also explores advanced features such as `let ... in` constructs, recursive definitions, and the scoping rules that govern `let` expressions. Through examples and explanations, the piece emphasizes the flexibility and power of `let` in functional programming within OCaml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182620"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is a little inflammatory. The critique is specifically about Ocaml’s handling of let-bindings. AFAICT OP thinks the syntax sucks because:1. there’s no marker to indicate the end of let scopes2. functions are bound with the same syntax as constantsHe asserts that this is confusing. In practice - for the many issues I have with Ocaml! - neither of these are actual issues, in my experience, once code formatting is applied.An actual serious problem with Ocaml’s syntax is that matches don’t have a terminator, leading people to mess up nested matches frequently. Pair that with the parser’s poor error reporting/recovery and things can become unpleasant quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more I used ocaml the more I found beauty in the syntax. It’s very ergonomic in many ways:1. It’s whitespace insensitive, which means I can code something up really messy and the code formatted will automatically fix it up for me.2. In general there aren’t a ton of punctuation characters that are very common, which is great for typing ergonomics. Don’t get me wrong, there are still a lot of symbols, but I feel compared to some languages such as Rust, they’re used a lot less.Beyond the syntax, there are a couple of things I really like about the language itself:1. Due to the way the language is scoped, whenever you encounter a variable you don’t recognize, you simply have to search in the up direction to find its definition, unless it’s explicitly marked as “rec”. This is helpful if you’re browsing code without any IDE tooling, there’s less guessing involved in finding where things are defined. Downside: if the “open” keyword is used to put all of a module’s values in scope, you’re usually gonna have a bad time.2. The core language is very simple; in general there are three kinds of things that matter: values, types, and modules. All values have a type, and all values and types are defined in modules.3. It’s very easy to nest let bindings in order to help localize the scope of intermediate values.4. It has a very fast compiler with separate compilation. The dev cycle is usually very tight (oftentimes practically instantaneous).5. Most of the language encourages good practice through sane defaults, but accessing escape hatches to do “dirty” things is very easy to do.6. The compiler has some restrictions which may seem arcane, such as the value restriction and weak type variables, but they are valuable in preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot, and they enable some other useful features of the language such as local mutation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe OCaml's syntax does suck, but I don’t think this article gives a compelling argument as to why. Missing an `in` turns a let expression into a top level binding and kicks a syntax error often a long way down the file, making it very hard to identify the cause. The relative precedence of let, if, match, fun, and the semicolon is unintuitive and hard to remember, making me want to add loads of unnecessary and ugly parentheses.On the other hand, I like that there's little overloaded syntax, and the meaning of different characters is fairly consistent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182620</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the significance of small brain networks in processing information and executing complex behaviors. It highlights how these networks, often overlooked in favor of larger brain structures, play a crucial role in the efficiency and adaptability of cognitive functions. The piece delves into various studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these small networks in both humans and animals, underscoring their potential in understanding brain disorders and informing neuroscience research. Ultimately, it advocates for a re-evaluation of the importance of small-scale neural connections in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing to mention is that as far as I know, biological neurons are much more complex than artificial ones. They spike and have a lot more internal states (I think).I wonder if we might see more neuromorphic AI hardware (at competitive scale) soon in order to get away from the extreme energy requirements by (hopefully) packing more capability into fewer artificial neurons and/or a more efficient implementation of the neurons.Every time I see another headline about the plans for giant AI datacenters I expect the next one to be about memristors or some new paradigm with a huge investment coming out of a lab and into a competitive chip. I think that every dollar that goes into a giant AI datacenter should be matched with trying to make new hardware paradigms for AI competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they track the brain activity of a fruit fly? That seems incredible to me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The scientists monitored the brains of fruit flies as they walked on tiny rotating foam balls in the dark, and recorded the activity of a network of cells responsible for keeping track of head direction.Meanwhile I chimp out when I have to plug 4 wires in a relay module.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42170721</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common misconceptions surrounding employee performance and how it is often related to innate capabilities rather than external factors. It emphasizes the importance of considering the context in which employees work, including management practices, team dynamics, and organizational culture, which can significantly impact performance outcomes. The author argues for a more holistic approach to evaluating employee performance that takes these elements into account, rather than relying solely on individual metrics or evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Performance management, as practiced in many large corporations in 2024, is an outdated technology that is in need of an updateAuthor made a couple of fundamental mistakes: the first is they assume employees are (or should be) paid according to how much they "individually" earned the company. Employers strive to pay employees the minimum they can bear, on employer's terms. Those terms are information asymmetry and a Gaussian distribution. Fairness is the last thing one should expect from employers, but being honest about this is not good for morale, so instead, they rely on keeping employees uninformed, while the employers collude to gather everyone's remuneration history via the Work Number.The second mistake they made is assume that companies would prioritize being lean and trimming the mediocre &amp; bottom 5%. There are other considerations, combined productivity is more important than having individual superstars working on the shiniest features. How much revenue do you think a janitor or café staffer generates? Close to zero. The same goes for engineering. Someone has to do the unglamorous staff, or you end up with a dysfunctional company, with amazing talent (on paper).Edit: there's an infamous graph that shows when aggregate worker productivity and average income. The two tracked closely, rising in tandem until the 1970s, where they got decoupled. With income becoming much flatter, and productivity continuing to rise. That's how the world has been for the past 50 years on the macro and the micro&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"IQ is Gaussian" – it was pointed out somewhere, and only then became obvious to me, that IQ is not Gaussian. The distribution is manufactured.If you have 1000 possible IQ questions, you can ask a bunch of people those questions, and then pick out 100 questions that form a Gaussian distribution. This is how IQ tests are created.This is not unreasonable... if you picked out 100 super easy questions you wouldn't get much information, everyone would be in the "knows quite a lot" category. But you could try to create a uniform distribution, for instance, and still have a test that is usefully sensitive. But if you worry about the accuracy of the test then a Gaussian distribution is kind of convenient... there's this expectation that 50th percentile is not that different than 55th percentile, and people mostly care about that 5% difference only with 90th vs 95th. (But I don't think people care much about the difference between 10th percentile and 5th... which might imply an actual Pareto distribution, though I think it probably reflects more on societal attention)Anyway, kind of an aside, but also similar to what the article itself is talking about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would feel better if this was derived from empirical data rather than just rhetoric.  This seems super testable, no? There is probably a ton of data already in different industries with regards to productivity.Even if human talent have a Pareto distribution (which is not clear), the people employed by a company are a selected sub-set of that population, which would likely have a different distribution depending on how they are selected and the task at hand.I think that any of these simplified distributions are likely not generalizable across companies and industries (e.g. productivity of AWS or Google employees are likely not distributed like employees of MacDonalds or Wal*Mart because of the difference in hiring procedures and the nature of the tasks.)Get hard data within the companies and industry you are in and then you can make some arguments.  Otherwise, I feel it is too easy to just be talking up a sand castle that has no solid footing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42236841</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do something similar, but instead of `insteadOf`, I just clone the repo with `gh-work:org/repo`, and in the git config:    [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:gh-work:**/**"]
        path = ~/.gitconfig.d/gh-work.inc

So, any git repo cloned with the ssh identity defined under `gh-work` will take on the config of `gh-work.inc`, which includes the git identity, and also the same signing key as in the ssh config.Essentially, the name `gh-work` becomes the distinguishing element  in both my ssh identity and my git identity, and I find this easier to think about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to work at a startup with a character who would set his identity to be random fairytale-sounding nonsense, changing every day.  So his commits on Monday would be attributed to Mr. Bunnymann, and Tuesday would be Doctor Funtime, etc.It was super unhelpful when trying to do version control forensics.  But if I'm being generous, I think maybe he was trying to remind everyone that anyone can put anything in their identity config, and we shouldn't trust whatever is in there for all that much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One even-better approach IMHOJust keep a .gitconfig in your HOME with aliases for your identities. Then just after initializing/cloning the repo do git config-company or git config-personal    er453r@r7:~$ cat ~/.gitconfig 
    [user]
        useConfigOnly = true
    [alias]
        config-personal = !echo CONFIG-PERSONAL &amp;&amp; \
            git config --local user.email 'personal@email.com' &amp;&amp; \

&lt;p&gt;Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, is steadily gaining popularity and traction, positioning itself as a significant competitor to Meta's Threads. Users are attracted to Bluesky for its emphasis on privacy, user control, and unique features that distinguish it from traditional social media offerings. As more people seek alternatives to mainstream platforms, Bluesky's growth reflects a broader trend of dissatisfaction with existing social media giants and a desire for more decentralized and user-centric options. The article highlights the factors contributing to Bluesky's rise and its potential to reshape the social media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still feel that an enormous amount of why threads shows up in data analytics is because Instagram just added it on and made an account for everyone.It wasn't adopted, it was falsely created.I'd go even further to say that it isn't a social network, it's an add-on to another social network.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; but now the Bluesky app has exploded to 3.5 million daily active users, putting it just 1.5 times behind Meta’s ThreadsAre they implying that Threads has just ~5 million daily active users? Adam Mosseri shared in the beginning of November that they have 275 million monthly active users. Bluesky meanwhile has 20 million total users. Considering the author hasn't shared a single source for their claim, I find it hard to believe. Realistically he is off by at least an order of magnitude.Mashable used to be one of my go-to blogs, but I haven't been there in a while. Has it really fallen this far?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's inevitable that social media will split up into separate and distinct networks of people who can no longer stand or even undertand the other sociopolitical tribes.All of us sharing a singular global network was an exceptional and ephemeral circumstance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231148</guid></item><item><title>25.

However, I am not trolling but what happens when NextJS is no longer the hot commodity that it is today. I would prefer a Visual CMS that lets me do all this but the output should always be static HTML/CSS/JS. Most tools either do the visual part well but fail at the output or vice versa. I don't mind if the stack is NextJS or whatever but the final output should be a static HTML. Bonus if you can push to deploy to Netlify/Cloudflare Pages/S3 etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope this is the next standard for CMS-style sites. I'm eagerly waiting for the thing that's easy enough for non-coders to use that doesn't make the code-capable maintainers want to cry mercy.I was pretty optimistic about netlify-cms the approach they took just missed the mark on some technical things that NextJS handles as part of the framework.Best of luck!

It is encouraged in Abrahamic religions, but is a core activity in ancient religions like Hinduism, where there are pilgrimage sights dotted all over India (with some lying as far away as Afghanistan). These are like mini quests; you can do this mission where you visit the 11 Krishna sites, or this another mission where you have to reach these 15 sites, but they are all on mountains, and you have to walk 10k steps to reach there...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pilgrimages were still a big thing among early Christians.For example, in Acts 20:16 it notes how Paul was trying to be in Jerusalem for Pentecost.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to cave dive years and years ago and explore dry caves when we lived in the Missouri area. There are a ton of limestone caves there. Many aren't mapped or really marked at all, especially when you get in the bluffs along the Mississippi.I stopped when I got stuck in a tight passage and almost drowned in a flash flood. Caves seem like these super cool places and they're climate controlled so they seemed kind of, I don't know, soft?Then I figured out they're not and they're really really really fucking dangerous. Oh, the stupid stuff 20 year olds get up to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most insane kind of caving I've ever seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOLDGaooQI (cave diving 245 meters deep)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You couldn't pay me enough to squeeze myself in narrow tunnels underground. But I'm glad there are brave explorers who can do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232952</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bah. I thought this was going to be cool passive noise reduction but it’s active.Back in the 90’s someone figured out these little hollow beads that ate sound. They talked about how we could paint them on walls to dampen whole rooms, or things like airplanes.Since we never heard from them again, even after the patents would have expired, I suspect that they couldn’t find a binder that adhered to the beads without filling in the holes. Or the paint neutralizes the effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Sound, an omnipresent sensory stimulator, holds significant relevance in the human experience, as it continually engages our auditory and mental faculties.This first sentence makes it seem as if the paper was written by aliens. Not even deaf people would gain anything from that sentence.I think LLMs have caused me to be more perceptive to and annoyed by stuff like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apologies for the ADHD induced tangent.  Has anyone else noticed that regular little party balloons seem to have a passive noise cancelling effect?  If you bring them close to your ear there's a zone of 'dead air' when they are maybe an inch away.  My theory was that there's something in passing through the rubber envelope that creates a phase delay or inversion, but it could just all be in my head lol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235909</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The Owl Lisp project on GitLab is an open-source framework designed for creating and manipulating symbolic expressions using the Lisp programming language. It focuses on providing a flexible and extensible environment for developers, offering features like a robust macro system, support for various data structures, and integration with other libraries. The project aims to facilitate projects in artificial intelligence and functional programming by streamlining the development process for Lisp-based applications. The repository includes documentation, samples, and resources for users to get started with Owl Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the investigation into IP Edge, a patent-assertion firm often associated with aggressive litigation tactics, revealing findings that could lead to criminal referrals. It highlights a federal judge's concerns over IP Edge's practices, including the use of "patent trolls" to exploit the legal system for financial gain. The investigation's results underline the ongoing challenges posed by patent trolling in the tech industry and point to potential legal consequences for those involved in such predatory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the French Wikipedia:https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_BrevetsFrance Brevets (FB) was an intellectual property investment fund created by the French State, the National Research Agency (ANR), and the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations. The entity was created on June 9, 2011 as a simplified joint-stock company. It received 50 million euros. This capital was subsequently increased to 100 million. Its activity was negotiating the rights to the patents for which it was responsible. In particular, it could gather patents to propose a coherent offer to the lessees, or even look for new areas of use. It was part of the French public policy known as competitiveness clusters, to support the country's industrial activity.Faced with the structure's lack of profitability, pointed out several times by the Court of Auditors, the French State requested the cessation of France Brevets's activity, a decision ratified on October 20, 2022, by the board of directors.France Brevets is criticized for having a "patent troll" type of activity and is taking legal action against companies such as the Taiwanese HTC or the Korean LG without industrial production.In addition, the granting of public subsidies to an SAS would be contrary to Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Therefore the very status of France Brevets would be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19 additional comments here,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42086555&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; France Brevets was set to receive 35% of any revenue related to “monetizing and enforcement” of the patent, with Burley agreeing to file at least one patent infringement lawsuit within a year, and collect a “total minimum Gross Revenue of US $100,000” within 24 months, or the patent rights would be given back to France Brevets.This is insane to me, it sounds almost like the patent holders are leasing out patents to anyone who is willing to work as a patent troll and chance their arm at some payouts, otherwise they have to return the Patent?I mean that just sounds like a new level of low for patent troll farming entirely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234147</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I lived overseas for a time in an area that didn't use English. I loved it, enjoyed being there, but one day I noticed that I was talking to myself! At first, it was just exclamations out loud (quietly) when something happened around me. It progressed to me describing or evaluating my meal, a book, a scene I was looking at. I realized it when I noticed ppl looking at me strangely (they normally did anyway), and as I looked back wondering why they were looking at me, it hit! I had been talking out loud to myself, normal volume! Why? I figure it was loneliness; but loneliness for hearing English. I was the only one who could speak it! And then it hit me again, a new found epiphany about all those "crazy homeless" ppl who I'd seen back home, muttering to themselves as they wander around. What if, instead of (or in addition to) being mentally unwell, they were just lonely, and having no one to talk to led to them talking to themselves? Whoa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who's considered himself lonely for most of his life, I can very much relate with the idea of feeling like an outcast, like an alien, someone who doesn't really fit in or understand what others find interest in. I think, in my case at least, it was probably related to being told over and over as I kid that I was doing everything wrong, that I wasn't acting manly enough, etc. Being told I didn't fit in led me to believe it. After a long journey of rebuilding my self-worth, I'm a lot less lonely this days, but I still feel it pulling at me, especially when I'm in a situation where I feel like an outsider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intuitively, this makes perfect sense.Non-lonely people interact with one another, continuously exposing themselves to each others views and opinions (even if indirectly).A lonely person won't be part of this echo chamber, so their opinions will usually be self-formed and less influenced by the collective opinion of others.It's easy to see how this creates a feedback loop. A lonely person doesn't share as many worldviews with non-lonely people, so has a harder time fitting in, which makes breaking the cycle even harder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234695</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the benefits of using a projector as a replacement for a traditional monitor in a home office setup. It explores how projectors can provide a larger display area, enhance collaboration, and save space. The author shares their personal experience and evaluates various projector models suitable for different needs, emphasizing factors like resolution, brightness, and connectivity. The piece also offers practical tips on setting up a projector effectively, suggesting considerations for lighting and screen placement to optimize the work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

"Xtended Reality" is not really true VR, but instead, simply provides a huge 1080p screen in the middle of your field of vision. They're flawed in a handful of ways, especially with blur/visibility around the edges. I need to increase the font size to read with them. Despite those flaws, it's extremely liberating to be able to position myself in any way I want and still be able to see the main focus of my work. I think I'll just keep investing in glasses like these and never buy another monitor ever again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;isn't 1080p resolution too low for that size?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My experience with projectors is that they are noisy, power hungry beasts with display quality far inferior to monitors. Has that changed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232741</guid></item><item><title>38.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts a pivotal moment in Valve's history when a summer intern played a crucial role in averting a potentially disastrous lawsuit for the company. The intern's quick thinking and timely email communication helped to resolve a conflict with a publisher that had unexpectedly escalated, illustrating the significant impact that an individual can have within a major organization.

In some nearby universe the games industry looks very different and sometimes people go "remember Half-Life? It's a shame Valve went out of business and the sequel was canceled."I wonder what other amazing things we missed out on because of political backstabbing, or one-sided corporate lawsuits, or crime and fraud? We'll never know, because those projects don't get documentaries made about them 20 years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42191328</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on GitHub's roadmap outlines community suggestions and feature requests for improving GitHub's platform, focusing on enhancements to collaboration tools, user interface improvements, and overall usability. Contributors share their insights and recommend changes that could enhance developers' workflows, promote better project management, and facilitate easier communication among users.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is why you don’t announce future changes until they’re essentially ready to go out the door. Apple used to understand this better than most. Until you build the feature, you’ll have people asking you constantly when it’ll be done. After you build it, you’ll have people complaining that it doesn’t work exactly like they imagined it in their head. If you end up not building it and say so, you’ll get attacked for it, even by people who never knew about the plans before the cancellation.Keep quiet about internal plans only you can affect. Let features requests come to you, monitor interest in those, and reply if they’re interesting or not feasible, so you can discuss and figure out what would work best for your users. Engage but don’t commit unless you’re certain something will happen.I’m surprised the conversation hasn’t devolved to a bigger mess yet (maybe it’s being well moderated). It’s a shame they’re having to preemptively lock issues, but I completely get it. It’s exhausting having to deal with abuse on public forums when you’re on the receiving end and always have to keep your conposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only one that directly annoys me is not being able to have threaded comments at the PR level. https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/552 You can do it with "quoting", which is fine if there are two of you but turns into a mess if there's more than that.They've said that they're watching the discussions for feedback, so I hope they listen and implement that one.Happy that they are being transparent (rather than letting the issues rot), annoyed that they appear to be prioritising marginally useful AI stuff for basic UX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going to stick my neck out here.A lot of these "improvements" fall into the following 3 categories:1) More complexity around issue tracking2) More complexity around permissions3) IDE-ness and general visual-studioification of the web interface.Since many of the issues make GitHub bloated and more difficult to use for general use cases, they _should_ be removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234415</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept that there are hidden or obscured narratives throughout history that have significant implications for our understanding of the world. It delves into various events, figures, and philosophies that have been overlooked or misrepresented in mainstream historical discourse. The piece highlights the importance of re-examining these narratives to gain a fuller understanding of human civilization and cultural heritage. It encourages readers to consider alternative perspectives on history that challenge conventional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

To keep the city at bay he employed his own private police force and set up toll gates, which is where we get the name Brooks Bar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This was simply how cities worked: the elite in the centre, the poor on the outskirts.That checks out today as well - at least in Europe. Difference being that we have mass transit now, so everything close to stops is also more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"""
developers were coming in with proposals to demolish the Victorian villas in the area so that they could build apartments. We decided to designate it as a conservation area so that nothing could be knocked down without our permission.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the process of converting video files into different formats using the free and open-source tools provided by the Xiph organization. It focuses on video compression techniques and the use of the Ogg container format in relation to various video codecs, emphasizing the importance of preserving video quality while achieving smaller file sizes. Additionally, it provides practical guidance on encoding video for optimal playback across different devices and platforms, highlighting the benefits of using open standards in multimedia.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a very infuential video. I often see it referenced when digital audio gets explained.It is also very insiduously misleading in a way that is hard to fault it for.That "band limited signal" that uniquely satisfies Niquist theorem? That is an infinite, periodic signal.No finite (e. g. a song), aperiodic signal can be band limited. That includes any signal with transients.Well, how big is the difference? How much overhead/error/lookahead is needed to approach the Niquist result? It is never mentioned by people referring to this theorem when talking about audio signal sampling!And I wish it was mentioned and explained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A classic. I wish Xiph developed Daala into a fully functional video codec.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183173</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses whether identification is necessary to read the REAL ID regulations, highlighting that while no ID is required to access the rules themselves, understanding and compliance with them may necessitate verifying identity for some individuals. It emphasizes the importance of awareness regarding ID requirements for air travel and federal facilities, and outlines the various scenarios where identification becomes crucial. The piece ultimately clarifies the distinction between accessing information and the need for ID in different contexts related to REAL ID enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really admire these folks for standing on a worthy principle. I also dig the performance art vibe of showing up at the TSA headquarters without an ID to read a deeply nested tree of paper documents about IDs. If you're going to joust windmills, these are some good windmills to joust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; These mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) will be issued by state driver’s license agencies, but the standards incorporated into the TSA rule require that they be deployed through smartphone platforms (i.e. Google and/or Apple) and operate through government apps that collect photos of users and log usage of these credentials.This is really disturbing in a number of different ways.  It's bad enough to have the government requiring you to have a government-approved smart phone, but on top of that it's the logging and data analysis wet dream that authoriarian governments the world over could have only dreamed of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos to Mr. Hasbrouck, who I assume is the narrator, for putting feet to ground to demonstrate the lack of open access to executive branch law.You can't have a law, and also keep it secret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239952</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of meritocracy in college admissions and how it contributes to social and economic segregation. It critiques the notion that merit-based systems are fair, pointing out that access to resources, opportunities, and quality education is often unevenly distributed, favoring affluent students. The piece argues for a reevaluation of admissions processes to better account for students' varied backgrounds and to promote equity in higher education, ultimately questioning the ideals of meritocracy in a deeply unequal society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long essay, but I agree with a lot of what's said.I think a lot of quality time is wasted due to the rat race starting in early childhood.I live in a bit of a bubble in the commuter belt around London (ie not the US), but I observe some of the same obsessions here as well. In particular, I started to notice that my kid's friends suddenly had a lot less time for playdates in the year or two leading up to the 11-plus exam, which is a selective school thing. There are similar exams for the private schools in the area. Of course what was happening was that their parents would hire a tutor to help them pass the tests.The effect of this tutoring is on the whole negative. Obviously, it costs money. It also costs time that your kid would have to do other things. But also, it gives the kids the impression that school is super important, and they will be valued based on the outcome of this test. You end up with a few percent who get into the top selective schools, and everyone else is left with low expectations.Inevitably, it also means that it becomes a game for rich parents. I went to the induction day at the fancy school, and guess what. The parents are a bunch of professionals, virtually nobody doing anything else, and most kids went to private primaries + got tutored. We must have left some poor but capable kids in the wrong school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Number one people go to number one schools” is how one lawyer explained her firm’s recruiting principle to Rivera.What a load of number two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something missing is deindustrialization following WW2. The US northeast (where "Ivy League" schools are located) shifted a huge amount of industry to other parts of the country, where factories had been established during the war. A few years later, the south had more electoral votes than the northeast and midwest. The votes determine leaders, not educational institutions.Look at the electoral votes from 1956:NY: 45 
PA: 32 
TX: 24 
FL: 10Today:NY: 28 
PA: 19 
TX: 40 
FL: 30Texas and Florida doubled their influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233651</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;World Time App provides users with the current time and time zone information for any location around the globe. It features a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to easily look up local times, check time differences between various cities, and stay updated on daylight saving time changes. The site is useful for travelers, businesses coordinating international meetings, or anyone needing to keep track of global time zones.&lt;/p&gt;

I wish it would be possible to reorder the locations so that they can be offsetted correctly. Eg. for me Sydney is the first column. Then New York and I added Bangkok. Bangkok is closer to me timezone wise (i.e. they are a few hours behind) where as New York is nearly a day behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice if this supported continents beyond the following (taken from the source code):- Europe- North America- Asia- Additional cities in Oceania- Additional cities in Africa- Additional cities in South America- Additional cities in North America- Additional cities in Japan- Additional cities in South KoreaIf you live in a city of more than a few hundred thousand in Africa, Oceania, or China, you're out of luck!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231754</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a recently declassified Pentagon report that reveals significant reliability and security issues associated with the F-35 fighter jet. It highlights concerns about the aircraft's maintenance needs, performance in combat scenarios, and vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The report emphasizes the ongoing challenges in ensuring the F-35 meets its operational goals and sheds light on broader implications for military readiness and defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the prevalent belief in a "loneliness epidemic" in modern society, arguing that while loneliness is indeed a significant issue, the notion that it has reached unprecedented levels is misleading. The author examines various studies and cultural narratives surrounding loneliness, suggesting that social isolation may not be as widespread as claimed. Moreover, the piece highlights the complexity of loneliness and social connection, emphasizing the importance of community and relationship quality over sheer numbers of social interactions. Ultimately, it encourages a nuanced understanding of loneliness rather than a simplistic interpretation of its prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article seems to a lot of fluff, but one thing I generally dislike in arguments is pulling some historical period, quoting similar complaints from that time, and using this to imply that because a problem has existed before it's the norm.History has had many ups and down, and instead of saying that anything is "normal", you should ask if those periods really were downturns that needed solutions.Societies have always had issues, but that doesn't mean that the issues we have right now are not something to be addressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2021 US census found that the average American spent 2 hours 45 minutes with their friends per week. A decade before that it was 6.5. It's probably been replaced by online interaction, but it is online interaction that feels so lonely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article pokes holes and casts doubt on a concept of a loneliness epidemic, just to conclude, "Americans have been repeatedly warned about loneliness and about the loss of friendship. The alarms, of course, may not always be false. History might prove the 2010s to be one of those times where there was some reason for concern — at least about young men." And then "...because false alarms come with a price, particularly in diverting our attention from other, less amorphous matters, such as economic dislocations, violence, and real epidemics."If you put the bottom line up front, the rest of the article doesn't support that conclusion. It doesn't address the resources that we're spending on loneliness, or what's a better use of those resources.There's another swing and a miss for the conclusion a little earlier too. "If there has been increasing chatter about loneliness, then, it has been more the result of higher expectations and greater self-reflection — especially among the chattering classes — rather than greater isolation."So people aren't more lonely, they just feel more lonely. But that's not true loneliness. Again, you could write an interesting article on that, but this article isn't.This article ultimately comes off as a call to inaction because the alternative is believing there's a loneliness epidemic and being tempted to do something about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42238160</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to resign from the Royal Society, outlining various reasons behind this choice. The author expresses concerns about the organization's lack of transparency, its handling of scientific debates, and issues related to inclusivity and diversity. They feel that the society has strayed from its mission to promote science and that these changes have impacted their ability to contribute effectively. The resignation serves as a personal statement on the need for scientific institutions to uphold their core values and advocate for open dialogue in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I respect the author's principle-based approach but many of her arguments seem a little off. If the RS doesn't expel people for their politics, then it doesn't make sense to expel Musk for, essentially, concerns about his politics. And if you expel crotchety scientists for disagreeing with the scientific consensus there won't be any left. The RS motto is literally "Take nobody's word for it"; I don't see how Musk disagreeing with other's opinions could possibly be grounds for removing him.That being said, Musk does seem like a vaguely inappropriate addition to the Society. His wikipedia page suggests he doesn't have a PhD, doesn't do any research and is involved in military matters for an army foreign to the UK. He's obviously being included because he has lots of money and it isn't clear to me if that is proper or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To quote him "Whereas previously he seemed to agree with mainstream scientific opinion"
Can someone please explain to me how we managed to get a whole generation of the western scientific thinkers who think the scientific method is consensus of scientific opinion? The author lists Isaac Newton, Hooke, Boyle . All of these prominent minds made scientific breakthroughs that didn't stick to the consensus views of the time.People interested should look at The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Kuhn.To quote from Wikipedia:
Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of conceptual continuity and cumulative progress, referred to as periods of "normal science", were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All politics aside, is it normal for business people to be elected to the royal society?Even if you think Musk is a genius, it seems hard to label him as a scientist (instead of a CEO of science-related companies).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234497</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a culinary challenge known as the "onion problem," presented by chef J. Kenji López-Alt, which relates to the best way to cook onions for optimal flavor. The author proposes a solution that involves a method for caramelizing onions more efficiently and effectively, suggesting different cooking techniques and times that enhance the sweetness and depth of flavor without burning. The article emphasizes the science behind cooking techniques and offers practical tips for home cooks to achieve the perfect onion dish.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone, the author of the blog here. I'm glad to see the interest here on this piece!I have slides that detail the problem setup and the mathematics, as well as a consideration of three-dimensional onions, here: https://drspoulsen.github.io/Onion_Marp/index.htmlI have submitted a formal write-up of the details of the problem and the solution to a recreational mathematics journal.I'm also happy to answer any questions about this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; First, we model the onion as half of a disc of radius one, with its center at the origin and existing entirely in the first two quadrants in a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system.Can someone explain to me why a half sphere (the shape of half an onion) can be modeled as a half-disk in this problem? Why would we expect the solutions to be the same? If you think about the outermost cross-sections at the ends of the onion (closest to the heel and tip of the knife), as you get closer and closer to the ends, you approach cutting these cross-sections more vertically. I'd expect that you'd have to make the center cross-section a bit shallower to "make up" for the fact that the outsides are being cut vertically. Idk, either way I think declaring this the true "Onion constant" is probably wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, fellow food youtuber Adam Ragusea swears by the importance of heterogeneity.  Optimizing for uniformity might not be the best strategy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cWRCldqrxM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244814</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has introduced new functionality for Amazon S3 that enables conditional writes, allowing users to specify conditions under which an object will be added or modified in an S3 bucket. This feature enhances data integrity by ensuring that updates occur only if certain predefined criteria are met, such as checking object existence or comparing versions. It is particularly useful for scenarios requiring data versioning and conflict avoidance. The update aims to improve operational efficiency and reliability for applications relying on S3 for object storage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah so its not only me that uses AWS primitives for hackily implementing all sorts of synchronization primitives.My other favorite pattern is implementing a pool of workers by quering ec2 instances with a certain tag in a stopped state and starting them.
Starting the instance can succeed only once - that means I managed to snatch the machine. If it fails, I try again, grabbing another one.This is one of those things that I never advertised out of professional shame, but it works, its bulletproof and dead simple and does not require additional infra to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also possible to enforce the use of conditional writes: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3...My biggest wishlist item for S3 is the ability to enforce that an object is named with a name that matches its hash. (With a modern hash considered secure, not MD5 or SHA1, though it isn't supported for those either.) That would make it much easier to build content-addressible storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To avoid any dependencies other than object storage, we've been making use of this in our database (turbopuffer.com) for consensus and concurrency control since day one.  Been waiting for this since the day we launched on Google Cloud Storage ~1 year ago. Our bet that S3 would get it in a reasonable time-frame worked out!https://turbopuffer.com/blog/turbopuffer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42240678</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The project "jekyll-sqlite" is a Jekyll plugin designed to enable users to integrate SQLite databases into their Jekyll sites. It allows for the querying of SQLite databases and embedding the results in Jekyll-generated pages, facilitating the use of dynamic content that can be stored in a database. The repository provides installation instructions, usage examples, and additional resources for developers looking to enhance their Jekyll projects with database capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice! Great to see innovation in the Jekyll space.Quick FYI on Jekyll performance:I noticed slow generation times on one of my sites and traced it to a plugin that was spawning a git process to get the last commit info for every page. I wrote a drop-in replacement called jekyll-last-commit[0] that uses the ruby libgit2 wrapper for improved performance. Details on its origins are in an old HN comment[1] if you are interested![0]: https://github.com/klandergren/jekyll-last-commit[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34331663&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always been a big fan of Jekyll because it’s so easy to use &amp; so stable. This adds a lot of value to the ecosystem. I’ve built a bunch of faculty websites over the years where I needed a lot of structured, repetitive data (papers, honors/awards, etc.). It would have been so much easier to manage if I could have stored that data in a database instead of just flat files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be old fashioned but this seems like something static site generators shouldn’t do.I can see how someone is grabbing it and regenerating content on data change and then if data changes often enough you are back to dynamic templating engines. Then nagging how awful it is for such use case and staring to build „new thing” that was already in RoR or else.If you have data in a database most likely better to use RoR or whatever else you fancy.But hey this might still be useful for some one off jobs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244987</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a method for devirtualization in the LLVM compiler infrastructure, which aims to optimize code by replacing virtual function calls with direct calls whenever possible. It outlines the challenges and techniques involved in implementing devirtualization, highlighting the importance of using type information and program analysis to make informed decisions. The piece also emphasizes the advantages of this optimization for improving performance and efficiency in compiled programs, ultimately presenting LLVM's capabilities in enhancing the execution speed of applications through intelligent code transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In compiler context, "devirtualization" I encountered usually meant compiling a virtual call to a direct call. See for example "Devirtualization in LLVM and Clang" on LLVM blog: https://blog.llvm.org/2017/03/devirtualization-in-llvm-and-c...."Devirtualization" in this post is something different, being an inverse of virtualization which is an obfuscation technique to hinder reverse engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't recommend using the term "devirtualization" here, as that term has been used to refer simplifying C++ virtual function calls (into normal function call) in LLVM. And such optimization has been turned on by default for quite some time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, a lot of the techniques this article describes are also used in fuzzing. I wonder how much overlap there is between fuzzing and devirtualization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245170</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't use the term "hunt" in the name, to me it just screams "dupe" instead of something unique. Go the route of improving what PH has and adding things that are missing.Some ideas:   
- Users should be able to update their post to some extent.- There's no "product page" in your app, build something where I can see people commenting, reacting, and maybe even sharing their own screenshots of it because that's something PH does pretty well but can be improved.- "LAUNCHES WORTH YOUR SCROLL" sounds kinda cringe, change to something like "Find the next best thing" or make it random on load and have a few less in your face versions of it. Reddit has "homepage of the internet" which seems appropriate. You can have "have you launched yet?", "find the next best thing", "what's trending today"...etcI have more ideas, feel free to message me or drop a way to contact you if you'd like more feedback :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When one builds a Product Hunt (PH) alternative, one needs to remember that PH succeeded because of Ryan Hoover. Just as with any new Startup App/Website of that time, it was not fancy, interesting or likable at all. Ryan’s shouts, marketing, and his everything everywhere all at once presence made PH. When I think of PH, I remember his avatar (profile picture); that 'P' reminds me more of Pinterest than PH.PH is a successful directory-listing-ish website, there is always a limit to its success. Ryan, being a super smart founder, realizes that and moves out at the perfect time at its super-high hype cycle.All PH-esque clones can focus on specific niches and become good lifestyle businesses. Like other business ideas, shred apart Craigslist and build PH of them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What problem does PH solve/what problem would this solve?Honestly PH always felt to me like a time waster. “Oh look at this idea. Neat. Next.”Now, a website where I can type in the problem I am having and it suggests solutions (with a mix of self hosted vs commercial products depending on my settings) would be super useful. For example: “I want to organize a library full of old photos that don’t have metadata” or “I want a cheap online backup solution with support for Linux servers” or “I want to automate sending personalized-feeling birthday cards to people I know professionally”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42238396</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the cultural significance and practice of "setelinleikkaus," which refers to the traditional custom in Finland of snipping or cutting banknotes as a form of protest against economic issues or to symbolize a personal expression of financial hardship. It explores the historical context of this practice, its psychological impacts on individuals participating in it, and how it reflects broader societal attitudes towards money and economic struggles in Finland. The author analyzes the implications of such actions on the perception of currency and the emotional weight that financial transactions hold in personal and societal contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's not just the size of Operation Gutt that is striking to the modern eye. It's also the oddity of the tool being used. Today, we control inflation with changes in interest rates, not changes in the quantity of money. To soften the effect of the global COVID monetary overhang, for instance, central banks in the U.S., Canada, and Europe began to raise rates in 2022 from around 0% to 4-5% in 2024.It's a bit more interesting than 'the central bank sets interest rates'.Simplified: the central bank decide on an interest rate that they want to see. By itself that decision doesn't do anything.What happens next is that they buy and sell government bonds in the open market.  The interest rate can be seen as the inverse of the price of bonds.If the central bank wants to see a lower interest rate, they buy bonds with freshly printed money to drive up their prices, ie drive down the interest rate.If the central banks wants to increase the prevailing interest rate, they sell government bonds from their inventory and essentially destroy they money they receive in return.So even when the language of modern central banking talks about interest rates, they still change the quantity of money to implement that.(This is all simplified, especially with the interest on excess reserves that was popular with the Fed for a while.  And there's also repos and reverse repos etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fascinating piece of financial history I hadn't heard about. Imagine your government telling you to literally take scissors to your money, it's like a weird mix between arts &amp; crafts hour and monetary policy. Though I suppose we're already halfway there with our modern central banks, just without the satisfying snip-snip sounds.The Finnish experiment failing because people just deposited their cash in banks first is a classic example of Goodhart's Law in action. Or as I like to call it, "If you tell people you're going to cut their money in half, they'll find a way to keep it whole."What's really interesting is Belgium's more successful approach, they went full scorched earth on 2/3 of their money supply and somehow managed to pull off an economic miracle. Makes our current inflation-fighting tools look rather tame in comparison. "Sorry, best we can do is nudge interest rates up a quarter point at a time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So it would seem that the whole operation failed. This surely draws into question the quantity theory of money, one of the basic tenets of monetary economics. A decline in the money supply, all things staying the same, is supposed to cause a fall in prices. Here is a glaring case in which it didn't.Anthropologist Christoffer Gregory (backed up by the Swedish central bank and others) posits a companion to the quantity theory of money, which is the quality theory of money. Gregory studied how it is that people come to value the things they do[1] and brings up several clear cases where people don't value money as highly as they should according to domninant theory.Is it possible that this Gutt operation had a negative effect on the perceived quality of Belgian currency, that this decreased demand for it, and thus lowered its value enough to offset the effect of the reduction in supply?Seems sensical to me that if people worry about the government cutting their notes in half they will request more notes in exchange for another commodity than if they had more faith in the currency.[1]: https://entropicthoughts.com/book-review-savage-money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243755</guid></item><item><title>7.

My prayer rug has tessellation patterns, probably a testament to God's infiniteness.Where I'm originally from in Diyarbakir, Turkey, the Christians also use prayer rugs when prostrating (to, I think, Jerusalem) so this isn't an exclusively "Islamic" thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In ancient times Hindus had a prayer mat made of kuusha or kaasha grass. Apparently the grass descended from the hairs of the boar incarnation. So this notion of a seat in worship is indeed very ancient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all the years of using one I never thought it made anything sacred. It keeps my forehead clean and cushions my knees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239487</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article from TechCrunch discusses findings from data that indicate Y Combinator frequently invests in startups that replicate existing ideas or products from other Y Combinator-backed companies, extending beyond just AI and code editors. This trend raises questions about the innovation landscape within the accelerator, suggesting an environment where duplication of concepts may be encouraged or at least tolerated, potentially impacting the diversity of new ideas being brought to market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; YC startups don’t have to be unique. Far from it.Slow news day. YC has made it clear over the years it's almost all about the founders not the idea. It's almost impossible to know if an idea is good at the early stages, and ideas change, startups pivot, often the timing is wrong, and the market unproven etc. More often than not most of what startups do is not unique, otherwise there's no market for it. A new take on an old idea has a much higher chance of success than something totally new that ends up being too early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there's something missing from this analysis - YC companies might duplicate one another's products but that doesn't say anything at all about their target markets, route to market, product focus, etc.As an example, my first startup was a requirements management app that, on paper at least, was a copy of IBM DOORS. Except DOORS is a massive enterprise app targeted at companies who are building a new airplane that has 250,000 technical requirements that need fully traceability, and my app was aimed at small businesses doing software projects with 1000 requirements. I was not competing with IBM; I was trying to apply the value of that app to much smaller projects (the end goal might have been to become a competitor one day but we failed long before then.)You can't just say "These two products do the same thing so the companies are dupes." It's far more complicated than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If nothing else, having competition helps validate the market.Which is often an advantage to all companies involved - a lot of the time, you're only notionally competing with each other, your main enemy is "people not using a product in that space at all."e.g. for a lot of business SaaS the only enemy worth caring about is Excel.(I've more than once been involved with companies where the "competitors" were all on friendly terms because convincing people that using *some* product in that space was a good idea expanded everybody's addressable market)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243746</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Startup owner using AI with this need - needless to say, a real problem. I've considered DIYing an internal service for this - even if we went with you we'd probably have an intern do a quick and dirty copy, which I rarely advocate for if I can offload to SAAS. I'm sure you've put a fair bit of work into this that goes well beyond the human interaction loop, but that's really all we need. Your entry price is steep (I'm afraid to ask what an enterprise use-case looks like) and this isn't complicated to make. We don't need to productize or have all the bells and whistles - just human interaction occasionally. Any amount of competition would wipe out your pricing, so no I would not want to pay for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I assume your reasoning is something like: if people are already paying out the nose for open AI calls, an extra ten cents to make a human in the loop check probably isn't bad, and realistically speaking ten cents isn't much when compared to a valuable person's time, and I guess the number of calls to your service is likely expected to be fairly low (since they by definition require human intervention) so you need a high per operation cost to make anything.Even understanding that, the per operation cost seems astronomical and I imagine you'll have a hard time getting people past that knee jerk reaction. Maybe you could do something like offer a large initial number of credits (like a couple hundred), offer some small numbers of free credits per month (like.... ten?) and then have some tier in between free and premium with lower per operation pricing?It also seems painful that the per operation average of the premium plan is greater than the free offering (when using 2000 ops). Imo you'd probably be better off making it lower than the free offering from 200 ops and up, to give people an incentive to switch. I imagine people on your premium plan using premium features would be more likely to continue to do so, for one. The simplest way to do this would be to bump up the included ops up to 5k I guess. Someone using less than 5k would still have a higher average price, but it seems like it would come off better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting tool, congrats on the launch!I was wondering: have you thought about automation bias or automation complacency [0]? Sticking with the drop-tables example: if you have an agent that works quite well, the human in the loop will nearly always approve the task. The human will then learn over time that the agent "can be trusted", and will stop reviewing the pings carefully. Hitting the "approve" button will become somewhat automated by the human, and the risky tasks won't be caught by the human anymore.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42247368</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential of mining asteroids as a source of food for future space missions. It explores various methods by which asteroids could provide essential nutrients and materials to sustain astronauts during long-duration space travel. The authors emphasize the importance of developing technologies for extracting organic compounds from asteroids and highlight the sustainability and practicality of using these extraterrestrial resources to address food security in space exploration. Overall, the article presents a forward-thinking approach to ensuring nutrition for human life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"but there are substantial areas of future work."Well, yes.Most plant mass comes from air and water, not the ground. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen all come from the atmosphere. This is why farms don't dig themselves into the ground.
If air and water can be made from asteroids, that's most of the raw materials problem by quantity. Hydroponics already works.Direct synthesis of food from hydrocarbons has never really caught on, although it's been done experimentally and is an area of active research.[1] DARPA has a project.[2] "To address vulnerabilities in food supply chains across a variety of operational and humanitarian scenarios, Cornucopia will demonstrate the capacity to produce all four human dietary macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat, and dietary fiber) in ratios that target Military Dietary Reference Intake (MDRI) daily requirements for complete nutrition. Outputs will be in multiple food formats (e.g., shake, bar, gel, jerky) that meet military nutritional standards and palatability requirements in a system minimizing inputs, handling, and footprint."[1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S09242...[2] https://www.darpa.mil/program/cornucopia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose the next step beyond vegetarianism and veganism will be mineralism: Food using molecules certified never to have been part of any known living organism.I remember there was a fictional advertisement for such a product in a sci-fi story, but not exactly where.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For my Factorio friends out there, this sounds like grounds for a mod that let's you "mine" nutrients in space&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244003</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses two prominent memory models in computer science: the Sequential Consistency (SC) model and the Relaxed Memory model. It explains the fundamental principles of each model, focusing on how they handle the sequencing of operations and visibility of memory changes across different processors. The Sequential Consistency model enforces a strict order of execution, ensuring that all operations appear to occur in a single, global sequence, which simplifies reasoning about program behavior but can lead to performance bottlenecks. In contrast, Relaxed Memory models allow for more flexibility and optimization in handling operations, which can lead to increased performance but requires more intricate reasoning and understanding of potential anomalies in program behavior. The article aims to provide clarity on these models and their implications for programming and system design.&lt;/p&gt;

When dereferencing a handle pointer, the compiler emitted code that would swap in the necessary page from expanded memory, extended memory, or disk.It works like a virtual memory system, except that the compiler emitted the necessary code rather than the CPU doing it in microcode.https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/handle-pointers.htmlSimilarly, Zortech C++ had the "VCM" memory model, which worked like virtual memory. Your code pages would be swapped in an out of memory as needed.https://digitalmars.com/ctg/vcm.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's at least one more "fun" aspect to DOS memory - Borland's Turbo Pascal overlay files: https://secondboyet.com/articles/publishedarticles/theslithy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42222670</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of personal identity and the philosophical implications of how identity can be understood, particularly in relation to memory and experience. It explores theories of selfhood, including the continuity of personal experiences, and challenges traditional notions of identity by delving into how changes over time affect one's sense of self. The writing encourages readers to reflect on their own identity and the factors that contribute to its formation and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a fun article, but the whole "dependency resolution problem" is a bit of a wild goose chase anyway, because the underlying data you're basing it all on (what package authors publish as their version constraints) is only slightly better than junk. For a start, python (like most ecosystems) is very limited in its ability to express compatibility constraints - it's not even able to understand the concept of stable branches that receive backports.Add to that most package authors putting about a second's thought into their version constraints, with other package authors being overzealous and for example thinking it's their duty to protect you from security vulnerabilities through their version constraints, and I frequently doubt the worth of putting all this SAT wizardry into these tools, as fun as it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if pip had a SAT solver as a dependency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the opposite possible? I mean to have the dependency resolver use a sat solver? Would it be faster/slower?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231876</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In such a way, Leibniz, to cite Milton, dared to “justify the ways of God to men.” Voltaire responded with a snarky misreading that exploited the undeniable empirical fact that evil was not balanced by good in the lives of every discreet individual. But Leibniz made no such claim. The best world was optimized as a whole, containing just as much good and evil as was required for the totality of creation.I like this paragraph. I've never been a big fan of Voltaire's criticism (although I may have not understood it fully, not being a philosophy expert of any kind). To me it always seemed like Liebniz tried to explain why there was suffering on the whole, and Voltaire responding with "there is suffering!". Like you are not really arguing the point.My question has rather been that, if suffering is required and a child getting bone cancer and dying at five is the best of all possible worlds, maybe the whole project should have been scrapped at the planning phase. I assume God was not forced to create a world?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Leibniz challenged “humanity to participate in the work of striving toward perfection,”&gt; Because the world is the creation of a perfect being, it can achieve only the “best possible” state short of divine perfection.That's a lot of presumptions: That the creator is perfect, there is even a perfect, what I (Leibniz) call perfect is the god's/gods' perfect, ... while not giving a frame of reference.I find this a common theme for those who are struggling to marry religious beliefs with logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; A key to Leibniz’s view is symmetry of creation. The best only emerges against the worst, the beautiful against the ugly, the harmonious against the dissonant.Leibniz's surviving corpus is massive and sprawling (far larger than any other member of the Republic of Letters) so it could be that i haven't read whatever this is a reference to, but I don't recognise this sense of balance. For Leibniz as i understand him ours is the best of possible worlds because God created it to be this way, in his infinite benevolence and wisdom, and whatever the calamities occur must be part of some kind of plan of which we can only be ken (apperceptive) to a fraction thereof.Reading Leibniz is like standing at the gate of modern and medieval thought. He didn't so much 'ransack' ideas, as this piece says he does, as try to reconcile even the most contradictory of positions. It's odd but exquisite.If anyone wants to jump in I would recommend Lloyd Strickland's annotated translation of the Monadology (Leibniz's Monadology). Or really anything by Strickland, including his book on Leibniz on binary. See Strickland's website: http://www.leibniz-translations.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42197886</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article titled "Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning" discusses a novel unsupervised learning approach for video representation using contrastive learning techniques. The authors propose a method that effectively captures temporal and spatial features from videos by employing a framework that distinguishes between similar and dissimilar video clips. They demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing methods on various video understanding tasks, indicating its potential for advancing the field of video representation learning without the need for labeled data. The findings highlight the benefits of contrastive learning in improving the quality of learned video representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the life and significance of James Wells, an influential figure in the field of education and philosophy. It explores his contributions to teaching methods, his philosophical perspectives on education, and the impact of his work on both students and educators. The text emphasizes Wells' belief in the importance of critical thinking and the need to cultivate curiosity and creativity in students. Overall, it highlights how his ideas continue to resonate in contemporary educational practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wells was way above James in quality, prolific output and wide ranging genres, from sci-fi to history, fiction and social reform - his life story is worth studying carefully. His work even led towards the atomic bomb and statute of human rights.Dream boldly and build responsibly - https://onepercentrule.substack.com/p/hg-wells-dream-boldly-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; His [Wells'] novels are not social novels at all.The science fiction novels for which Wells is best known form a small part of his fiction output, and are from early in his career. Most of his ca. 50 novels are "social", propagandistic and dull, and known mostly to literature professors.As for Wells' non-fiction work, all I can say is don't confuse "opinionated" with "knowledgeable". Wells was a prolific writer but not a careful scholar. He was at one point failed out of college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's only fair to include James's response to Wells.'It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance, for our consideration and application of those things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of the process.'I haven't read enough of either author to have an opinion on their relative literary merit, but James is right about that, at the very least.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245562</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This feels like an incredibly elaborate way to say that he's a morning person. There's plenty of people for whom the entire thing works the exact opposite, and of course loads of people everywhere in between. I wouldn't really read deep into this, it's one of those takes that tries really hard to sound profound, but it really isn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is good advice, though people are getting distracted by the unnecessary morning/evening talk.This is a real problem for people who have a habit of reading a lot of news and social media first thing in the morning. Some people show up to work having consumed hours of the latest rage-bait on Reddit, sky-is-falling takes on Twitter, and news about the latest wars, disasters, and political problems. They’re emotionally and mentally burdened before they even get started on work.It often manifests as people claiming they don’t have any time to do anything outside of their 40 hour work weeks. I’ve mentored several early 20s people working relatively easy jobs, having no significant other or kids, and no real obligations who lament how they never have time or energy to do anything after working 40 hour jobs. Every single time having them check their screen time stats results in eye-popping amounts of Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, and other endless streams of stress and ragebait content. Putting a 30 minute limit on these apps with their phone’s built-in tools can work wonders on fixing their lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For someone who suffers from anxiety like myself, and therefore empathizes well with the perspective in the article (i.e. an emotionally-charged event can have an impact on my productivity):I think a better approach is to focus on becoming emotionally resilient so that things don't overwhelm so easily, or so it's possible to reset even given an emotional challenge. At least, that has been critical in my life to avoid spirals of self-recrimination or agonizing over things I can't affect or control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212909</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the experience of a journalist whose position was replaced by an artificial intelligence reporter, highlighting the initial excitement about AI technology in journalism and the subsequent reality of its limitations. It also reflects on the implications of relying on AI for newswriting, as the AI was ultimately let go due to its inability to meet quality standards. The piece raises questions about the future role of human journalists in an increasingly automated industry and the challenges of integrating AI effectively while preserving journalistic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly tangential, but this is the reason I'm baffled why people think that AI-driven podcasts would ever be worth listening to.If you can find an LLM+TTS generated podcast with even a FRACTION of the infectious energy as something like Good Job Brain, Radio Lab, or Ask Me Another, then I'll eat my hat. I don't even own one. I'll drive to the nearest hat store, purchase the tallest stovetop hat that I can afford and eat it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incredibly, no videos linked in an article about a video newscast. I think this is an example. The AI doesn't even pronounce "AI" correctly. Interestingly, it looks slightly offscreen just the way real newsreaders do when they're on prompter.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa7Q2S7VWUkThey do a lot right. There's interaction between the bots. They look kind of professional but not Los Angeles/New York quality, which is what you'd expect from a smallish market. Their movement is also kind of stiff and amateurish, which I believe is intentional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I enjoyed the article, it’s just another in a line of the same article with different flavors and authors that all have the same fundamental error.The prevailing counterargument against AI consistently hinges on the present state of AI rather than the trajectory of its development: but what matters is not the capabilities of AI as they exist today, but the astonishing velocity at which those capabilities are evolving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212650</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the groundbreaking work of teenage mathematicians who explored mathematical knots through the lens of fractals. These young students engaged in complex research that delves into the intersection of knot theory and fractal geometry, showcasing their findings and contributions to the field. Their innovative approach not only highlights the potential of youthful minds in advanced mathematics but also opens new avenues for understanding and visualizing knots using fractals. This collaboration and exploration illustrate the excitement and depth that can come from youthful inquiry in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and significance of Cyberia, the world's first-ever cyber café, which opened in London in the 1990s. It highlights how Cyberia combined internet access with a social space, attracting a diverse clientele of tech enthusiasts, artists, and students during the early days of the internet. The café became a cultural hub, influencing the development of future internet cafés and contributing to the growth of online communities. The piece also reflects on the nostalgia for a pre-ubiquitous internet era and the unique experience that Cyberia offered before the digital landscape evolved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For what it's worth, there was an earlier "Cyber Cafe" just off the campus of Michigan State University in the early to mid-90s called Emerald City Cafe. They had 128k ISDN connections to MichNet/Merit by 1994 (when I started going there), and by late 1995 had 3MBit TCI Cable Modem connections.It wasn't a nightclub-style cafe like the one in the article, but it was really cozy, open until 11:30pm weeknights (1am weekends), and had excellent coffee. Plus the next room over was an arcade / laundry. It's a bummer I can't find an article about it. Just good memories.https://www.cablevision.co.cr/review/1995/12.htmlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_Network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;And then there was the Amish community in Pennsylvania. Eva had to fly out there to negotiate for the “Cyberia.com” domain name they had bought. “It was a proper barn with horse carts and a wall of modems as they were running a bulletin board and an early ecommerce company. Apparently, there was always one family nominated to be the tech support,” she remembers.That is one of the most profoundly interesting little tidbits of internet history I’ve ever seen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked at Cyberia's second location in Kingston in 1995, before getting hired by Easynet to do tech support on the top floor of the building where Cyberia London was located. It was an interesting time! This article captured the energy pretty well - but there was a whole lot going on at Easynet as well at the time, too.FWIW, I think the claim was always that Cyberia was The UK's first internet cafe. At least, that's what I've always said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42218130</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides real-time status updates for Fly.io's services, including information about system performance, outages, and scheduled maintenance. It offers a clear view of the operational status and any ongoing incidents, allowing users to stay informed about the reliability and availability of Fly.io's platform.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My fly.io-hosted website went down for 5 minutes (6 hours ago), but then came right back up, and has been up ever since. I use a free monitoring service that checks it every 5 minutes, so it's possible it missed another short bit of downtime. But fly.io has been pretty reliable overall for me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fly.io publishes their post-mortems here: https://fly.io/infra-log/The last post-mortem they wrote is very interesting and full of details. Basically back in 2016 the heart or keystone component of fly.io production infrastructure was called consul, which is a highly secure TLS server that tracks shared state and it requires that both the server certificate and the client certificate be authenticated. Since it was centralized, it had scaling issues, so fly.io wrote a replacement for it in 2020 called corrosion, and quickly forgot about consul, but didn't have the heart to kill it. Then in October 2024 consul's root key signing key expires, which brought down all connectivity, and since it uses bidirectional authentication, they couldn't bring it back online until they deployed new SSL certificates to every machine in their fleet. Somehow they did this in half an hour, but the chain of dominoes had already been set in motion to reveal other weaknesses in their infrastructure that they could eliminate. There was this other internal service whose own independent set of TLS keys had also expired long ago, but they didn't notice until they tried rebooting it as part of the consul rekey, since doing so severed the TCP connections it had established way back when its certificate was valid. Plus the whole time this is happening, their logging tools are DDOSing their network provider. It took some real heroes to save the company and all their customers too when that many things explode at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fly.io seems to be a bit of a mixed bag:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41917436https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35044516https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34742946https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34229751If a cloud platform doesn't really provide reliability, I'd say it's probably not worth it.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s not just California, but California may be one of the more egregious state neglecters.The push at the state level for policies that focus on equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities will not end well for the gifted and talented communities.Whenever I hear these people talk about their policies, I can’t help but recall Harrison Bergeron.Focusing on equality of outcomes in a society that structurally does not afford equality of opportunities is a fool’s game that ends with Bergeron-esque levels of absurdity.Imho, the only viable/main solution is to acknowledge that we all aren’t equal, we don’t all have access to the same opportunities, but as a country we can implement policies that lessen the imbalance.Head Start is a good example.Well-run gifted and talented programs in schools are also good examples.Killing truly progressive programs for the purpose of virtue signaling is a loss for society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did people read the article? There's actually some interesting points about how gifted/advanced curriculum isn't always the solution. I'd have to agree. I went to a magnet school, so already presumably for "gifted" students, that in turn had advanced courses like honors or AP. And while there were students who genuinely benefited, myself included, it also became a game of getting into the most advanced course so you could have it on your college applications.Also, imo, the vast majority of students did not benefit. It's not like they were all brilliant. They basically passed a standardized test that they spent a few years in prep classes to pass. What this measured was whether your parents were tapped into particular social circles and knew to put you in prep. Once you were in the school, if you wanted good teachers, you had to take honors. I had a fantastic history teacher who talked about how he loved teaching regular history, but he was constantly pressured by administration to only teach AP. So for a lot of students who didn't have the grades to do honors, they got stuck with the mediocre teachers. Not to mention, psychologically, it sucks being in the bottom 50%. There were so many kids who thought they were dumb or underachievers, but were really just in the wrong environment. When they went to college, they blossomed from not being in such a rat race.I'm not saying the solution is to eliminate gifted programs, but let's not pretend that they're universally great for kids. They're often much more status games than actual educational fulfillment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a father with a son with IQ over 160, I can tell you unequivocally that California thinks gifted kids are the enemy.Gifted children, especially profoundly gifted kids like mine are special needs. He can’t function in a regular class because he would become bored and would act out and constantly get in trouble. Since my kid was a toddler we have had to completely rely on ourselves to figure everything out and we were utterly ignored. We have had to go to private school because California does not skip grades even though it’s obvious the child doesn’t belong in the grade level for his age. My kid is 6 grades ahead in math, scored over 175 in his VCI and they refused to even entertain the idea of skipping even a single grade.California is doing whatever it takes to drive away any family that cares even a modicum for their children’s education and had the means or is willing to sacrifice to ensure their children are adequately educated. Meanwhile they are dropping the requirements at the same time, so the gap between private school and public school educated kids keeps growing more and more.It’s pretty telling that in SFUSD, 50% of the black and brown kids graduate high school without being able to read properly. The real racism isn’t gifted kids, it’s dropping the educational standard for those that can’t afford private school so that they graduate and can’t compete when they get into the workforce because they have been undereducated their entire lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42247334</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significant number of recalls associated with the Tesla Cybertruck, stating that it has a recall rate surpassing 91% of all reported vehicles for 2024. It highlights concerns about vehicle safety and reliability, noting that numerous issues have led to these recalls even before the Cybertruck's wider release. The article emphasizes the implications of these recalls for Tesla's reputation and the challenges they may face in the competitive automotive market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article notes that the most recent recall was a physical one, not a software update, and implies that that was unusual.I wonder if you exclude "recalls" resolved by software updates, for all cars, where it would rank then?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Completely unrelated to safety, these vehicles don't look like they are aging well. They are all completely new but the ones I am seeing on the road already look a bit beat up. That finish on them and their general styling emphasize every minor blemish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article has about equal time about what Cybertruck owners dont care about, safety, reliability, etc.&gt; Similar to other critics (earlier this year, a CNN reviewer called the pickup a “disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard, unforgiving steel”)—Drury believes Cybertruck buyers are people “who think ‘I don’t care if I kill people when I drive this thing down the street,’” he says. “There aren’t many of those people out there, so there’s a relatively small market for the Cybertruck.”The Josh Johnson on this one is gonna be good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42242971</guid></item><item><title>25.

It has to be an artistic decision to make it blue, vs brown, so does anyone here know the rationale? Is it to distinguish the different provenance? Is the color shift indicative of the captured spectrum difference? Is it a convention of the sensor? Is it a 2020s fad?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42240686</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These companies are not trying to be companies that sell an LLM to summarize text or write emails. They're trying to make a full Artificial General Intelligence. The LLMs pull in some money today, but are just a step towards what they're actually trying to build. If they can build such a thing (which may or may not be possible, or may not happen soon), then they can immediately use it to make itself better. At this point they don't need nearly as many people working for them, and can begin building products or making money or making scientific discoveries in any field they choose. In which case, they're in essence, the last company to ever exist, and are building the last product we'll ever need (or the first instance of the last product we'll ever produce). And that's why investors think they're worth so much money.some ppl don't believe this cus it seems crazy.anyways, yes they're trying to make their own chips to not be beholden to nvidia, and are investing in other chip startups. And at the same time, nvidia is thinking that if they can make an AI, why should they ever even sell their chips, and so they're working on that too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article says something that seems very false to me once you step outside of the developer sphere:&gt; Most LLM users seem willing to change from Chat-GPT to Claude, for example.Talk to people who aren't engineers and it's all ChatGPT. Many don't even know about the concept of an LLM or a provider, just literally "ChatGPT". The South Park episode where they parody this stuff? They call it ChatGPT. The stuff students use every year to help with homework? ChatGPT. The website that "chat.com" redirects to? ChatGPT. And cai has cornered to market on horny/lonely male teens.The moat here is the broader consciousness that a very very large population of people have adopted. Articles like this take something technical -- the cost of switching over to an LLM, which is cheap -- as an assumption that it will happen, without taking into account just how difficult it is to change social forces.This doesn't mean ChatGPT will forever be what people use. Maybe it will fail spectacularly in a year. But it's OpenAI's game to lose here, not the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was following along nicely until I hit this line:&gt; This is despite the fact that they are identical in both taste and colour.The only way I could ever mistake Coca-Cola for Pepsi is if I were to completely lose my sense of taste. I'm quite surprised to encounter someone who considers them identical or interchangeable.He's right, though, that I could change the supplier for airlines, browsers (or ChatGPT) and my world wouldn't be all that different. It would taste the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42248496</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a report from the U.S. Department of Justice's watchdog that found evidence of civil rights violations by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regarding the search of passengers at U.S. airports. Following the revelations, the DEA has halted these practices, which had previously raised concerns about racial profiling and the infringement of individuals' rights. The research highlights the ongoing need for oversight and reform in law enforcement practices to ensure the protection of civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; f the agents found cash, they seized it through civil forfeiture — a legal process that places the onus on the passenger to prove it was not connected to drugs in order to get it backone of the absolutely most horrible laws that exist in the U.S. today that goes totally against the presumption of innocence that is (supposedly) the bedrock of our legal framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The IG found that the search was based on a tip by an airline employee who passed on the names of passengers who had purchased flights 48 hours before departure. That employee was being paid by the DEA a percentage of the cash seized, the IG found, and had received tens of thousands of dollars over several years. That arrangement is problematic, investigators concluded.How come this is not a fireable offense in any company? This person is leaking a customer's PII to a third party (DEA, in this case). It doesn't really matter if it's to a government official, unless there was a warrant and the airline's Legal council involved.Am I missing anything?  This feels outrageous that airlines are letting this happen. Is there a law that allows employees to break any company's policies under the guise of "suspicion of a crime being committed, even without a warrant"?And it's even worse that the "profits" are being shared with said employee, and this is not seen as bribery and corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; In a management directive issued on Thursday, the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General said it had been hearing complaints about the searches for years — and had recently learned new information that suggested there were significant problems with them, including potential constitutional violations.For years... The recent info is (of course) a passenger recording their encounter.&gt; The IG said investigators could not come to any conclusions about whether the searches involved racial profiling because the DEA does not collect data on all the people it stops — only on the cases in which money is seized.Data on seizures seems like a solid start. Why don't they have data on searches?&gt; “The Department has long been concerned — and long received complaints — about potential racial profiling in connection with cold consent encounters in transportation setting,” the report said, adding that the DEA between 2000 and 2003 “collected consensual encounter data on every encounter in certain mass transportation facilities as part of a Department pilot project to examine the use of race in law enforcement operations.”&gt; But neither the DEA nor the Justice Department “drew any conclusions from the data collected about whether the consensual encounters were being conducted in an unbiased manner, and in 2003 the DEA terminated its data collection efforts,” the report said, and “its consensual encounter activities continued.”Complaints for years, yet decided to stop recording data... That's sketchy as hell.&gt; The IG found that the search was based on a tip by an airline employee who passed on the names of passengers who had purchased flights 48 hours before departure.&gt; That employee was being paid by the DEA a percentage of the cash seized, the IG found, and had received tens of thousands of dollars over several years. That arrangement is problematic, investigators concluded."Fight crime with crime" seems to be a fairly widespread attitude amongst government agencies (reminded of the TSA article yesterday), but this seems particularly egregious.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228795&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42247572</guid></item><item><title>28.

About 55% of patients with pernicious anemia had graying before 50 years as compared to 30% in the control group.[32]/soapboxGet your B12 tested (before taking supplements!).B12 deficiency is known to present in many ways, and also to be often overlooked in clinical settings[1]. It’s known that not everyone presents with the anaemia from it[2], which is often why it’s skipped as a diagnostic option. Additionally, long-term/severe deficiency can present with symptoms almost identical to multiple sclerosis[3]. Deficiency of other B vitamins, such as B2, can cause a functional B12 deficiency as well[4]. It’s also known that supplementation will falsely elevate levels even in the presence of a deficiency./unsoapbox[1] https://www.mcpiqojournal.org/article/S2542-4548(19)30033-5/...[2] https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2022-071725[3] https://researchonline.nd.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article...[4] https://www.iomcworld.org/articles/paradoxical-vitamin-b12-d...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding PABA, I have been taking 500 mg/day for years, and it hasn't done anything at all for restoring my hair color or even for freezing further change. A much higher dose of it can be risky and it's not worth the gamble.I have also been taking B5 as both calcium pantothenate at 500 mg/day and also as pantethine at 300 mg/day for years, neither of which has done anything either in this context.Similarly, B12 hasn't visibly helped either.I suspect that copper is the issue with me.The lowest dose of MitoQ, a 5 mg capsule per day, had lowered my blood pressure significantly after a month of use, well below normal, approaching an unsafe low. Moreover, it took another month after discontinuation of MitoQ for the blood pressure to normalize. I shudder to think how much more powerful SkQ1 would be if taken orally. My first impression is that SkQ1 seems more relevant for local use than for systemic use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; INTRODUCTION

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are uncovering the negative health effects of ultra-processed foods, revealing that these products can disrupt gut health, increase inflammation, and contribute to chronic diseases. The article highlights findings from recent studies that show how additives, high sugar levels, and a lack of nutrients in these foods negatively impact well-being. It emphasizes the need for greater public awareness and policy interventions to encourage healthier eating habits. The growing understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the harms of ultra-processed foods serves as a call to action for individuals and health professionals to prioritize whole, minimally processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/EfaFI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:&gt; Even if the results show conclusively that processing, and not just nutrients, leads to poor health, policymakers will face another difficulty: the definition of upfs remains woolly. The Nova classification has no tolerance at all for artificial ingredients. The mere presence of a chemical additive classifies a food as a upf, regardless of the amount. This can lead to confusing health outcomes—a recent observational study from Harvard University, for example, found that whereas some upfs, such as sweetened drinks and processed meats, were associated with a higher risk of heart disease, others, like breakfast cereals, bread and yogurt, were instead linked to lower risks for cardiovascular disease. Dr Astrup warns that the current classification risks “demonising” a lot of healthy food. Insights from Dr Hall’s work could therefore help refine the understanding of upfs, paving the way for more balanced and useful guidelines.This to me is the most damning evidence against the current classification of 'ultra-processed foods' being absolutely, totally worthless. I look forward to the study noted in the article comparing high-density vs. hyper-palatable. I strongly suspect the study will show its a combinatorial effect... but we'll see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Living in the US, my takeaway is this:Food manufacturers do not care if we stay healthy, but they're also not interested in harming us on purpose. Their goal is to maximize profit, which usually means cheapest ingredients with addictive properties produced as quickly as possible by low-cost labor.But they also know this only works if the market allows it. If nobody bought their snack cakes (random example), they would stop making them. But their snack cakes are designed to make you want to eat the whole package and sold cheaper than an alternative like a healthy fruit and nut mix, making the consumer's choice almost a moot point since consumers tend to trade their own best interests for convenience and "saving" money.And so, they give the market what it buys. Simple as.But I do hate it. I have to put a stupid amount of effort into eating healthy because I don't have room for a garden and healthier alternatives are often more expensive. I can see why most people just reach for the snack cakes and call it done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42246739</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses common misconceptions and self-deceptions developers might have about using Golang (Go) as a programming language. It highlights how these lies often stem from the language's strengths, like simplicity and performance, yet can lead to poor decision-making and inefficiencies in software development. The author encourages readers to critically evaluate their motivations for choosing Go and to consider the potential downsides, ultimately advocating for a more informed and realistic approach to selecting programming tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article makes a lot of great points about the shortcomings of Go. I don’t think explicit error handling is one of them however. I’ve previously spoken about my loathing of exception handling because it adds a “magic” layer to things which is way too easy to mess up. From a technical standpoint that isn’t necessarily a good argument, but from a pragmatic standpoint and decades of experience… well I will take explicit error handling which happens exactly where the errors occur every day. You can argue that Rust does it in a more elegant way, and I prefer it for personal projects. For big projects with a lot of developers of various skill level joining and leaving I think Go’s philosophy is one of the sanest approaches to error handling in the modern world.Staying in that lane. In my part of the world Go is seeing adoption that no other “new” language has exactly because of its simplicity. It’s not the best language, but it’s often the best general purpose language because it has a lot of build in opinions which protect you from yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust and Go are very different and I feel people want a middle ground that just doesn't exist currently.A garbage collected relatively simple language that compiles into a statically linked binary but has a type system similar to rust, rest types etc.Syntactically, Gleam and Kotlin come somewhat close but not really. I like Rust but I do believe it is too complicated for many people who are capable of creating something but are not CS grads nor working as programmers. If you're only gonna use the language every once in a while you won't remember what a vtable is, how and when things are dropped etc. I understand that "the perfect language" doesn't exist but I think both Go and Rust brought amazing things to the table. I can only hope someone takes inspiration from both and creates a widely usable, simple programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Go: "I'm a simple language!"
  User uses Go for some time.
  User: "I hate you, you're a simple language!"

Perhaps it's because I'm 50+, I love a simple language.I feel the "critique" is not very balanced, and I view judgements that are not balanced as weak, as everything in technology is about tradeoffs.I of course come to a different conclusion:

In so doing, he anticipated the evolution of structuralism, post-structuralism, and critical theory.It seems to have been just one historian who found and validated the story.  The author sister was the subject of fawning but incomplete treatment (her story was sympathetic, not damning); the historian found the author's work and traced the author's sailor gigs to validate the connections.There can be an element of passivation to history: "don't worry, we're understanding more and getting better".  Thanks to both the author and the historian, it appears much was understood even then, and we shouldn't rest on tides that might not be rising.Critical theory has fatal flaws and anger almost never leads to insight or the right incentives, but how else would normalized and profitable injustice be stripped of a legal veil?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool story, but I wish this were published into the public domain online.It's kind of weird that a 150-year-old slave narrative is being sold by a University press.At any rate, here's the original text from the Australian paper: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/rendition/nla.news-articl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42246416</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, particularly focusing on new methodologies that enhance how robots learn from their environments. It highlights the shift from traditional programming to more adaptive learning systems, which allow robots to improve their performance through experience and interaction. The piece explores the implications of these developments for various industries and the potential to create more sophisticated, autonomous machines that can work alongside humans, revolutionizing fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did a review of state of the art in robotics recently in prep for some job interviews and the stack is the same as all other ML problems these days, take a large pretrained multi modal model and do supervised fine tuning of it on your domain data.In this case it's "VLA" as in Vision Language Action models, where a multimodal decoder predicts action tokens and "behavior cloning" is a fancy made up term for supervised learning, because all of the RL people can't get themselves to admit that supervised learning works way better than reinforcement learning in the real world.Proper imitation learning where a robot learns from 3rd person view of humans doing stuff does not work yet, but some people in the field like to pretend that teleoperation and "behavior cloning" is a form of imitation learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone find is suspcious that all these paywalled fluff tech legacy media articles keep on ending up on hn? Feels like an op. Who in tech actually reads NYT for example?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, I wonder if we can use LLMs to learn learning patterns, I guess the bottleneck would be the curse of dimensionality when it comes to real world problems, but I think maybe (correct me if I'm wrong) geographic/domain specific attention networks could be used.Maybe it's like:1. Intention, context
2. Attention scanning for components
3. Attention network discovery
4. Rescan for missing components
5. If no relevant context exists or found

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of the Wallace Line, a boundary that separates the flora and fauna of Asia and New Guinea, and its impact on biodiversity. It highlights recent research exploring how ocean currents and climate influences, particularly through changes in wave patterns, can affect the species distribution across this line. The research suggests that these environmental factors play a crucial role in the movement of marine life, thereby contributing to our understanding of biogeography and the evolutionary processes that shape ecosystems in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses NVIDIA's new generative AI model, Fugatto, which is designed to create high-quality, realistic sound effects and music for content creators, filmmakers, and game developers. Fugatto leverages advanced deep learning techniques to generate sounds based on various inputs, allowing for unprecedented creativity and efficiency in audio production. The model can generate a wide range of sounds, making it a versatile tool for enhancing multimedia projects. The post highlights the implications of this technology for the entertainment industry and the potential improvements it offers in sound design workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this might be a technical breakthrough, none of the examples sounded any good. Every aspect of the provided sounds are bad. The music sounds muffled and badly mixed. The generated beat isn't a beat that grooves, or has anything interesting in it. The barking saxophone sounded just bad. The voices sounded somewhat convincing.In general I think that with ai generated audio it is much more noticeable how utterly bad everything is, that ai generates. I already absolutely hate the two AI voices that are in a lot of YouTube videos and are a reason for me to close the Video immediately most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would love to see a model focusing on making virtual instruments.There are sample-based virtual instruments, but they do miss some subtleties, and there are physics-based ones where some subtleties are preserved, but generally worse sounding because actually modelling real hardware evolved over centuries is really difficult.Even hardware-based instruments like electric guitars/violins/cellos etc. generally sound distinct from and less interesting than their acoustic counterparts. Electric guitar players seem to use various amplifier tricks to make up for that, and that's now a big separate instrument. But I think the point stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The description is amazing, but the demo video feels underwhelming.Available music generation models sound much more musical and have much better diction on vocals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42242932</guid></item><item><title>37.

&lt;p&gt;The article on functional affirmations discusses the power of affirmations and how they can be utilized to foster a positive mindset and promote personal growth. It emphasizes the significance of crafting affirmations that are realistic, specific, and rooted in one's values, as well as the importance of consistency in practicing them. The piece also provides practical tips on how to create effective affirmations, including focusing on the present tense, incorporating emotional resonance, and maintaining a daily routine to reinforce these positive statements. Overall, the content encourages readers to leverage affirmations as a tool for empowerment and self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not work in a functional language, but these ideas have helped me a lot anyway. The only idea here that I find less directly applicable outside purely functional languages is the "Errors as values [instead of exceptions]" one.On the surface, it makes complete sense, the non-locality of exceptions make them hard to reason about for the same reasons that GOTO is hard to reason about, and representing failure modes by values completely eliminates this non-locality. And in purely functional languages, that's the end of the story. But in imperative languages, we can do something like this:  def my_effectful_function():
    if the_thing_is_bad:
      # do the failure thing
      raise Exception
      # or
      return Failure()
    return Success()

and a client of this function might do something like this:  def client_function():
    ...
    my_effectful_function()
    ...

and completely ignore the failure case. Now, ignoring the failure is possible with both the exception and the failure value, but in the case of the failure value, it's much more likely to go unnoticed. The exception version is much more in line with the "let it crash" philosophy of Erlang and Elixir, and I'm not sure if the benefits of locality outweigh those of the "let it crash" philosophy.Have any imperative folks here successfully used the "errors as values" idea?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These are great ideas and patterns even if you’re not doing functional programming.FP-first/only languages tend to push you in these directions because it makes programming with them easier.In languages where FP is optional, it takes discipline and sometimes charisma to follow these affirmations/patterns/principles.. but they’re worth it IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In many (but not all) scenarios "Make illegal states unrepresentable" is way too expensive to implement.Especially when dealing with a fast changing domain, having to support different versions of data shapes across long time periods: dynamic data definitions are more economic and will still provide sufficient runtime protection."Errors as values" - what is an error? I see this pattern misused often, because not enough thought was put into the definition of an error."Disk is Full" vs. "data input violates some business rule" are two very - very - different things and should be treated differently. Exceptions are the right abstraction in the first case. It's not in the second case."Functional core, imperative shell" - 100% agreement here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244851</guid></item><item><title>38. 1B nested loop iterations</title><link>https://benjdd.com/languages/</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have to be extremely careful with benchmarks like these. It's very easy to measure and conclude different things. In this case, it really only measures the compiler's ability to optimise the `for` loop construct - nothing else. It doesn't say anything much about the languages' general "speed", whatever that means (which is generally the implication with tests like this).Some points to consider:- `for` is not how you'd write an optimised loop in all languages.- Be VERY suspicious of microbenchmarks on C, C++, and similar - the compilers are smarter than you think and you won't get the code you wrote.- Languages do arrays differently - added memory effects on performance.- Languages do numbers differently.- Summing and modulo is somewhat contrived example. Modulo is one of the slower instructions out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specifically, there are two loops, one nested inside the other, and the total number of iterations is 1 billion.I was hoping this would test how long it takes to compile 1 billion nested loops.  As in, a 2-billion-line source file where the first billion lines each open a loop and the next billion lines close them all.  That would be… interesting.  Pointless, but interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another fave of mine by this person: https://benjdd.com/az/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42248315</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally believe the reason for non-western fiction gaining so much mainstream traction is quite simple: it provides a perspective almost entirely seperated from the reality most people face.
Even simple scenarios, like running a small store or living life in a rural village, are so different from our usual experiences that it provides a way for our brains to release some of the pressure that comes from our busy day-to-day lives.
The "isekai" genre (being transported to a different world, usually after dying an unfortune death) is an extreme take on this, where almost all connection to reality is removed entirely.Compare those stories to most (not all) modern mainstream western fiction, and you'll find that a lot of it tends to take place within our existing world instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been on a Japanese literature kick for a while now.For me the characters are the main difference from American literature. The article mentions this briefly, but I find that in the novels I've read (admittedly translated), Japanese novel characters have much more depth. They're flawed people often with selfish motivations, and it's much more reflective of real life.Plot structure is very different as well with most of these novels not having a true setting &gt; rising action &gt; climax &gt; falling action style plot like American literature tends to have. The books often just end without much resolution at all.Probably the biggest reason I've been reading them though is that I'm just tired of "young adult" books that have so much popularity here in America. It's like a tag you can throw on to shield your bad writing. It feels like everything popular here is written with 6th grade grammar.  Maybe this phenomenon exists in Japan too, but we have the filter that translation provides. Presumably most translated novels are at least somewhat successful and well written, or else they wouldn't have been translated.For reference, of the translated fiction I've read, I'd recommend -Lady Joker by TakamuraDevotion of Suspect X by HigashinoOut by KirinoBreasts and Eggs, Ms Ice Sandwich, and Heaven by KawakamiConvenience Store Woman and Earthlings by MurataThe Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and Kafka By The Shore by MurakamiSnow Country by KawabataStrange Weather in Tokyo by KawakamiNo Longer Human by NazaiI am a Cat by NetsukeThe Memory Police by Ogawa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a startling book with a rather disturbing wartime scene that has haunted me for years.Currently I'd recommend Yakumo Koizumi and Natsume Soseki for more old school Japanese writings.Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea is another great read, despite the author being an extremely disagreeable person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219989</guid></item><item><title>41.

It's ultimately function over form in this case; who cares if you don't like how it looks? I can only dream that the visibility and safety of having features like such a low hood and large bumpers would be incorporated into other vehicles (i.e., every SUV ever).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The job of delivery services today is delivering small packages, not information. So everybody (USPS, UPS, Amazon) is converging on the same feature set:- Van big enough to stand up in- Door between driver compartment and package storage- Bin/shelf type package storage, not bags or piles- Good visibility- Battery electric- Optimized for 0 to 30 MPH with lots of stops. Aerodynamics don't matter much. Regenerative braking does.Amazon has some cute features. The driver wears some small RFID device, and when they step out of the truck, the door to package storage closes and locks, and the truck won't move. Amazon's new vans also have very high visibility from the rear, with many LEDs, so it's hard to rear-end them by accident. Good because they double-part frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249545</guid></item><item><title>43.

I'm assuming the later with content like&gt;Substantial and ongoing improvements in AI’s capabilities, along with its broad applicability to a large fraction of the cognitive tasks in the economy and its ability to spur complementary innovations, offer the promise of significant improvements to productivity and implications for workforce dynamics.I keep waiting for the industry shifting changes to materialise, or at least begin to materialise. I see promise with the coding tools, and personally find Claude and Cursor like tools to warrant some of the general hype, but when I look around for similar changes in other tangentially related roles I draw a blank. Some of the Microsoft meeting minute summaries are good, while the transcripts are abysmal. These are helpful, but not necessarily game changing.Hallucinations, or even the risk of hallucinations, seem like a fundamental show stopper for some domains where this could otherwise be useful. Is this likely to be overcome in the near future? I'd assume it's a core area of research, but I know nothing of this area, so any insights would be enlightening.What other domains are currently being uplifted in the same way as coding?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a layman (as with most people here), I think this is a good article that summarises the current research on AI's impact on labour markets. The website itself seems like a reliable source.These points made sense to me: it is impossible to predict what will actually happen, we need better pro-level tools for AI assistance (e.g. Copilot, writer autocomplete, ControlNet) rather than AI as a full replacement, and we need better and clearer paths to retraining and job mobility.I disagreed with only one point in there: that research is needed for ways to compensate people for the use of their creative works, but that is solely because of my pro-free-cultural moral views. The rest of the article is still good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty certain that one of the first things we'll see is more jobs recording worker activity (computer activity, calls, video recording) as training data for future automation. Data from teleoperation of robots would be especially useful for physical tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249090</guid></item><item><title>44.

Go Production Performance Gotcha – GOMAXPROCS</title><link>https://metoro.io/blog/go-production-performance-gotcha-gomaxprocs</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of the Go programming language's runtime settings, particularly the `GOMAXPROCS` variable, on application performance in production environments. It explains that `GOMAXPROCS` determines the number of operating system threads that can execute Go code simultaneously, which plays a crucial role in optimizing CPU usage. The text emphasizes the importance of configuring `GOMAXPROCS` appropriately based on deployed environments to ensure efficient resource utilization and improve performance. It also includes practical advice and considerations for developers to enhance their Go applications' performance by leveraging this setting effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another potential avenue for problems like this, which I'm a fan of, is taking advantage of k8s's static CPU policy:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-mana...Using this (plus guaranteed QoS), you end up with containers which can only even "see" a subset of cores of the whole node (and they get those cores all to themselves), which is great for reducing noisy neighbors when big machines are running many different services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't a gotcha, it's an important aspect of how Go runs. While it's not highlighted enough concurrency isn't magic, and GOMAXPROCS is important to control your Go app, especially within production environments.Although it's not well known benchmarks for programming languages would show even faster results for Go with GOMAXPROCS set to 1.This lets single-threaded benchmarks run with less overhead.A real missed opportunity in communication. Because this isn't the first time we see articles like these pop up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In busy systems, GOMAXPROCS=cpu.limits will still lead to the process exceeding its cfs quota and be throttled as the Go runtime has additional threads beyond just GOMAXPROCS. IME, the only way to (nearly) guarantee there's no throttling is to set cpu.limits=GOMAXPROCS+1 to leave some room for these system threads. Unfortunately, there's broad adoption of uber/automaxprocs (which makes the same error) and utilizing the downward API to do this for other cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245037</guid></item><item><title>46.

Even with billions of investments from the big car companies, investors and many millions in subsidies, they simply couldn’t make it work at all. Instead of buying the California startup just to shut it down, should’ve invested most of their money there instead. They are leaving an enormous eyesore in the northern Sweden landscape with thoudands of people unemployed, many of which may be deported now, with very little to show for it other than many scandals (including paying millions of dollars in bonus to their incompetent executives even as they file for bankruptcy)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like Northvolt never really had a product. Can someone please explain why people invest billions in companies that have not sorted out how to build what they want to sell?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is also this Czech failed battery startup "HE3DA". It went from revolutionary to evolutionary to "well, there is at least one parameter (robustness) that's better than  lithium batteries" to "hmm the measurements don't quite match the specs". There were individual investors, big show for opening a factory (with capacity of 1.4GWH we were told; actual batteries sold in 2024: single digit MWhs). Now they fired almost everyone and can't pay their billshttps://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/pravda-o-bate...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42242936</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a potential Supreme Court case that could influence whether Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to terminate the accounts of users accused of piracy. The case stems from a dispute between a copyright holder and ISPs, highlighting legal considerations over digital rights, due process, and the responsibilities of ISPs in monitoring and managing user activities. The outcome may set important precedents regarding the balance between copyright enforcement and individual users’ rights in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the arguments I've read against this, I think not enough emphasis is being placed on the strongest one:In the modern world online access is as necessary as water, power and phone service. No one would suggest forcing the power company to cut service to a customer over trivial civil law matters (which is what copyright is) that are completely unrelated to the company or the service it provides. No one should suggest cutting internet access either.I guess ISPs in the US don't want to use that argument due to the regulatory implications (the common carrier classification thing)? But someone should be making that argument to the court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should the phone company be liable for their customers performing a copywrited song on the phone? Why should an ISP be required to surveil their customers but not the phone company? When my dish washing machine can take voice commands does it get deputized by the copywrite police too?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't the place which the ISPs were receiving notices from, one of the ones that was actually just Copyright Trolling?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_trolli.e. they were more about generating bogus notices based upon no real evidence, and didn't even try ensuring they had court worthy evidence before sending noticesIf that's the case, then how is that ignored when other, similar firms had their operators sanctioned and thrown in jail for doing the same thing?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenda_Law&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243715</guid></item><item><title>49.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I installed this in the morning to give it a test drive, and after several hours, I learned the following: it's great when I reach for the phone as a distraction; it's a big annoyance otherwise.E.g. each time I want to change the currently playing song, what was muscle memory gets scrambled by the interruption. Or, when I'm taking a lot of photos (like on my daughter's kindergarten event today), I tend to keep the screen off in between, and rely on being able to turn it on and shoot a photo in less than two seconds, total. Guess how that got screwed up by this app.The app itself is great, and I'm still a believer in the concept of managing executive function issues by throwing obstacles in front of bad habits and known focus black holes. However, this experience made me discover the third class of phone activity, next to "distraction" and "work" - quick, intermittent, on-the-fly use, the kind you ideally don't think much about. This class does not distract you... unless someone adds friction to it.I just saw the app has "every N unlocks" option, I'll try it out and see if this helps with the "third class".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last year I laser-cut a replica of my phone out of wood. I looked at it, said the words "this is my phone", and put it in my pocket, where I normally carried my phone. You wouldn't believe how many times I mindlessly pulled out this piece of wood from my pocket, intending to check messages, or whatever. When I placed it on the table while having dinner with a friend, my inner eye was looking at it, thinking maybe there is a new message. It was absolutely absurd and scary. You can try this out yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great! Apps like these are sorely needed. My feedback would be, apart from what others are saying about sub vs one-time purchase, to look at what Leechblock firefox extension is doing.The key point is to make it harder (but not impossible) for me to use the phone. A "Do you need this?" is a great start, but since I can easily sneak by, I will soon do that. Even if I click "1 minute" to get a reminder, that should not be a simple notification, but back to the large big screen covering things.What LB does is genius. You can enable a barrier so that if you reeeeeeally need to, you can get around, but it's annoying and time consuming, and thus the quick loop of "pick up phone and get stuck" is broken. The barrier in LB can be to type  a (long) passphrase, or my favorite: a 64-char random string which cannot be copy-pasted. You need to manually look at 2-3 chars at a time and replicate the whole thing. Very effective.But again, also the snap back to reality thing. If I keep using it, throw up a big overlay with a good question "Is your attention well spent?" for example. Make me wait before I can continue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254156</guid></item><item><title>2.

But it gets even stupider.I found one a few years back when I repaired a linear power supply. This required me to reverse engineer it first because there was no service manual. I buzzed the whole thing out and found out that one of the electrolytic capacitors had both legs connected to ground. They must have shipped thousands of power supplies with that error in it and no one even noticed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commodore had 3 capacitors mounted backwards on the A3640, the CPU board of the Amiga 4000 with 68040 processors: https://youtu.be/zhUpcBpJUzg?si=j6UFmIJzoC-UDS6u&amp;t=945Also mentioned here: https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/a3640&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253119</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought the whole point of these camera LEDs was to have them wired to/through the power to the camera, so they are always on when the camera is getting power, no matter what.Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see why some people might be concerned about the camera, but I'm far more concerned by the microphone. There's far more sensitive and actionable information that can be gathered from me that way! I'm glad that macOS started putting a light in the menubar when the microphone is in use, but I'd prefer to have unhackable hardware for that instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8, it's easily possible record video with the webcam LED off. I did not verify newer generations of the X1 Carbon.Lenovo put a little physical switch—they call it "ThinkShutter"—that serves to physically obstruct the webcam lens to prevent recording. It's supposed to have only two positions: lens obstructed or not. But if the user accidentally slides it halfway, you can still record video with the lens unobstructed but somehow the webcam LED turns off. It's because the ThinkShutter actually moves 2 pieces of plastic: 1 to cover the lens, 1 to cover the LED. But the piece covering the LED blocks it first, before the other piece of plastic blocks the lens. I discovered this accidentally yesterday while toying with a X1 Carbon... I am reporting it to Lenovo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259278</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just tried the demo on my very capable laptop (ASUS Zephyrus G15 2021, Linux, Sway; Firefox, also tried Chromium).Performance is execrable. Text rendering is awful. Input is simply broken (e.g. my Compose key just doesn’t work). Double clicking highlighted the entire canvas thing, as well as the word under the cursor. Right clicking did nothing. Scrolling isn’t captured. The first menu thing I happened to try in the full-UI https://zetaoffice.net/demos/simple-examples/rainbow_writer.... example (Format → Theme, maybe I just picked unfortunately) crashed the whole app (which means that it just stops working mysteriously, leaving the UI in the last state it was in).And you can’t even get started until it’s downloaded 50MB. (Though I’m actually mildly impressed it’s only that size.)Seriously, this is completely unusable. It’s “cool tech demo”, but I would hate to actually have to use it.And I’m pretty sure, based on my rather accurate understanding of how all these things work (comprehensive on the web side, good on the native side, not so much specific about LibreOffice itself), that a lot of this is going to be completely unfixable—though a couple of the things I identified are fairly straightforward to fix, which is if anything a further indictment.It’s going to be extremely hard to get even decent results without targeting real DOM instead of going pure-canvas, and you can’t get excellent results without doing so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ZetaOffice is also available as a native Desktop application for Linux and Windows. Download the Beta here.Why is a desktop application being developed and provided if this is compatible with LibreOffice (since the latter already has desktop applications)? Is it just to have the same name and recognition?Is the desktop application kept on par with the latest LibreOffice release or does it only guarantee document format compatibility up to a specific version?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's excellent! You guys should interact with Nextcloud or someone should try their hand at a Nextcloud App [1]. Nextcloud's solution to Google Docs &amp; friends is via the integration of OnlyOffice[2], which requires a DocumentServer [3] to function in the context of Nextcloud. Even without the collaboration aspect, having LibreOffice work off WASM, without any extra infrastructure requirement would be an excellent edition to that ecosystem I think.[1] https://apps.nextcloud.com/[2] https://www.onlyoffice.com/[3] https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249746</guid></item><item><title>6.

Guile's original pitch is that it's intended to be easily used side-by-side with C. However, because it's an older language, it hasn't (to my knowledge) picked up newer sensibilities like having a package manager shipped with the language toolchain.One thing I like about Guile is how much effort they've put into describing compatibility with the RNRS standards. Not sure how Schemey Janet actually is, but I'm curious to find out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "the turtles are metaphors":( The turtles were real, not metaphorical: http://classicacorn.computinghistory.org.uk/8bit_focus/logo/...(it fits the definition of metaphor 'One thing conceived as representing another; a symbol' but it has the feel of people saying "my niece thought the floppy disk save icon is a refrigerator because that's where you save leftover food" not realising that it was a real piece of fun/cute hardware many moons ago).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253241</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;Git-crypt is a tool that enables transparent encryption of files within a Git repository, allowing users to secure sensitive information while maintaining the collaborative advantages of using Git. The project leverages Git's built-in capabilities, permitting selective encryption of files based on patterns or explicit inclusion. This ensures that only authorized users, who possess the required keys, can access the encrypted content, facilitating secure workflows in environments where confidentiality is paramount. The site provides details on installation, usage, and key management, making it accessible for developers looking to implement encryption in their version control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Git-crypt is a dead product with numerous unresolved issues and drawbacks.Newer versions of git cause git to crash when invoking git-crypt[0].It doesn’t scale with users: Off-boarding a key is a commit in git. Since it is trivially easy to rewind a git repo before the revocation commit and then decrypt with the revoked key, this means you need to rotate every key under management when any revoke is performed.It provides the illusion of asymmetric key encryption, but your asymmetric key wraps a shared symmetric key used to encrypt the entire repository. This also means a user could roll the repository back before a key was revoked and steal the symmetric key used to protect the repository and then use that key to decrypt the repository any time in the future.It doesn’t scale with the number of files under management. As a result of how it’s implemented, every invocation is a separate process launch. This means every file triggers an asymmetric unwrap of the symmetric key. If you’re protecting your GPG key with hardware keyfob, decrypting the repository will take a long time.This product seemed like a cool idea for a while but it’s implementation leave much to be desired and has not stood the test of time…Password-store[1] does a better job than git-crypt for single user git based gpg encrypted password management.For multi-user git repo encryption I prefer Mozilla SOPS[2], especially when coupled with something like AWS KMS…But then you might consider stepping up to something like Hashicorp Vault[3] or Infisical[4].[0] https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/issues/273[1] https://www.passwordstore.org/[2] https://github.com/getsops/sops[3] https://www.vaultproject.io/[4] https://infisical.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in E2EE git repos, you might be interested in a project I've been maintaining for a few years now: git-remote-restic. It stores the git repository in a restic repository hosted on any untrusted storage. It is designed for secure archival, but it does support multi-user access (no web UI because, of course, it's E2EE).https://github.com/CGamesPlay/git-remote-restic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a maintained alternative to storing encrypted secrets in git, but don’t store the (wrapped) encryption key there, thereby avoiding the biggest downfalls seen here. And a first-class api and tooling in multiple languages to obtain said secrets.Here’s the GitHub link for the rust version of SecureStore: https://github.com/neosmart/securestore-rs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244093</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not clear why HTML rendering needed to be infected with async. None of the example code has a clear need for async - even the `is_admin()` method would be a prefetched property in any reasonable database model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a bunch of these kinds of html renderers. Here's mine:
https://pypi.org/project/simple-html/But there are many others. Not sure I understand the point of async rendering, unless you want to mix IO with rendering? Which feels a bit too close to old PHP+html for my blood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't clearly see a use case. I went on to the "why" section but I'm having a hard time trying to understand what this is trying to solve. Perhaps a clear and simple example to see why you would use it could be useful. Also I find it extremely verbose to write HTML the way is shown in the examples at the top. Having used Jinja for a very long time, its simplicity and separation from logic makes it almost (for me) the only templating lang that you need to learn in Python. Writing HTML code the way is shown is clearly not for me, but there might be uses cases for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42251919</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A couple years ago I made a codepen to generate arbitrarily long Genji-mon from a ruleset, and managed to write a rule that reduces the number of required special cases to one. However, these rules are very fragile, and "break" with lengths &gt; 5 (edit: or maybe they don't! this deserves further exploration). Glad to see someone else discovering the structure behind this interesting system!https://codepen.io/rezmason/pen/ejWogV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great article! Funny about Yugiri (39), because your version is a mirror image to Eawase (17), and the traditional Japanese Yugiri breaks that symmetry.Every Genji-mon that is not self-symmetrical should have a mirror image, which I was able to quickly verify in the Genji-mon table you displayed.Minori (40) is the only non symmetrical Genji-mon that breaks the rule, because it's the only one whose mirror image is also isomorphic to itself.I can only imagine that there was something deliberate about the symmetry breaking for Yugiri, given the almost fanatical attention to detail in Japanese arts in general, and the equally strong penchant for deliberate imperfection in traditions like Kintsugi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loved this. Great writing and a bit of cultural arcana I knew nothing about but which resonates into the present day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256394</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the development of cuneiform, the world’s first writing system, created by the ancient Sumerians around 3200 BCE. It details how this revolutionary form of writing emerged from the need for record-keeping in trade and administration. Initially, Sumerians used picture symbols to represent goods and ideas, which later evolved into a complex system of wedge-shaped marks inscribed on clay tablets. This innovation not only facilitated communication and the management of city-states but also laid the foundation for future writing systems, profoundly impacting human civilization by allowing for the recording of history, literature, and legal codes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;James Scott, in his book Against the Grain, offers an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the factors that led to the appearance of projects such as writing and irrigation channels in Mesopotamia as intensive agriculture gradually became the only possible means of sustenance. There was a lot more going on than a simple/linear intensification, and it was less cut and dry than the brief summary given of that development in this article would suggest.Jennifer Pournelle's 2003 paper[1] presenting new evidence for the area's landscape in antiquity is also quite eye opening, as the presence of the coast further inland than was previously believed upended a lot of long-established notions about the development of civilization there.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258858442_The_Litto...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've always wondered whether the Sumerians knew they were the first. Past empires, lost civilizations, and ancient artifacts have always fascinated us. The first museum emerges is Mesopotamia around 530 BC; the Egyptian obelisk installed next to the brand-new Colosseum in Rome was older then than the Colosseum is now; legends of giants and heroes of bygone ages are literary universals. We hunger for the past.But the Sumerians were first. There was no glorious but crumbled past empire to inspire them. They figured out everything for the first time, and we know little about what they thought about it.Now consider that humanity is likely the first in the Milky Way galaxy. We too have to figure things out for the first time, but on a grander scale. What will history think of us?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Chinese assert that they in fact started the first civilization, before the civilizations of the Tigris/Euphrates, Nile, or Indus. I never had the time to really dig into it to evaluate the arguments, but I don't think it's correct because the Shang Dynasty is usually placed around 1600 BC while Sumer is dated around 3000 BC (or even earlier). So I don't know how the Chinese claim they were first. But I can tell you from living there, that it is very widely and very firmly believed as fact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42255829</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a novel approach for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using a framework called "DECODE," which stands for "Distributed and Cooperative Observation-based Decentralized learning." DECODE aims to enhance cooperation and communication among agents in complex environments while addressing challenges related to non-stationarity in MARL. The authors present theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DECODE framework in improving the performance of agents in collaborative tasks compared to traditional MARL methods. Overall, the work contributes to advancing the understanding and implementation of cooperative strategies in decentralized learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project "jazelle-wii" is a GitHub repository that provides an implementation of the Jazelle technology for the Nintendo Wii console. It focuses on enabling the execution of Java bytecode on the Wii hardware by utilizing a custom interpreter. The repository includes the source code, build instructions, and documentation to assist developers in using and contributing to the project. The primary goal is to facilitate Java development for the Wii platform, enhancing its capabilities and providing a new environment for developers familiar with Java.&lt;/p&gt;

I did something similar on the old Raspberry Pi Zeros which had the right chip for it. It was a Linux kernel module with with a bit implemented in ARM assembly. All it executed was an add, I always meant to go back and reverse more functionality of the instruction set.    .byte 0x05 @ iconst_2
    .byte 0x06 @ iconst_3
    .byte 0x60 @ iadd
    .byte 0xAC @ ireturn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the mid 2000s I tried to reverse engineer some of it. Got to executing a few instructions. Found that ARMv5TEJ cores did not natively execute very many Java instructions. It was sad. I had say hoped that later cores got better.I never understood why ARM hid jazzelle docs away. It made no sense. It is probably why Jazzelle died.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42251508</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;D-Link has announced that it will not release security patches for approximately 60,000 older modem models, stating that the effort and resources required to update them do not justify the potential security risks. This decision has raised concerns over user safety, as these devices could remain vulnerable to cyber threats. D-Link recommends that users upgrade to newer models to ensure improved security and functionality, highlighting the importance of maintaining up-to-date technology in the face of evolving security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

I've had nothing but good experiences with Ubiquiti (Unifi) and OpenWRT. At the lower end of the price spectrum, OpenWRT supported devices can be an incredible value, and most will probably remain supported for decades to come.More broadly, it's not just about the support commitment but also about the company's reputation for shipping solid software. i.e. what is the prior on a scenario like this after the product goes EOL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something the EU Product Liability Directive potentially addresses. It demands that vendors (or importers) of products need to update their product if that's required to keep them secure. Otherwise they are liable for damages, even psychological damages.There is no specific duration mentioned in the directive, so it's probably best from a vendor point of view to add product lifetime info to the product description or the contract, up front.In Germany there is something similar in place, already and the expectation is that products (and necessary apps to run the products) need to be updated for 5 years on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249790</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's decision to transition from using Kubernetes to Google Cloud Run for application deployment and management. The author highlights the complexities and challenges of managing Kubernetes, such as the steep learning curve, the overhead of maintaining infrastructure, and the need for constant updates and management. In contrast, Google Cloud Run provides a simpler, serverless solution that allows for easier scaling, reduced operational burden, and a more intuitive approach to deploying applications. The author shares personal experiences and insights that led to this shift, emphasizing the benefits of Cloud Run's streamlined processes for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate “cloud shit”, and a small part of me is convinced that literally no one actually likes it, and everyone is playing a joke on me.I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Kubernetes comes with substantial infrastructure costs that go beyond DevOps and management time. The high cost arises from needing to provision a bare-bones cluster with redundant management nodes.That's your problem right there. You really don't want to be setting up and managing a cluster from scratch for anything less than a datacenter-scale operation. If you are already on a cloud provider just use their managed Kubernetes offering instead. It will come with a free control plane and abstract away most of the painful parts for you (like etcd, networking, load balancing, ACLs, node provisioning, kubelets, proxies). That way you just bring your own nodes/VMs and can still enjoy the deployment standardization and other powerful features without the operational burden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People talk about Kubernetes as container orchestration, but I think that's kind of backwards.Kubernetes is a tool for creating computer clusters. Hence the name "Borg" (Kubernetes's grandpa) referring to assimilating heterogeneous hardware into a collective entity. Containers are an implementation detail.Do you need a computer cluster? If so k8s is pretty great. If you don't care about redundancy and can get all the compute you need out of a single machine, then you may not need a cluster.Once you're using containers on a bunch of VMs in different geographical regions, then you effectively have hacked together a virtual cluster. You can get by without k8s. You just have to write a lot of glue code to manage VMs, networking, load balancing, etc on the cloud provider you use. The overhead of that is probably larger than just learning Kubernetes in the long run, but it's reasonable to take on that technical debt if you're just trying to move fast and aren't concerned about the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42252336</guid></item><item><title>16.

In it he describes an anaphor for augmented reality rooted in pagan animism. Unlike monotheistic Western approaches of interfacing artificial intelligence like ChatGPT or Siri, he advocates to leverage the possibility of augmented reality technologies to extend places and objects to populate the world with many different agents or "gods".Author should read Daemon by Daniel Suarez written in 2006 that explores the idea of persistent and potentially powerful AR entities that interact with humans. It also loosely plays with the idea of AR somatic gestures acting as a mystical conduit for "primitive incantations" that have a physical affect on the real world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42258540</guid></item><item><title>17.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The thing that the author says they would prefer is already in Python, it's called NewType (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NewType)They say "...so I can't create a bunch of different names for eg typing.Any and then expect type checkers to complain if I mix them."`MyType = NewType('MyType', Any)`is how you do this.At the end, they suggest a workflow: "I think my ideal type hint situation would be if I could create distinct but otherwise unconstrained types for things like function arguments and function returns, have mypy or other typing tools complain when I mixed them, and then later go back to fill in the concrete implementation details of each type hint"That's just doing the above, but then changing the `NewType('MyType', Any)` to something like `NewType('MyType', list[dict[str, int]])` later when you want to fill in the concrete implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; After the code has stabilized I can probably go back to write type hints [...] but I'm not sure that this would provide very much value.I think most developers who revisit their projects 6+ months later would disagree with the second part of this statement.My typical flow for "quick scripts" is:on first pass I'll add basic type hints (typing ":str" after a func param takes .2 seconds)for more complex data structures (think a json response from an api), dict (or typing.Dict) work fineif you want a Python project to be maintainable, type hints are a requirement imho.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree that writing type hints can be painful, especially if you are starting with a large code base that is mostly untyped. You might consider using RightTyper (https://github.com/RightTyper/RightTyper) - basically run your Python 3.12+ program with it, and it will add type hints to your code. It’s fast, basically automatic, and by design RightTyper avoids overfitting to your types, letting a type checker like MyPy surface edge cases. In effect, the type checker becomes an anomaly detector (Full disclosure, I am one of the authors of RightTyper.)From the GitHub page:RightTyper is a Python tool that generates types for your function arguments and return values. RightTyper lets your code run at nearly full speed with almost no memory overhead. As a result, you won't experience slow downs in your code or large memory consumption while using it, allowing you to integrate it with your standard tests and development process. By virtue of its design, and in a significant departure from previous approaches, RightTyper only captures the most commonly used types, letting a type checker like mypy detect possibly incorrect type mismatches in your code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253756</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author's experience of moving away from Kubernetes for their DevOps processes, leading to significant improvements in team happiness and productivity. The author highlights the complexity and challenges associated with Kubernetes, including steep learning curves and operational overhead. By opting for simpler, more traditional deployment methods, the team was able to reduce stress, streamline workflows, and enhance collaboration. The author encourages others to evaluate their infrastructure choices and consider whether the benefits of Kubernetes truly outweigh its complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

They appear totally incompetent in both management and basic half-brain analytical skills. Who in the heck creates a cluster per service per cloud provider, duplicate all the supporting services around it, burn money and sanity in a pit, and blame the tool.Literally every single decision they listed was to use any of the given tools in the absolute worst, incompetent way possible. I wouldn't trust them with a Lego toy set with this record.The people who quit didn't quit merely out of burnout. They quit the stupidity of the managers running this s##tshow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why exactly did they have 47 clusters? One thing I noticed (maybe because I’m not at that scale) is that companies are running 1+ clusters per application. Isn’t the point of kubernetes that you can run your entire infra in a single cluster, and at most you’d need a second cluster for redundancy, and you can spread nodes across regions and AZs and even clouds?I think the bottleneck is networking and how much crosstalk your control nodes can take, but that’s your architecture team’s job?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have 200 YAML files for a single service and 46 clusters I think you're using k8s wrong. And 5 + 3 different monitoring and logging tools could be a symptom of chaos in the organization.k8s, and the go runtime and network stack have been heavily optimized by armies of engineers at Google and big tech, so I am very suspicious of these claims without evidence. Show me the resource usage from k8s component overhead, and the 15 minute to 3 minute deploys and then I'll believe you. And the 200 file YAML or Helm charts so I can understand why in gods name you're doing it that way.This post just needs a lot more details. What are the typical services/workloads running on k8s? What's the end user application?I taught myself k8s in the first month of my first job, and it felt like having super powers. The core concepts are very beautiful, like processes on Linux or JSON APIs over HTTP. And its not too hard to build a CustomResourceDefinition or dive into the various high performance disk and network IO components if you need to.I do hate Helm to some degree but there are alternatives like Kustomize, Jsonnet/Tanka, or Cue https://github.com/cue-labs/cue-by-example/tree/main/003_kub.... You can even manage k8s resources via Terraform or Pulumi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42246883</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I interned at IBM and this was a big deal. IBM was really invested on being "vertically" integrated "from sand to software" as they would say. One wonders what another run at this concept would be like given advances in semiconductor manufacture.I have often wondered if a chip fab that could make 1,000 chips of a given type economically (which is to say using your custom chip in your system was less expensive than adopting an off the shelf chip) would be a thing. The whole 'tiny tapeout' thing would be a lot more interesting too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The degree to which automation is now essential is astounding. Every time a human is on the clean room floor you are burning dollars in terms of defects. For a process node at 3nm and beyond, I don't think you could achieve any yield at all if the automation rate were to fall even a few percent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IBM Microelectronics was a fairly significant fab and semiconductor player until the early 2010s.Remember PowerPCs? That was IBM and was used everywhere from iMacs to Xbox 360s to Thinkpads.Sadly, fabrication became commoditized because of outsourcing to Taiwan and South Korea, who gave unfair advantages to their state adjacent firms like TSMC and Samsung.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260364</guid></item><item><title>26.

DM 30/70 lets the screen's light through, slightly dampened, which is good for use as an art display in the background. And when the screen is off it will look (and be!) an elegant mirror.Put a plant under it on a nice (but cheap) pedestal and upgrade the bookshelf to something more library/furniture, less utilitarian press board.I would suggest textured paint for the wall. Pick light and dark shades of the same color. Paint the light color first. Then paint the dark over it, and lightly use a sponge or crumpled paper to pull just enough off to leave the wall richly colored and textured. It is very classy and calming.I can go on... and on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This exact product won't be available in the US but self adhesive trunking is a neat way to hide cables without cutting or drilling the wall.https://centaurmfg.com/products/16-mm-x-16-mm-pvcu-self-adhe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the type of project I still absolutely love reading about on HN.

Yet Apple cares so little about Ireland that they don't even bother to make a real apple store available.The only thing they care about Ireland for is tax avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a lovely memory, and I think my first mac, a PB 180, was Irish, but if not, the accessories certainly were. And I wonder if the doorstop of a Powermac 8100 still at my childhood home was Irish too.A different world, though. You couldn't find an Apple Mac most places, and I think I possessed the only Mac laptop in the whole of my university.I wonder what Apple Ireland do now, apart from make nefarious plans to avoid tax and make orphans cry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an interview with an unsettlingly fresh-faced Pat Kenny:https://invidious.nerdvpn.de/watch?v=8nLMTmm08o8 -- title is "Steve Jobs opens Apple in Cork City, Ireland 1980", on a channel called CR's Video Vaults.One claim in the video from the presenter is that Ireland had the highest density of Apple users in Europe at the time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42211820</guid></item><item><title>29.

I think he was up around $600K after one year. He was having to get kicked out of small casinos all over the place and keep moving to new ones every few days. At one point he tells the camera crew that he has to start driving 1/2 a day to skip over a few spots to stay ahead of the surveillance. 
 It didn't look easy but not impossible. He got to set his own hours and be his own boss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is card counting still possible, or have casinos implemented enough countermeasures to defeat its advantage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The real story of the whole of the MIT blackjack team is quite something. When you ask someone if they’re still allowed to play in this casino and they reply with “if I use my real name, then yes”.The 80s were a wild time, kids!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253654</guid></item><item><title>30.

I don't think I type more than 50 words a month using a regular keyboard. I still use (half) a keyboard for games, and there are some programs on Windows plover does not work with.  There is an embedded steno engine (javelin-steno) so you don't have to use plover, but I have not set it up yet and just stick to using plover.I write all my code using plover, but I am not a professional programmer. I use emacs most of the time. I use this dictionary for my symbols https://sammdot.ca/steno/emily-symbols.png, this one for 
typing almost any shortcut combination with my left-hand https://github.com/Abkwreu/plover-left-hand-modifiers/blob/m..., as well as this http://www.openstenoproject.org/stenodict/dictionaries/cross... for moving the cursor around and selecting text. The emily-symbol dictionary is fairly popular, and most users will have some set of dictionaries for shortcuts and movement.Its worth noting you can type single letters, so if you don't know a word or don't care to learn it, you can still type the word out. You don't have to memorize every single word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A while back in PyCon UK I met some of the people behind http://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/It’s awesome just how fast and accurate they can be, and most devs were of my mindset “wow can I learn to type like that - it woukd solve this problem and that”Till we found out just how much work is needed to get good. It’s a true skill, and sadly undervalued but something that just has too little pro for the cons - in my opinion as a developer.I already type at faster than I can code, and slightly slower than I can write English.  A better keyboard, or the same keyboard at different workstations and laptops, or some typing tutorials woukd help me - but full on 100wpm is not going to help me debug Kerberos failures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42251040</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the issue of arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in Emacs, a popular text editor, and provides insights on how to mitigate these risks. It explains the mechanics of these vulnerabilities, particularly how poorly designed configurations or plugins can lead to significant security threats. The author offers practical advice for users to enhance their Emacs security, including adopting safer coding practices, utilizing built-in security features, and being cautious with third-party packages. The article aims to raise awareness about these potential risks and encourages users to take proactive steps in securing their Emacs environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256409"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long time Emacs Lisp coder here. Here is a summary of the vulnerability described in the OP:Anyone wishing to inspect an untrusted file of Emacs Lisp code
is likely to use Emacs to do the inspecting, but if 
either of the popular packages Flymake and Flycheck is enabled,
merely opening the untrusted file gives the author of the file
the ability to run arbitrary code (because macros are tricky).
Even if an Emacs user avoids Flymake and Flycheck, the standard
emacs facility for "completing" the names of functions and variables
 has the same basic vulnerability. Specifically, if the user uses Emacs to open the file, then types the start of the name of a function or variable, then types M-tab (i.e., presses the escape key, then presses the tab key) which attempts to fill in the rest of the name so that user does not have to manually type out the whole name, the arbitrary code is run.It is clear to me (who was never tempted to use Flymake or Flycheck) what remediation I want: namely I want this "M-tab" functionality (which I have been using and probably most Emacs users have been using) to refrain completely from expanding any macros even 
though doing so will prevent it from finding out the names of some of the functions
and variables I might be trying to insert with the result that sometimes I will have to type out the full name of the function or variable, without assistance.&gt;AFAICT the earliest public discussion about the security implications of Emacs Lisp macros started in August 2018, when Wilfred Hughes noted that code completion can lead to arbitrary code execution via macro-expansion.The fact that the maintainers have yet to fix this is one more sign added to a list of 5 or 6 other signs that make me want to migrate away from Emacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scary. I saw a tweet the other day from a job seeker who had been sent a repo of seemingly trustworthy code. The sender claimed to be working with a team that was hiring, or something along those lines. Of course, one file deeply nested within the folds of the project contained a block of obfuscated JavaScript designed to grab as much data from the job seeker as possible and transmit it elsewhere. Had the job seeker run the project without reading through it first, they would have been in hot water.You can imagine some variant of this attack including a carefully designed Emacs Lisp payload, which the unsuspecting and desperate-for-a-job victim might open in Emacs. Surprising that the Emacs maintainers didn't fix it as quickly as you'd hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole issue of trusting other peoples code does have a solution besides just not running it: capability based code execution ("Capability-based security" if you want to look it up)Processes can forfeit the permission to do certain things. similarily you could allow functions to forfeit the permission to call certain functions down the callstack (transitively, even) or only allow a function to be called from certain contexts/functions.While certainly a (minor) performance hit when done dynamically, it should be possible,
especially when using an interpreted language. I have not yet seen this done in the context of programming languages, which is probably due to how difficult it would be to set a proper scope and get it right. If A is forbidden from deleting files, for example, but the program allows it to send messages to B (perhaps even by user choice), which is allowed to do so, then that is a natural escape hatch unless B is specifically designed to take this into account. Nonetheless, a hybrid system should be possible to achive, which would at least improve the situation by a non-negligible margin.In the spirit of the original article: Most editor plugins don't need to interact with other processes or the file system directly, and instead could only affect an associated buffer. In this scenario, I believe that it is actually possible to solve this issue. For other applications, such as git integration, the mass of code that would have to be inspected can at least be reduced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256409</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading around online, it seems egress is free until Cloudflare asks for big bucks or threatens to terminate your service. It's probably fine for hobbyists or small web sites. But as a business, I would never trust something that is "free". There has to be a catch somewhere.A business contact of mine asked Cloudflare for a quote for setting up a CDN for 7B requests per month. They dragged him through five sales calls to eventually deliver an offer with request costs 30% above CloudFront's public pricing. He said the costs per GB were ok though.The cheapest reliable CDN I've found is bunny.net. Unlike OP, who is selling a book about Cloudflare, I have no conflict of interest by recommending Bunny, other than being a customer. I serve around 100 TB per month through them, at $0.005/GB. You can put it in front of a bucket to have cheap (globally distributed) egress with all the benefits of your favorite object storage provider. In my case, the buckets lie on Linode/Akamai. Bunny uses CDN77's infrastructure, which I have also heard good things about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing that I haven't seen discussed in the comments is the inherent vulnerability of S3 pricing.  Like all things AWS, if something goes sideways, you are suddenly on the wrong side of a very large bill.  For instance, someone can easily blow your egress charges through the roof by making a massive amount of requests for your assets hosted there.While Cloudflare may reach out and say 'you should be on enterprise' when that happens on R2, the fact they also handle DDoS and similar attacks as part of their offering means the likelihood of success is much lower (as is the final bill).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've benchmarked R2 and S3 and S3 is well ahead in terms of latency especially on ListObject requests. I think R2 has come kind of concurrency limit as concurrent ListObject requests seem to to have increase failure rate when serving simultaneous requestsI have a few of the S3-like wired up live over the internet you can try yourself in your browser. Backblaze is surprisingly performant which I did not expect (S3 is still king though)https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/mps3-vendor-examples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256771</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;ISPs claim that their strong customer service is a key reason why users choose not to switch providers, despite recurring complaints about pricing and service quality in the industry. The article discusses how ISPs emphasize this narrative in response to ongoing criticism and market competition challenges. It examines the underlying factors influencing customer loyalty, including perceived reliability and satisfaction with support, positioning these aspects as critical in maintaining their subscriber base despite dissatisfaction with other service attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

In an industry that is a natural monopoly like last-mile internet delivery, then regulators need to step in and work hard to structure the market such that it actually functions properly, with as much competition as possible.In Australia this had the government own the wires, which rented the capacity to companies, that sold internet service to consumers. An actual functioning market with competition, instead of one company owning all the wires for a town/city/state, refusing to rent them to anyone else, and charging sky high rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I first thought "why did someone submit an onion article", but it is arstechnica.If there was competition fir ISPs, everyone in my area would move off of comcast the first chance they get.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was interesting to see one of the commenters mention Fort Collins Connexion.I've mentioned them a few times on HN with lots of other locals chiming in, but that service was incredible. I was very sad when I moved to an older apartment complex that refused to allow the buildup and had to go back to Comcast for a year before I moved away. Comcast offered 1.2Gb/s down, which was real, but the second anyone did a small upload, the entire network bogged down to actually unusable speeds (read: HN wouldn't load at all).Cheaper and significantly better service from the municipal ISP than mega-corp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42251564</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study that investigates the mechanisms underlying the formation and elimination of synapses in the brain, specifically focusing on the role of astrocytes and their signaling pathways. The researchers demonstrate that astrocytes significantly influence synaptic plasticity and connectivity during development and in response to neuronal activity. By examining the interplay between astrocytes and neurons, the study provides insights into how these cells contribute to neural circuit function and may hold implications for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has been clear for a long time (e.g. Marvin Minsky's early research) that:1. both ANNs and the brain need to solve the credit assignment problem 
2. backprop works well for ANNs but probably isn't how the problem is solved in the brainThis paper is really interesting, but is more a novel theory about how the brain solves the credit assignment problem. The HN title makes it sound like differences between the brain and ANNs were previously unknown and is misleading IMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title of the paper is: "Inferring neural activity before plasticity as a foundation for learning beyond backpropagation"The current HN title ("Brain learning differs fundamentally from artificial intelligence systems") seems very heavily editorialized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not my area of expertise, but this paper may be important for the reason that it is more closely aligned with the “enactive” paradigm of understand brain-body-behavior and learning than a backpropogation-only paradigm.(I like enactive models of perception such as those advocated by Alva Noe, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Valera, and others. They get us well beyond the straightjacket of Cartesian dualism.)Rather than have error signals tweak synaptic weights after a behavior, a cognitive system generates a set of actions it predicts will accommodate needs. This can apparently be accomplished without requiring short term synaptic plasticity. Then if all is good, weights are modified in a secondary phase that is more about asserting utility of the “test” response. More selection than descent. The emphasis is more on feedforward modulation and selection. Clearly there must be error signal feedback  so some if you may argue that the distinction will be blurry at some levels. Agreed.Look forward to reading more carefully to see how far off-base I am.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259185</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods to mitigate WiFi deauthentication attacks, a common security threat to wireless networks. It explains that deauth attacks exploit the 802.11 protocol to disconnect users from their network, potentially allowing attackers to intercept sensitive information. The author suggests using WPA3, implementing 802.1X for network access control, and employing monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity. Additionally, the importance of updating hardware and firmware to ensure security is emphasized. The overall goal is to enhance WiFi security and protect users from unauthorized access and data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience this is a feature of wireless networks that’s been largely forgotten/ignored, and I’m not sure why. It seems that making PMF optional by default would have zero downsides: protect the devices that support it while maintaining compatibility with older devices. 
Question for anyone more knowledgeable on the subject: is there a good reason PMF doesn’t have wider adoption?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typical deauth attacks are prevented, sure. However, clients are not protected until the 4-way handshake is complete, so that can still be interrupted. There are also a number of management frame types (and all control frames) that are not protected, some of which are just as effective, if not more effective, at DoS than deauth frames are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When enabling WPA 3 for a network PMF is set to required by the unifi network server apparently, that’s a nice change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42219749</guid></item><item><title>38.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those interested, I would suggest checking out Spillover by David Quammen. It goes into detail on why eradicating/eliminating zoonotic diseases isn't really feasible without also eradicating the host populations. I stumbled onto it and read it early on during SARS-CoV-2, it will give you a new perspective on the management of disease in general.As for eradicating host populations/mosquitoes, it's not the greatest idea. Ecosystems are complicated and don't generally benefit from that sort of interference. Maybe if it's a recently invasive species, sure, as long as other species don't get inadvertently by-caught. Drastically simplifying - birds need to eat too, and they tried to do this style of ecosystem management in the past and it has had brutally adverse effects for ecosystem stability.I think that this is an incredible development, but also seems kind of destabilizing. It's hard to say without seeming or being callous, that it seems good now, but we need to try to predict outcomes far into the future. That is to say - people think they are smart to have done it, and yeah it's doable, but is it really such a great idea to throw such a series of proverbial monkey wrenches into our proverbial biological engines?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had this idea when I was 7. I would spend all day outside and get tons of mosquito bites, but also sometimes I would go to the doctor to get shots. They seemed to me to be not entirely different things, so I would wonder why they couldn't just put the shots into mosquitos, since they didn't hurt as much.And it turns out, you can!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could not read the whole article because It wanted me to create a account, but it seens very Unethical, inoculating people without their knowledge... .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42229531</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The repository "jsontr.ee" is an open-source project that provides a web-based tool for converting JSON data into a more readable format for better visualization and comprehension. It allows users to paste JSON strings and easily view the structured data, enhancing the user experience by enabling easy navigation and manipulation of JSON objects. The project emphasizes simplicity and usability, making it a helpful resource for developers who need to work with JSON data regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi HN,I’ve been working on JSONtr.ee, a web platform for visualizing and graphing JSON data. While building it, I ended up creating my own lightweight JavaScript library to help anyone convert a JSON file into a schema graph.Before creating this library, I used MermaidJS, but I ran into significant limitations, especially with large and deeply nested JSON objects. My library was built to handle these cases better and to offer more flexibility for customization. After solving my own problem, I decided to make it available for free to anyone who might find it useful.Key features:
Transforms JSON into schema graphs.
Handles large and complex JSON objects seamlessly.
Built with simplicity in mind – dependency-free and easy to integrate.Why I made this:
While working with APIs and large webhook payloads, I struggled to understand nested structures using standard tools. This library makes it easier to visualize the data as a graph and explore it interactively.I’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any ideas for improvement.Thanks for taking a look!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool project and would be super useful with something like GraphQL, which tends to produce big nested JSON objects. Thanks for sharing it!One improvement in my eyes would be to remove the "connector" boxes, like `members (2): "Array"` and `powers (3): "Array"` and have the arrow go straight to the array property. Those connector boxes take up a lot of real estate without conveying new information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beautiful.Single file, 187 lines of JavaScript, no dependencies, does one thing and does it well.I wish there was a way to search for libraries like this one. Almost every time I look for some piece of open source software, I end up writing it myself because all the solutions I find are overcomplicated and try to do too many things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42250921</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The blog post discusses the performance improvements and features of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5) compared to its predecessors. It highlights that the CM5 is approximately 2-3 times faster due to its upgraded hardware specifications. The article also covers the ease of upgrading from earlier models and the potential applications for this enhanced performance, making it a valuable option for developers and hobbyists looking to leverage the latest technology in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty wild to see a drop-in replacement that's actually faster - usually that's marketing speak for "technically compatible but slower in real life." The fact that you can just pop this into existing CM4 hardware and get 2-3x performance is impressive. Finally, my commercial display can run Crysis! (Ok, maybe not, but that USB 3 upgrade is sweet).Though I have to laugh at the "good news everyone, it's the same price!" followed immediately by "...for the 8GB version only, everything else costs more." Classic Pi Foundation pricing gymnastics. At least we're not dealing with scalpers asking $200 for a CM4 anymore.The silkscreen specs on top is such a simple but brilliant addition. No more squinting at tiny chips trying to figure out which module is which in your parts drawer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know if it's a good idea to base a product on Pi CM4/5 (or has experience with this)? I wonder how the availability any price in large quantities is (like 10k per year) and how reliable the connector is in comparison to a soldered SOM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone have any recommendations for a CM carrier board that has ethernet and ~4 sata ports that I can attach external drives to? I'd quite like to build my own NAS but I don't know what board to use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254379</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a unique maritime monument in the northernmost reaches of North America, linked to the Norse exploration of the continent around 1000 AD. Researchers found a series of semi-buried stone structures that may have served as navigational aids or beacons for Viking ships. This finding challenges previous notions about the extent of Norse presence in North America and highlights the complex interactions between Indigenous peoples and Norse explorers. The article emphasizes the importance of these discoveries in understanding the early maritime history and cultural exchanges in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;The British cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth’s widely read twelfth-century History of the Kings of Britain records that Arthur was conceived at Tintagel Castle, the product of a duplicitous union between Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, and Ygerna, Duchess of Cornwall (see “Was There a Real King Arthur?”). Although little is known about Monmouth himself, his epic book propelled him into the role of de facto national historian of England. His Arthurian tales were particularly popular with the literate upper classes. In fact, most of the standing remains visible at Tintagel belong to a thirteenth-century medieval castle that was directly inspired by the legend. One of Europe’s wealthiest men, Richard, Earl of Cornwall and brother of King Henry III, reportedly read Monmouth’s account and was moved to build a romanticized fantasy castle on the supposed spot of King Arthur’s conception.I'm not sure what you call this but the fact that people 8 centuries removed from us build a tourist trap about people 6 centuries removed from them is something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's an impressive sculpture at Tintagel that's meant to  represent King Arthur's ephemeral nature:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallos_(sculpture)Close up, it's quite disturbing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I watched an episode of some show about this place and immediately went to my refrigerator and wrote it down  on my list of places I want to see.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253211</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the unique history of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), a distinct sign language that developed on the island in the 18th century. This form of communication arose in a community with a high incidence of hereditary deafness, leading to a bilingual culture where both hearing and deaf residents used MVSL. The piece highlights how MVSL reflects the island's social dynamics and its eventual decline as the island's population changed and deaf education shifted towards oralism. The article emphasizes the importance of preserving such cultural languages and the insights they provide into local history and community identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the ideas of philosopher Derek Parfit, particularly his views on personal identity, moral philosophy, and the implications of his theories for our understanding of self and ethics. It explores Parfit’s argument that personal identity is not as significant as we might think, suggesting that what matters more are the relationships and connections we have with others. The piece reflects on Parfit's profound influence on contemporary philosophy, particularly regarding how we perceive our own lives and moral responsibilities. It highlights the complexities of his thoughts and how they challenge conventional notions of individuality and moral obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a new approach to enhancing the robustness of machine learning models by employing a method that utilizes a combination of adversarial training and data augmentation techniques. The authors demonstrate that their approach improves model performance in the presence of adversarial attacks while maintaining effectiveness on unperturbed data. Through various experiments on benchmark datasets, the research shows significant gains in both accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods, suggesting that the proposed strategy can effectively address vulnerabilities in machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

This is going to sound pedantic since I know that most popularly-used regex implementations are themselves non-regular, but I feel like we're just piling more and more stuff on top of good-old-regexes and trying to turn the concept into a catch-all for anything that does pattern matching on text.I guess it just feels icky that "regular expressions" has inherent meaning (i.e. can be represented entirely by a finite automaton) which has become completely diluted at this point.That rant aside, cool paper. The idea of bridging formal language theory with modern computational tooling feels timely. I think I would've liked to see more exploration of oracle-based costs, for instance:* What happens when oracle outputs are inconsistent/uncertain?* What happens as oracle interactions become more computationally expensive?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There aren’t many papers on the subject, and I’m probably not great at spotting them. The linked paper also doesn’t mention much recent research, so it seems like an excellent opportunity to ask for the collective wisdom of the HN community - what are your favorite undervalued information retrieval papers after 2015?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article lets an UTF8 symbol be something... so now we have all the existing math symbols + all UTF8 icons. Wonder what the papers be look like in 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245105</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive game called "Jumping Julia Maze," where players navigate a character named Julia through a series of mazes. The objective is to reach the exit while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The site features information about the game mechanics, level design, and tips for players, as well as a user-friendly interface to enhance the gaming experience. It aims to engage users with fun challenges and improve problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wording isn't good. The number does not indicate how many jumps you need to make. It indicates how far you need to jump.Otherwise fun!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love the concept. I was left wanting more because larger puzzles are apparently not more difficult, they just seem to have a lot of solutions. But can we make them more difficult? Just in case anyone else wants more of a challenge... I hand-wrote a 10x10 that should be harder to crack:    1  2  1  2  2  3  1  1  2  2
    3  2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
    3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
    2  1  2  2  3  2  1  1  3  1
    2  1  3  3  1  3  3  1  3  1
    3  3  1  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
    2  3  2  2  2  2  1  2  2  3
    3  3  3  3  1  3  3  1  3  2
    1  3  2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
    2  1  3  3  2  2  2  2  1  F

Unless I made a mistake, the simplest solution is not easy to find. Obviously I was thinking about an algorithm to create harder "Jumping Julia" puzzles. Definitely doable, but for now I'll leave it at that!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to make a server request when Generating a new maze.
Making the maze working fully Client side should be doable..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233953</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article "In Praise of Print: Why Reading Remains Essential in an Era of Epistemological Collapse" emphasizes the enduring importance of print literature in a digital age characterized by misinformation and fragmented attention. It argues that physical books provide a deep, focused reading experience that fosters critical thinking, comprehension, and a sense of permanence, contrasting sharply with the often superficial engagement found online. The piece advocates for the value of print as a means to cultivate a more informed and thoughtful society, encouraging readers to appreciate the tactile and immersive nature of reading in a world overwhelmed by rapid information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The experience of passive consumption (cable TV, tiktok, etc, pointed out in another comment here) is essentially the experience of psychological obliteration.When you get sucked into reels, you go from "here" to "there," and in the process, while you are "there," your entire whole self is destroyed. The same psychological phenomena happens to gambling addicts, alcoholics, or users of heroin. It has fewer physiological downsides and side-effects as those things; the only material loss you have is the loss of time.But far more remarkable than that it's simply a waste of time, and rarely articulated, is this psychological loss. The destruction of the self. That echoes through a person's life, to their relationships, their self-construction, etc. It is those echoes that we are now dealing with on a mass sociological scale.By the way. "There" has a lot of upsides too. People can be creative, productive, expressive while they are "there" too. Creating, being funny, being social, etc. That's why this is so hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just finished reading Amusing Ourselves to Death on the recommendation of some commenters here.Strange that Neil Postman's work is not once mentioned in the article. His basic argument in 1985 was that the shift from print to TV was already causing epistemological collapse through the transforming of not just education, but also news reporting, political discourse, and the functioning of government into forms of entertainment.One thing that stuck out for me was his description of TV news as a "psychotic" series of "Now... this" context switches, where each event had to be over-simplified into a basic narrative that people could grasp within 15-45 seconds, and where the most disturbing story (e.g. a gruesome rape and murder) could be chased up in the next second by a fluff piece about a group of grannies having a bake sale, with no ability of the viewer to reflect on and absorb what they just saw and heard.Viewed that way, the YouTube algorithm and TikTok represent a natural progression of the way that TV news has already primed us to consume information. In fact, almost all of the arguments made in Amusing Ourselves to Death have only become more relevant in the age of social media. More than ever, we are losing our ability to place information in context, to think deeply, and to tolerate what makes us uncomfortable. No doubt these things would be reflected in test scores.On the other hand, the one possible saving grace of an internet world vs. a TV world could be the relaxing of the restrictive time and ratings constraints. I would argue there are niche content producers out there doing better contextualizing, deeper thinking, and harder-hitting investigative work than was ever possible on TV, and that this content is hypothetically available to us. The only question is: are we able to withstand the firehose of highly available, highly irrelevant short-form dopamine hit entertainment in order to find it? On the contrary, I think most of us are getting swept up in the firehose every day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title and apparent argument of this confound me somewhat. For those of us who read many, many books very frequently, but stick mostly to digital versions simply out of space and access convenience, it's not hard to feel as if we're somehow being looked down upon because we're not hauling around a bundle of weighty tomes..Why should print be so specifically necessary if a book's content is what defines it? That I might read, say, Umberto Eco, in digital makes it no less intellectually valuable than if I bought a paperback version, or if you want to get really fancy about things, a hard cover, if those are still even released...If anything, being able to carry hundreds of books of all kinds around with me nearly anywhere on my Kindle, or even on my cell phone, makes it all the easier to read more voraciously. With this it requires no extra effort beyond that of having with you a device that you'd in any case carry, and thus taking advantage of many more spare moments between daily activities..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42263834</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do think that voice cloning for personal usage has actual genuine uses - in fact there was a relatively interesting news article about a person who was irrevocably losing their voice who had their vocal pattern cloned.https://www.voanews.com/a/illness-took-away-her-voice-ai-cre...That being said, it does seem a bit bizarre that the repo's home page is proudly trumpeting the ability to co-opt other people's identities without their permission (and yes your unique vocal pattern is definitely part of your identity - I mean it's used in some forms of biometric data). They're doing the project a bit of a disservice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing this! But I have some doubts about hidden installation procedures. It imports all functions from one_click (from one_click import *), which points to a compiled file. It then runs functions like install_webui and install_extra_packages. At least suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Windows Defender may give a warning about untrusted application and disallow further execution of Voice-Pro. If SmartScreen security level is set to "Warn", just click "More info" and then click "Run anyway". If SmartScreen is set to level "Block" there will be no button to run the installation. In this case, open the properties of the start.bat file, and check "Unblock", apply the change and run the start.bat again.https://github.com/abus-aikorea/voice-pro?tab=readme-ov-file...hard pass and anyone who reads this and continues is bonkers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261909</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This one is crazy. I made up a silly topology problem which I guessed wouldn't be in a textbook (given X create a shape with Euler characteristic X) and set it to work. Its first effort was a program that randomly generated shapes, calculated X and hoped it was right. I went and figured out a solution and gave it a clue.Watching it "think" through the answer is surreal and something I haven't felt since watching GPT-2 write punchlines for jokes.Here's the lightbulb moment it "realizes" what the clue meant:&gt; For example, if you have a covering space of degree n, then the Euler characteristic of the covering space is n times the Euler characteristic of the base space.&gt; But I'm not sure how that relates here.&gt; Alternatively, perhaps it's about considering the Euler characteristic of a quotient space.&gt; But again, that might be too advanced for this problem.&gt; Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.&gt; Let me go back to the beginning.&gt; The problem says: "Consider the Euler characteristic of the tetrahemihexahedron and of a genus g torus. Then consider the additive property of the Euler characteristic. Then try again."&gt; So, perhaps it's simply about adding their Euler characteristics together.I'm under no illusions about how LLMs are built and operate, but this really feels somehow more "real" and person-y than previous generations, even when you coax them into an answer.I'm going to go and try having GPT-4o roleplay a student solving the problem and see if it's genuinely different. I've been getting impressive answers from o1, but just coldly getting the result is much more robot than human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This one is pretty impressive. I'm running it on my Mac via Ollama - only a 20GB download, tokens spit out pretty fast and my initial prompts have shown some good results. Notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/qwq/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;QwQ can solve a reverse engineering problem [0] in one go that only o1-preview and o1-mini have been able to solve in my tests so far. Impressive, especially since the reasoning isn't hidden as it is with o1-preview.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41524263&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259184</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an example of how we've used this.RStudio Server[0] 1.3 and older hard-coded a number of paths, such as the path for storing temporary files: Instead of looking for the TMPDIR environment variable (as specified by POSIX[1]), R Studio Server would always use /tmp.  That is extremely annoying, because we set TMPDIR to a path on fast local storage (SATA or NVMe SSDs) that the job scheduler cleans up at the end of the compute job.We do have a last-resort mechanism using pam_namespace[2], such that a user going to `/tmp` actually takes them to `/namespace/tmp/${username}`, but that is per-user, not per-job.  If a user has two R Studio jobs, and those two jobs landed on the same host, there would be trouble.So, we used PRoot to wrap R Studio, with /tmp bind-mounted to a directory under TMPDIR.[0]: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/[1]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1...[2]: https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_namespace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`guix pack` can create bundles that use a static proot to make them relocatable:https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2017/10/using-guix-without-being-...It also supports other more performant ways, but in some situations proot is the best choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A similar tool for this user-space bind-mount is https://github.com/fritzw/ld-preload-open, which relies on LD_PRELOAD to overwrite common libc functions. Thus this is less reliable as the presented tool which uses ptrace, but it still works reasonably well (I run e.g. PyCharm with it).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262308</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The Aluminum Bike Project by Sheldon Brown details a DIY initiative to build a unique bicycle from aluminum tubing. The project outlines the materials, tools, and techniques required for the construction, along with step-by-step guidance and illustrations. It emphasizes the advantages of aluminum as a lightweight and durable material for bike frames while also sharing personal insights and experiences from the building process. This resource serves as a practical how-to guide for enthusiasts interested in custom bike fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; He ruled out magnesium, which is best per unit weight in compressive buckling but is brittle and difficult to extrude.There's a fascinating, and very new, class of nano-laminate magnesium alloys called Long Period Stacking-Ordered (LPSO) alloys.  These are very lean -- the standard version is 97% Mg + 1% Zn + 2% Y -- and they have outstanding mechanical properties.  At an equal weight, they're much stronger and stiffer than 6061 aluminum, and the kicker is that this is generally true only if they're extruded.  If they're not extruded, the laminate-like grain structure doesn't form properly.Could make excellent bike frames.Magnesium corrosion would still be a problem, though.  I got some LPSO-Mg samples from Fuji Light Metals, in Japan, and they were quite badly degraded within weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;R.I.P. Sheldon Brown. I'm glad his pages still exist both as useful resource and as a time capsule of what the best of the old web looked like: useful, content rich, no ads, fast loading, stable urls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting that trackies in the 70s were trying to reduce weight that much.  I don't think it's perceived as especially advantageous these days.  The high-ish end track bike I'm assembling now will be a little over 8 kg (almost 18 lb).  We also race much bigger gears (typically 95-110 gear inches in mass start racing, bigger for sprinting) than mentioned in the article (72 gear inches).  The position that is considered aerodynamic is also much different -- there is much less focus on getting that insanely low, and instead the focus is on being narrow and getting the forearms parallel with the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261053</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a novel approach to the study of the dynamics of coupled systems, emphasizing the significance of non-linear interactions and their impact on collective behavior. It introduces advanced mathematical models to better understand how these dynamics can lead to emergent phenomena in various contexts, including biological and social systems. The authors discuss theoretical implications as well as potential applications of their findings, aiming to provide deeper insights into the role of coupling strength and the nature of interactions within complex systems. The work contributes to the existing body of research by offering a fresh perspective on the interplay between individual and collective behaviors in coupled networks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statement from the City of London Corporation which is closing them down:&gt; Chris Hayward, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said the
&gt; decision represented a "positive new chapter" for the markets as it "empowers
&gt; traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their
&gt; long-term business goals".This is a great statement. Like firing people to free them up to find jobs that better align with their desire for employment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took this long?Paris closed Les Halles in 1973.[1]New York's Fulton Fish Market moved in 2005.[2]A wholesale food market is a transportation hub. It needs good road access. 
If you can't easily get semitrailer trucks to it, it's in the wrong place.
At one time Smithfield was served by underground freight rail, but that shut down long ago.
Smithfield has a setup where maybe eight semis can parallel park on the street and back up to loading docks.
Hunts Point Market in New York has space for over a thousand.It's the end of an era, though. One of the last of the big public markets.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Halles[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_Fish_Market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bit misleading about Billingsgate fish market. They shut the real Billingsgate fish market next to London bridge a long time ago and moved it to canary wharf. The fact is London has changed a lot in 850 years and it probably doesn’t really make that much sense to have a wholesale meat market right in Farringdon any more, or even at all, when wholesale buyers can just order what they need direct from suppliers and have it shipped directly to them rather than gathering flies at an open market for a few hours somewhere in the middle because TRADITION.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260027</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get irrationally angry when a map is skewed in this way and there is no way to change it.  The more you zoom in, the worse the distortion is made to be.  Even zooming all the way out does not eliminate the angular distortion.  This took actual effort on some programmer's part!  Who ever thought that this is a good idea?!?It's like those navigational mini maps (car or computer game) that won't keep north pointing up... only worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When looking at France, at a zoom level where one can see the whole country, all the green dots are located next to nuclear power plants. It's a good reminder that the french grid is mostly powered by nuclear.It'd be nice to see the same map over summer to see if the different electric mix then gives birth to a different map.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A specialty in austria (in the middle of the map) is pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Since there are so many mountains and valleys, lakes are used as giant batteries. Water can be pumped up in times of excessive supply and released to produce energy when there's higher demand.This keeps the power lines stable and compensates for factors like lack of wind in wind power stations, startup/shutdown times of thermal power plants, differing consumption patterns because of colder weather etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42265533</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concepts of structured editing and incremental parsing in the context of programming and text manipulation. The author explains how structured editing allows for modifications to be made to data structures while maintaining their integrity, promoting a more semantic approach to editing content. Incremental parsing, on the other hand, focuses on updating a parse tree as changes are made, rather than re-parsing the entire structure, thus enhancing performance and responsiveness in applications. The article highlights the benefits of these techniques in improving the efficiency and user experience of text editors and development environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not extremely familiar with the details of incremental parsing, but I have used Cursorless, a VSCode extension based on tree-sitter for voice controlled structured editing, and it is pretty powerful. You can use the structured editing when you want and also normal editing in between. Occasionally the parser will get things wrong and only change/take/select part of a function or what have you, but in general it's very useful, and I tend to miss it now that I am no longer voice coding much.  I seem to remember that there was a similar extension for emacs (sans voice control). treemacs, or something? Anyone used that?[0] https://www.cursorless.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trying to use any kind of syntax highlighter with TeX is a pain in the butt. I didn't mean LaTeX there. I mean TeX, which can rewrite it's own lexer, and a lot of libraries work by doing so. I move in and out of TeXInfo syntax and it basically just causes most editors to sit there screaming that everything is broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did some work on structural editing a while back, using Tree-sitter to get the AST (abstract syntax tree, the parse tree used for structural edits). I now use the editor as my daily driver but don't use or feel the need for structural editing commands that often - probably partly out of habit and partly because text edits are just better for most editing.I do miss the "wrap" command when using other editors, but it could be implemented reasonably easily without a parse tree. I found that a lot of the structural edits correspond to indentation levels anyway, but the parse tree definitely helps.HN post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29787861&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259547</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article analyzes BootKitty, the first known UEFI bootkit targeting Linux systems. It discusses how this bootkit operates by manipulating the UEFI firmware to gain persistence and execute malicious code before the operating system loads. The researchers detail the techniques used by BootKitty to bypass security measures, its potential impact on cybersecurity, and the importance of securing the UEFI environment to prevent such attacks. The analysis emphasizes the growing threats to Linux systems and the need for robust security solutions that address UEFI vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The researchers are keen to note things about this, but also likely want to avoid giving attackers "more ideas", which I feel limits the discussion. Plus, I highly doubt these attackers don't know everything we should be discussing.This is obviously a low hanging fruit and first PoC implementation. The fact that secure boot can "mitigate" some of this attack right now is mostly due to the attacker being lazy or deploying an unfinished product. The researchers describe this as "unless they install the attackers certificate", which is a nice way of saying that the attacker has not spent much time fishing through DKMS and abusing the keys used for this purpose.There are a lot of systems that are affected by this type of attack because for various purposes they have to sign their own modules. The most common example of this (until extremely recently, sort of) is Nvidia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's kinda ridiculous reading the comments in here.This is a persistence stage exploit mechanism, meaning in order to install it, privilege escalation happened before that and it already got root rights.The people here that claim "secureboot prevented that". No, it didn't. A simple call to sbctl to sign the rootkit is missing, because, as every Linux device, you will have to have the signature keys available locally. Otherwise you can never update your kernel.That is the conceptual issue that cannot be fixed, and also not with TPM or whatever obscurity mechanism in between.Linux needs to be a rootless system, meaning that there needs to be a read only partition that root can never read. That would limit access to this kind of thing to physical access or the kernel ring at the very least. Technically, this was the intent of efivarfs, but look at where vendor firmware bugs got us with this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this a rather interesting read, nice.I cannot help but think the move to UEFI and Secure Boot made things less secure :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264345</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;MyPhotos is a platform designed to help users organize, store, and share their photographs efficiently. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to upload images, categorize them into albums, and access them from any device. The site emphasizes privacy and security, ensuring that users can control who sees their photos. Additionally, MyPhotos provides options for collaboration, enabling users to share albums with friends and family, making it a practical solution for both personal and professional photo management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My mom is an avid traveler who takes a ton of photos and puts them on albums she then shares with the family, and a while ago she was asking if I had a solution so she could have a website where all her albums are listed. She wanted to not have to share a new link each time, and have people easily look up older ones.I didn't have any easy solution and this looks promising, congrats!A few dealbreaker things I can share:- she has lots of albums already on gphoto. She'd need to easily import them.- she makes heavy use of the map and text blocks you can add in gphoto albums, which makes each album a kind of travel diary. I don't get the sense these are supported in your product yet, these would be required for her.- she doesn't have a ton of videos but sometimes she does have a few.- I'd have some concerns about the longevity of your product - if she invests time into it she wants to be able to look back at the albums in 10-20 years time. Having a convenient way to export the albums would be reassuring to me.- I think she has a few 1000s photos in those albums, so your highest tier would be too low for her, if there was a way to buy storage that might suit her usage better (though she has a hobbyist budget).It might be technically difficult and you rejected that path already, but I'm thinking an ideal way for her would be to keep editing her albums in gphotos and sync them to your site, which would take care of the longevity concerns and allow her to keep using the interface she knows (if you  linked directly to the pics/vids on google server that would eliminate the cost of storing pictures for you, but I assume that's impossible or prohibited by google's tos).Anyway, just sharing my use case in case that's useful but congrats on launching and on the good looking product!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great website and the pricing makes sense. Some links still go to gphotos.site (automatic redirected). I tried so see how easy the iframe feature is, or rather if a non-technical person would understand the documentation. But the guides seem to be mostly AI generated SEO. Quickly the good impression of personal photos from genuine authors of the website turned into gen-AI slob https://www.myphotos.site/platforms/wordpress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;such a cute idea!
But in this social media age, does anyone actually visit a website?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264344</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a unique concept from 1970: a washing machine designed specifically for humans, presented by industrial designer Peter S. Hunt. This innovative design envisioned a large, cylindrical machine that allowed users to enter inside for cleansing, similar to how clothing is washed. Featuring a transparent exterior, the machine utilized water jets and powered brushes for an immersive cleaning experience. The piece highlights the imaginative and unconventional approach to personal hygiene during that era, showcasing the blend of design and practicality while prompting reflections on the evolution of personal care technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; After five minutes of that, the machine would then fill the chamber with hot water for a three-minute ultrasonic bath. This was followed by a two-minute hot rinse cycle. Next, the chamber would drain and the user was blasted with warm air to dry off. They were additionally exposed to both infrared and ultraviolet light to kill germs. All in all, it was a 15-minute cycle.It's apparently also a tanning booth.15 minutes means it takes about 3 times longer than a shower, and it doesn't seem to do your hair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before I clicked through, I was hoping this was going to be about right-to-repair washing machines for clothing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a severely handicapped adult son and would very much like one of these. I ended up having one of those sit-down tubs for senior citizens installed for a mere $17,000 but this would be better.

I empathize with the complaining but if the new price is such a ripoff everyone should be recommending what cloud VM provider they're migrating to for a better deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While all the guesswork ? They explain clearly why this is happening. And it seems fair."With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our customers around the world as fair as possible. To do that, we will calculate our prices based on local conditions in Europe, Singapore, and the USA. Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best possible price for the resources they use."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to make things more balanced.I may know one of the culprits -- whom I will leave unnamed here.  But the company, who is fairly popular, built out their own CDN via putting a bunch of nginx caching proxies on various Hetzner servers around the world.  It apparently was really cheap and very effective.  Given that they were bootstrapped and this was prior to Cloudflare really being that popular, it was a great strategy.  This was true like 8 years ago, so maybe it has changed in the meantime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264427</guid></item><item><title>20.

Perhaps they figured this had a low likelihood of being the source of domestic microbes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  opened in nitrogen in a class 10,000 clean roomSince these samples were collected in a vacuum, doesn't it make sense to keep them in a vacuum, at least for science that requires the smallest possible amount of contamination?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems then sample analysis should happen in place instead of bringing samples back to study. I think this motivates the need for better ISS equipment, or off-site research labs, like on the moon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42238603</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an exposition of the ideas and results of conversational game theory in the format and authorial style of an academic paper? Even if there is no intention to submit it to e.g. neurips, creating and prominently linking to such a pdf could help not only to refine the ideas but to communicate to outsiders. The linked website takes a while to get to the point and filled up my crank-o-meter before I got answers to basic questions like “what loss are the agents trained on” or “what do you think the equilibrium of this game is and why do you think that.” The field has settled on the (paper, github, blog post) link triplet for good reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm having trouble understanding all the upvotes for a wall of buzzwords from across-fields. Would love to understand what this even is in plain english if somebody has the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a 77 minutes video in the Project Reviews page from the menu of the left. Maybe there is a demo in there but I didn't bother to check. It's conversational, it's text based, why didn't they include a textual demo in a page?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42263239</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Hetzner's recent decision to raise prices while simultaneously reducing bandwidth allocations for its US customers. It highlights the implications of these changes on users, particularly for those reliant on high data usage. The author expresses concerns about the impact of these adjustments on the service's competitiveness and customer satisfaction, as well as potential reasons behind Hetzner's strategic shift. Overall, the piece reflects on the challenges facing current and prospective clients in light of these new pricing and bandwidth structures.&lt;/p&gt;

Johan the dev here, thanks for all the positive responses. Happy to answer any questions about picoCAD if there are any.You can also check out https://picoCAD.net for more info :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve tried other 3d modeling software (blender, fusion, etc) and picocad is the only one I’ve been able to actually pick up and use without unsuccessfully spending hours watching outdated tutorials. I understand it’s not apples to apples. Just wanted to say thanks and this is an awesome tool!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For folks who want a regular (not low-poly) modeler which is a small/light-weight download, Dune 3D seems the best thing to try:https://dune3d.org/Previous discussions:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37979758https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40228068The other notable thing to try is Solvespace or maybe NASA's Open Vehicle SketchPad (for opensource)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262734</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is a nice way to clarify the different use cases for version numbers:- SemVer is a communication tool for when an author needs to tell a potential user what to expect from a new version.- TrunkVer is an auditing/engineering tool for when you need to give a unique identifier to a version for technical reasons.I think this page is a nice codification of a useful practice, but it does itself a disservice by positioning itself against SemVar and claiming to be a "drop-in" replacement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what way is this „SemVer-compatible“ when you just ignore the „Major increment &lt;=&gt; breaking changes“ convention? It has 3 numbers separated by dots? This just increments major version every time a build is started, even though there might not be breaking changes.Edit: When looking at the SemVer page: https://semver.org/#if-even-the-tiniest-backward-incompatibl...The formal spec technically only tells you that you MUST increment Major for breaking changes, and not that you can’t do it every time, but the FAQ makes it clear what the spirit of the rule is. I can’t see how TrunkVer can be called SemVer compatible with this construction method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been happily using date base version numbers in any user facing product (e.g apps) for a while now. It’s been great.While semver makes great sense on paper, and even allows nifty little algebras in dependency declarations, it is been my experience that the delineations are not always as easy to decode and different team members can quibble over the exact realization of the boundaries.Furthermore, it’s very much been my experience that semver changes, like all code comments, only communicate the intent of the developer and not always the reality. A minor roll may be anticipated as backwards compatible, until an unrealized use case pops up and makes the minor change very breaking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259604</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The social hierarchy of hyenas is even more rigid and predictable, with a depth of more than 100 layersI would like to read more about this. The largest known hyena pack [0] is about 130, with most being smaller. So we can say this claim is almost equivalent to saying there's a total ordering of the hyena pack, where between any two animals the seniority is clear. Reading the article supports this interpretation.Sorting 100 things is a difficult feat of computation! How does every hyena in the pack remember its relative place in the hierarchy? How do updates to the hierarchy (presumably it's not strict unchanging seniority order) happen, and how do they get propagated through the pack? If hyena A sees a lower-ranked hyena B exert dominance over a higher one C, how does it now update its place in the pecking order vs B or C?Perhaps this is out of scope for the statistics paper, but it's one for the people who like to develop theories of computation inspired by the animal world.[0] https://ideas.ted.com/everything-you-know-about-hyenas-is-wr...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When looking at the pre-1914 world, it's amazing how much they tried to introduce (propagate?) artificial total orders: if you have a bishop and a baron over for dinner, who gets served first, that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skimming the paper (which honestly I am still trying to understand), the paper authors suggest that the "depth of competition" parameter can be understood as "a measure of the imbalance in strength or skill between the average pair of players".In other words, it's statement about the skill/strength/power distribution of your population of players.As I understood it, the general model they are working with (Bradley-Terry) is about how to take a set of win/loss measurements amongst a fixed set of participants, and then try to predict the win/loss probability of unobserved competitions (and I guess also allow you to generate rankings).Intuitively, I think you can imagine how you could take that type of observation and build out a ranking of participants basically through a series of pairwise comparisons on win/loss rates. But then when it comes time to predict the win/loss ratio of an unobserved competition, you're forced to make assumptions about how to model/extrapolate win/loss ratios. This depth of competition parameter would be part of that extrapolation.EDIT: Just a thought, I think it's fun to consider the language around "depth of competition". The paper uses "deep" to mean there is a strong gradient in strength. But when we often talk about "depth" in sports, we typically say that "deep" teams or "deep" leagues have a swallow gradient. Think about teams having "deep benches".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212745</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;NASA aircraft have discovered the location of secret Cold War nuclear missile tunnels beneath the Greenland ice sheet. This finding highlights the remnants of a clandestine military operation from the 1950s and 1960s, revealing how the U.S. sought to develop and deploy nuclear capabilities during the Cold War. The research utilizes advanced radar technology to penetrate through the ice, uncovering structures that were previously hidden and not documented, providing new insights into historical military infrastructure and geological impacts on the region.&lt;/p&gt;

Being there, hearing, feeling, and seeing those 10,000HP monsters fly down the track is worthy of experiencing live, at least once. The kind of thing you can't watch on TV.I can say the same for a Monster Truck rally. Go there and embrace your inner 10 year old watching those machines Move. (And, boy, can they move!)Bring earplugs.There's more to the sports than the pinnacle of achievement. There are innumerable classes within drag racing, something for everyone. It's not a "solved" problem by any means. Folks will continue to try and master the start, getting traction, keeping that beastly powered thing straight in the lane, trying to not choke on their beating heart that has surged into their throat.Bracket racing is a hoot where folks bring whatever they like, and they're rated by time (i.e. a "time bracket"). Whether you're running a old 60's hot rod, a Jet Powered car, or anything else, if you can run within the time, it's pretty much fair game. And it can be fun to watch, and real fun to participate in.Racing of all kinds can be a fun culture to be around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article seemed to go on and on and not have a real point...but on the topic:Hot-rodding is dying. Let's think about that.V8's are dying. Dodge was the first to stop putting them in cars.Mustang sales are at low levels. The Camaro is gone.Ford doesn't allow tuning of the current Mustang (asterisk for approved Whipple/Ford Racing parts). GM tried locking people out of the new Corvette but they eventually got into it.Tuning hardware+software companies have been raided by the US government. Most of this is due to the diesel truck crowd.The manual transmission is pretty much dead. Sure, the current 8/9/10 speed automatics are faster and get better mileage, but a lot of people still prefer a stick shift.Drag strips are closing. Housing gets built near them, the events make too much noise, and the land is too valuable to be used as racetrack which doesn't really make much money.Lastly, the younger generations aren't into cars as a hobby/culture like the previous ones were. They don't drive as much and view cars as more of an appliance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was impressed by the author they managed to find for this piece, Rachel Kushner. She's an accomplished novelist who writes with deep knowledge about motorcycles, as in her novel The Flamethrowers (how I was introduced to her writing). She's at the level that you might expect to find a long interview with her in the New Yorker.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the construction of a phosphorescence detector, detailing the materials and methods used in its development. It highlights the principles of phosphorescence, the importance of detecting light emitted by certain materials after the excitation source is removed, and provides step-by-step instructions for assembling the detector with an emphasis on the underlying science. Through practical examples and detailed explanations, the piece serves as a guide for DIY enthusiasts and researchers interested in fluorescence and phosphorescence detection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be interesting to replicate this with a shorter wavelength. I tried doing some stuff with UV LEDs but was frustrated by how inefficient they were. Bog standard 385nm "UV" LEDs emit so much blue light that weak fluorescence was easily washed out. I wonder if that could be messing with your calibration (or even if the extra blue light could be doing some sort of quenching).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh this is lcamtuf, i was wondering why i liked the prose. On topic: they make uv lasers, i imagine these can be pulsed and have a fast off time. Peanut butter does glow after being hit with strong UV (like a UV flashlight with a COB UV LED in it, as opposed to these little thru-hole LEDs.)I was curious why not use a darlington transistor right on the back of the photodiode? what's the adc say if you read the photodiode while the UV lights are on?Well, they won't read this, probably. So i guess i'll have to rig up something similar and see for myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261538</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;Pras Michel, a member of the hip-hop group Fugees, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison following his conviction on charges related to conspiracy and other crimes involving foreign influence in U.S. politics. The case highlighted Michel's connections with international figures, including a fugitive Malaysian financier, and his attempts to influence U.S. political outcomes. The sentencing reflects the seriousness of the violations, which include illegal campaign contributions and attempts to lobby for the return of a fugitive. Michel's legal team plans to appeal the decision, arguing that the prosecution was flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explains how to generate video sprites using FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework. It details the process of creating a single image file that contains a grid of thumbnail images, representing different frames from a video. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on using specific FFmpeg commands to extract frames at set intervals and compile them into a sprite sheet. This technique is useful for web developers and designers looking to improve loading times and optimize video content for user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it common to call these sprites in British English? I would call them "thumbnails".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A long time ago, we used this approach to play videos at 15 fps in IE6, with no flash or realplayer plugins required!  No sound though...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used vcs[0] to make contact sheets from videos.  It has a nice feature that if it detects the frame is blacked out, it will shift the capture time so every frame on the sheet has something to look at.  Easy syntax to set capture at every delta or capture x number of frames evenly distanced, columns per row, ignore a set length of end time, and frame size.[0] https://p.outlyer.net/vcs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42258407</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really cool solution! One question: maybe I missed it, but there's no technical reason the tag bits could not use the entire range of exponent bits, no? Other than the fact that having up to 2048 tags would be ridiculously branchy, I guess.Here's a variation I just thought of, which probably has a few footguns I'm overlooking right now: use the seven highest exponent bits instead of three. Then we can directly read the most significant byte of a double, skipping the need for a rotation altogether.After reading the most significant byte, subtract 16 (or 0b00010000) from it, then mask out the sign. To test for unboxed doubles, test if the resulting value is bigger than 15. If so, it is an unboxed double, otherwise the lower four bits of the byte are available as alternative tags (so 16 tags).Effectively, we adjusted the exponent range 2⁻⁷⁶⁷..2⁻⁵¹¹ into the 0b(0)0000000 - 0b(0)0001111 range and made them boxed doubles. Every other double, which is 15/16th of all possible doubles, is now unboxed. This includes subnormals, zero, all NaN encodings (so it even can exist in superposition with a NaN or NuN tagging system I guess?) and both infinities.To be clear, this is off the top of my head so maybe I made a few crucial mistakes here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I doubt this is actually faster than NaN or why they call NuN tagging. The code sequences they cite for encoding and decoding are worse than what I expect NuN tagging to give you.If they want to convince me that their thing is faster, they should do a comparison against a production implementation of NuN tagging. Note that the specifics of getting it right involve wacky register allocation tricks on x86 and super careful instruction selection on arm.It seems that they use some very nonstandard JS implementation of NaN tagging as a strawman comparison.(Source: I wrote a lot of the NuN tagging optimizations in JavaScriptCore, but I didn’t invent the technique.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved this clever, weird, awesome paper, so a short summary.In many dynamic languages some values are stored on the heap ("boxed") and represented as a pointer, while others are represented as an immediate value ("unboxed" or "immediate"). Pointer tagging is a common way to do that: the low bit of the value tells you the value's type, and some types are immediate while others are boxed.Naturally, the tag bits have a fixed value, so can't be used to store data. So for example your language might offer 61-bit integer immediates instead of 64-bit integers; the other three bits are used for tags. Possibly, larger integers are stored on the heap and treated as a different type (for example Python 2.X had separate int and long types for these cases).However, it's hard to use this strategy for floats, because floats need all 64 bits (or 32 bits for single-precision, same difference). There's a trick called "NaN boxing" which makes use of the large number of NaNs in the float representation, but read the paper if you want more on that.The authors' insight is that, suppose you have a three-bit tag and 011 is the tag for floats. By totally random chance, _some_ floats will end in 011; you can represent those as immediates with those tag bits. Obviously, that's unlikely, though you can raise the chances by using, like, 010, 011, 100, and 101 all as float tags. Still, the low bits are a bad choice. But what about high bits? Most floats have one of a couple high bit patterns, because most floats are either 0 or between, say, 1e-100 and 1e100. Floats outside that range can be boxed but since they're really rare it's not a big cost to box them.So basically, we use high bits as our tag bits and map all the common float prefixes to float tags. This allows unboxing the vast majority of floats, which leads to big speedups on float-heavy benchmarks.A personal note: I've been working in numerics and floating-point for a decade now and have had to deal with float boxing both from a research point of view (lots of runtime analysis systems for floats), from a user point of view (using unboxed float vectors for significant speedup in my own software), and from a teaching point of view (discussing boxing in my compilers class, using NaN-boxing as an example of cleverness).This idea is so simple, so crazy, so stupid, and works so well, but I never thought of it. Bravo to the authors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249609</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article reports that the Australian Parliament has passed a bill imposing an age ban on social media platforms, requiring users to verify their age to access these services. This legislation aims to enhance the safety of children online by preventing minors from accessing inappropriate content. The move has sparked discussions about potential implications for privacy and freedom of expression while seeking to protect younger audiences from the risks associated with social media use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every single Australian's ID will have to be verified (in order to confirm their age).Depending on the degree of cooperation (/coercion) the Australian government has with social media companies, the Aus Govt will be able to access citizen social media data with relative ease. So no more pseudo anonymous accounts (or, at least, they'll be made more difficult, especially for non-technical folk).Reminds of the 'chilling effect' of measures of bygone decades.My personal hunch is legacy media is largely driving this, due to them seeing the writing on the wall and knowing 'social media' is their biggest threat. If young people get their information from sites like bluesky, twitter, podcasts and reddit, they may never watch a mainstream news program or read an online newspaper. Bad for business. This measure is a great way of eradicating some competition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like the spirit, dislike the execution.Passing legislation to “protect the kids” is politically easy. Bans are simple. Much more effective, IMO, would be to legislate the way social networks behave. Stop their most addictive patterns. Adults are just as susceptible as kids in my experience. If there needs to be anything kid specific, perhaps a block on using the service during school hours, or only for X hours a day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re tempted to think “this isn’t worth it, too hard to enforce without affecting something else”… read “The Anxious Generation” by Jonathan Haidt. There is very real, irreparable harm being done to young people, and it merits trying to make it right, not just surrendering to it.Surely the problem of verifying a property of someone (the Boolean of “is over X age”) without sharing further details, is a surmountable problem given all the cryptographic technologies at our disposal. If a government wants to make this possible, given they know everyone’s birthdate, they could.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264733</guid></item><item><title>37.

And programming languages are a communication technology, they're means to communicate ideas to other programmers.Love this. May be I should repost this every time there is an argument about Rust. And to expand on that, in communication technology, the one easier to use is going to get wider spread / adoption. And while there were never much hype around Go, I think it is a very good example.But a lot of Rust [1] ideas are now being polished and used elsewhere like Swift. I am sure we will continue to be experimented in other languages and real world to test whether the trade off is worthwhile.[1] ( ok may be Cyclone or something earlier in case someone wants to nitpick )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This maps to my own experience in the UK. Every time I search for a C++ job, I inevitably end up discussing my fondness of Rust but inability to use it at work. The interviewer will typically reply mentioning discussions of using it for greenfield projects - but I know it won't result in me writing anything of substance.2 years ago, seeing a somewhat applicable Rust job-description made me 90% certain it was about cryptocurrency fintech. Now, a few defence roles are creeping in, presumably due to the US government distancing itself from unsafe languages. Neither are fields I really want to work in. And what a shame it would be if such a great language was relegated to being an Ada alternative.I try to keep on top of Rust, - it's the most likely candidate to put me out of a job - but it will be a long time before there are no more legacy C++ codebases. Being the COBOL guy of the future doesn't sound too bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is kind of silly to me. You don't have to break up with Rust to use C++.Look for opportunities to adopt Rust, especially greenfield projects. We don't have to eliminate all C++ codebases first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42268819</guid></item><item><title>38.

The thing you notice in that country is that there are a lot of animals and the animals behave differently when they see you than animals almost anywhere else. They’ve never seen a human before, for generations, and so you are a novelty in their environment that they know nothing about.Interestingly, humans (without canids) apparently don’t come across as much of a threat by default. I would be approached by curious animals that in any other environment would never allow themselves to be remotely that close to a human. For lack of a better description, these animals also had much more “personality” than the wild animals you see near civilization.Until you’ve seen the actual wilds, it is easy to forget how much of the “wilds” are actually quite zoo-like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Book recommendation for The World Without Us which explores what might happen if humans vanished overnight: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Without_Us&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This documentary explores this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l11zPNb-MFg

Usually closing chrome results in an immediate ~10% performance boost even minimised.. I’d love to see an option for a Developer to lock off some cores totally, nothing runs on them unless its in an approved list.. At least then I can profile on those cores and  get a reasonable result..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These workarounds might be good enough to detect ~1-5% changes from a baseline of a native, pre-compiled application. However this won't be sufficient for many dynamic, JIT-compiled languages which will usually still have large amounts of inter-run variance due to timing-sensitive compilation choices of the runtime. A statically significant ~10% change can be hard to detect in these circumstances from a single run.In my experience multi-run benchmarking frameworks which use non-parametric statistics should be the default tool of choice unless you know the particular benchmark is exceptionally well behaved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213264</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how climate change is reshaping the patterns and intensity of hurricanes, employing new mathematical models to better understand these impacts. It discusses the link between rising temperatures and increased hurricane activity, noting the potential for more severe storms. The website aims to highlight the urgent need for incorporating climate science into our understanding of hurricane behavior and disaster preparedness. Through a blend of scientific analysis and data interpretation, it emphasizes the significance of adapting to these evolving weather patterns to mitigate their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Climate Central has a model that can show how much more intense hurricanes are based on how much warmer the ocean is.This is an advance for attribution science, which aims to show how much of a natural disaster is attributed to climate change.In the future I expect a party, perhaps an insurance firm, or reinsurance firm sue oil companies for their role in accelerating climate change to pay for the cost of natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the potential damages caused by a storm increase exponentially—by a power of eight—with increases in wind speedAs any CS undergraduate will be able to point out, this is not exponential, it's polynomial. Exponential means that damage ∝ a^speedA good CS undergraduate will be able to point out that this doesn't matter, as the constants involved may well be more important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almost all 2024 hurricanes went up one point on the Saffir-Simpson scale due to climate change.Wow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264586</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;Many farmers are taking on additional jobs outside of their farming activities to maintain their livelihoods as economic pressures grow. The rising costs of inputs, fluctuating prices for crops, and unpredictable weather have made it increasingly challenging for farmers to sustain their farms solely through agricultural income. This trend is being observed across various regions, reflecting a broader struggle in the agricultural sector, where many farmers find themselves juggling multiple roles to ensure financial stability and support their families. The article highlights personal stories and the impact of these additional job commitments on farmers' lives and the farming industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much of this is because of hobby farming and kids inheriting the family farm?Going back a couple hundred years, ~80% of the population was a "farmer". But by any standard, they had "multiple jobs".I.E., they were doing a lot more than just growing food to sell.You probably had a sweet spot somewhere between the 20s and 60s where you didn't yet have mega farms, but also &lt;20% of the population was a "farmer" - so you could actually make a living off that.Now, most of those farms have been sold off to mega farms or handed off to kids that don't really want to be a "farmer".With the mega farms came efficiency, and if you're trying to be an inefficient small farmer, you're going to have a bad time competing. Hence, the need for a second job.Anyone under 30 trying to compete with a mega farm is like some solo developer trying to build the next Google.It's never going to happen.Either you're doing it as a "hobby", or you REALLY want to farm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's often how it goes. The market starts out with lots of small businesses, but over time it ends up up with a few giant companies. Economists call it industry consolidation. There are some interesting nuances at the beginning and the end of the "consolidation curve" [1].[1] https://hbr.org/2002/12/the-consolidation-curve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Old joke:A farmer wins the lottery. When asked what he's going to do, he replies, "I'm going to keep farming. And when the money runs out I'll find another way to keep farming."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260983</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was skeptical of the "AI" but it has 64gb of RAM and the Ryzen AI 9 HX 37 CPU, supposedly has good LLM performance [1]. So yea, its an interesting device.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1gfr60l/ryzen_ai_300_t...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks neat, but it looks like it's trying to be everything to everyone, and while that's always tempting for a new product, I think it's usually doomed to failure.Why does it support an RS232 port, especially on such a small form factor? Why does it focus so much on local LLM support? Why has it got such a high resolution display? Why has it got swappable ports?Each one of those features makes sense in isolation for some market, but together I'm not sure there's anyone who's the target market for all of them, and because of that there are likely to be better options for each target market. Want to run an LLM? A Mac is going to do that much better with its unified memory and ML acceleration. Want to do sysadmin stuff plugged into an old switch? You probably already have an old Thinkpad for that. etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an interesting idea. GPD makes machines that will appeal to those interested in handheld gaming and those on pager duty.I own devices from GPD, and I have had two issues -- devices are simply not reliable, in just over a year the screen showed a green verticle line, and the display died a few months later. Secondly, the keyboard is simply unusable if you plan to program on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262089</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research by Sandia National Laboratories focusing on the use of smartphone signals to detect and analyze environments, particularly for monitoring structures like bridges and buildings. By leveraging the constant presence of smartphones and their signal interactions with nearby objects, the researchers aim to develop a new method for real-time, cost-effective structural health monitoring. This innovative approach has the potential to enhance safety and maintenance procedures by providing valuable data without the need for extensive, traditional monitoring equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Another problem, she said, is spoofing, which involves using a fake signal to mislead receivers into believing they are in a different location. The technique is no secret, as gaming communities use it to cheat in location-based games like Pokémon Go.&gt; “There are actual apps you can download that allow you to spoof your location, and entire subreddits dedicated to showing you how to use it for various games,” Sanderson said.Not judging the research itself, but this is kind of a dumb statement. The type of "spoofing" that you can do by just installing an app, which merely causes the OS to return fake coordinates, has virtually nothing in common with the type of "spoofing" that would threaten an aircraft by actually transmitting fake radio signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; pioneering a backup system to keep an airplane on course when it cannot rely on global positioning system satellites.So like the already existing VOR/DME network?&gt; The idea is to use these alternative signals to calculate a vehicle’s position and velocity.All commercial planes have an IMU/ADIRU in them.  Most are doubly if not triply redundant.&gt; There is no question GPS is still the gold standard for navigationNot for flight.  There are plenty of areas in Europe where it is compromised to the point of being useless.&gt; Scientists refer to it as “signals of opportunity”Way back in the day pilots would use FM radio stations in the same way.  If you were really lost out somewhere over a dark patch.&gt; If these signals are clean enough for navigation,The bigger problem you have is while these are "fixed location" services our database of the locations isn't exactly awesome or well maintained in the face of maintenance or physical changes."Signals of opportunity" for flight is a bizarre regime to even consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before commenting on this, please read "Final Report of the GPS Spoofing Group", from Ops Group.[1] This is a group for international pilots and flight planners who have to deal with GPS spoofing routinely. They are not happy about it, for multiple reasons. Newer avionics trusts GPS too much. Bad GPS data can affect other flight systems, mis-calibrate the inertial reference systems, and even change the aircraft clock.GPS spoofing confuses the Ground Collision Avoidance System, which uses GPS position and elevation maps to report nearness to the ground. The false alarm rate is now so high that such systems are useless in parts of the world.There's a lot of this spoofing going on. Look at the maps in the report.[1] https://ops.group/blog/gps-spoofing-final-report/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42238730</guid></item><item><title>48.

The major banner of WASI 0.3 is async, and adding the future and stream types to Wit. And here again, the theme is composability. It’s one thing to do async, it’s another to do composable async, where two components that are async can be composed together without either event loop having to be nested inside the other. Designing an async system flexible enough for Rust, C#, JavaScript, Go, and many others, which all have their own perspectives on async, will take some time, so while the design work is starting now, WASI 0.3 is expected to be at least a year away.WebAssembly/WASI &gt; WASI Preview 2:

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges engineers face in starting their own startups, emphasizing that technical skills alone are not sufficient for entrepreneurial success. It highlights the necessity for engineers to develop additional competencies such as business acumen, marketing, and leadership to effectively bring their innovations to market. The post calls for a broader understanding of what it takes to build a successful startup, arguing that collaboration with individuals who possess business expertise can significantly enhance the chances of success for tech-driven ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying "FBO" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.FWIW, after seeing "how the sausage is made", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.See https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/11/08/what-th...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things it took a little time to wrap my head around when I started working at Google was trading off reliability or correctness for scaling.I had previously built things like billing systems and small-scale OLTP web applications, where the concept of even asking the question of whether there could be any acceptable data loss or a nonzero error rate hadn't occurred to me. It was eye-opening to see, not so much that if you're doing millions of qps, some are going to fail, but more the difference in engineering attitude. Right this instant, there are probably thousands of people who opened their Gmail and it didn't load right or gave them a 500 error. Nobody is chasing down why that happened, because those users will just hit reload and go on with their day. Or from another perspective, if your storage has an impressive 99.99999% durability over a year, when you have two billion customers, 200 people had a really miserable day.It was a jarring transition from investigating every error in the logs to getting used to everything being a little bit broken all the time and always considering the cost before trying to do something about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reinforces for me the importance of domain knowledge in engineering leadership. i.e. if you work for a finance company you need to have a decent understanding of finance in order to make the correct technical decisions and tradeoffs, same goes for journalism, same goes for commerce etc. etc. Successful organisations I've worked for have always included domain specific, non-technical, questions to tech team interviews whilst some of the most technically acomplished teams I've worked with have floundered through a lack of domain insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42269227</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;Borgo is a programming language designed for creating and manipulating structured data, particularly for applications involving data science, machine learning, and data analysis. The website provides an introduction to the language, its features, and benefits, along with documentation, tutorials, and examples to help users understand how to write and execute Borgo code. It emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, aimed at making data handling more intuitive for developers and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love it.This is a language that everyone here says they want but no one will use, even though it's stable and mature (I assume because it compiles to stable and mature Go and can use every existing Go library).It hits all the "ok, Go is popular but made by morons for morons and if only it had this X advanced feature, it would be totally great".It has immutability. It has advanced enums. It has algebraic types. It has pattern matching. It has Result&lt;&gt; instead of returning an error. It gets rid of if err != nil. It gets read of of nil pointers.On paper it's a perfect language. It literally addresses every major complaint people have with Go.And I'll be here not using it and watching everyone else not use it.Because the harsh truth is that none of those things are actually big issues that would justify learning slightly different syntax.But maybe I'm wrong. Time will tell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is quite beautiful. It hides several ugly warts of Go without necessarily adding more complexity. Result&lt;T&gt; instead of (T, error) and ? for propagation is just so nice. Structured enums is something I find myself needing all the time (and writing less self-explanatory code due to the lack of it). Option&lt;T&gt; instead of nil and zero values (which builds upon structured enum support) is what got me to say "yes please!"Honestly, some of the things they changed are maybe unnecessary (like the additional impl syntax, the Zig influenced dereferencing, return values from statements, several other Rustisms, etc). One part of me wish Go would get all of this. But another part of me knows it would never happen because this is not a superset (Python 2 -&gt; Python 3 anyone?)I also wonder if this could even be compared to JavaScript / TypeScript for the same reason, not being a superset means you have to actively make a change to even start to migrate, and the revert path is not as trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting except for the fact that there is no license. This makes this "language" technically only usable by the creator?This is what GH says about no license being included.

For more information, see "Setting repository visibility."Also if it compiled to Rust instead of Go (it is written in Rust which made me think it compiled to Rust for a minute) we could do something about that darn GC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244791</guid></item><item><title>4.

I am aware of the benefits it offers but I think it adds a bit of mental overhead initially due to it being an additional type system you have to understand.Also why are you using pebble exactly? I was interested in seeing how you're managing your geo databases because that's usually the most mind numbing part of handling analytics if your cloud provider doesn't add that information into the request header already. However, I can't understand why you'd use pebble over something like sqlite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270389</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the progress of a copyright claim in the lawsuit against OpenAI filed by The Intercept. It details how the case involves allegations that OpenAI's use of content from The Intercept's articles may infringe on copyright laws. The piece also explores the broader implications of the lawsuit for the relationship between artificial intelligence and intellectual property rights, emphasizing the ongoing legal challenges that AI technologies face regarding content ownership and fair use.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. Two key quotes:&gt; It is unclear if the Intercept ruling will embolden other publications to consider DMCA litigation; few publications have followed in their footsteps so far. As time goes on, there is concern that new suits against OpenAI would be vulnerable to statute of limitations restrictions, particularly if news publishers want to cite the training data sets underlying ChatGPT. But the ruling is one signal that Loevy &amp; Loevy is narrowing in on a specific DMCA claim that can actually stand up in court.&gt; Like The Intercept, Raw Story and AlterNet are asking for $2,500 in damages for each instance that OpenAI allegedly removed DMCA-protected information in its training data sets. If damages are calculated based on each individual article allegedly used to train ChatGPT, it could quickly balloon to tens of thousands of violations.Tens of thousands of violations at $2500 each would amount to tens of millions of dollars in damages. I am not familiar with this field, does anyone have a sense of whether the total cost of retraining (without these alleged DMCA violations) might compare to these damages?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to figure out if OpenAI ingested my blog? If the settlements are $2500 per article then I'll take a free used cars worth of payments if its available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I understand that regulations exist and how there can be copyright violations, but shouldn't we be concerned that other.. more lenient governments (mainly China) who are opposed to the US will use this to get ahead? If OpenAI is significantly set back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273817</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and its implications in computer architecture and programming. It highlights how SIMD enables simultaneous processing of multiple data points with one instruction, thereby enhancing performance and efficiency in handling complex problems. The piece explores the challenges and intricacies that arise when implementing SIMD, particularly in dealing with trivial problems that may appear simple but can become infinitely complex in practice. It emphasizes the need for a deep understanding of both the hardware capabilities and the nature of the problems being solved to fully leverage SIMD technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel needs to see what has happened to their AVX instructions and why NVidia has taken over.If you just wrote your SIMD in CUDA 15 years ago, NVidia compilers would have given you maximum performance across all NVidia GPUs rather than being forced to write and rewrite in SSE vs AVX vs AVX512.GPU SIMD is still SIMD. Just... better at it. I think AMD and Intel GPUs can keep up btw. But software advantage and long term benefits of rewriting into CUDA are heavily apparent.Intel ISPC is a great project btw if you need high level code that targets SSE, AVX, AVX512 and even ARM NEON all with one codebase + auto compiling across all the architectures.-------Intels AVX512 is pretty good at a hardware level. But software methodology to interact with SIMD using GPU-like languages should be a priority.Intrinsics are good for maximum performance but they are too hard for mainstream programmers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; SIMD instructions are complex, and even Arm is starting to look more “CISCy” than x86!Thank you for saying it out loud. XLAT/XLATB of x86 is positively tame compared to e.g. vrgatherei16.vv/vrgather.vv.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can simplify the 2x sqrts as sqrt(a*b), overall less operations so perhaps more accurate. It would also let you get rid of the funky lane swivels.As this would only use 1 lane, perhaps if you have multiple of these to normalize, you could vectorize it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237938</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the philosophy of John Dewey, an influential American thinker whose ideas emphasized the importance of practical action and democratic engagement in education and society. It highlights Dewey's belief in experiential learning, advocating for an educational system that fosters critical thinking and problem-solving through real-world experiences. Dewey stressed the need for individuals to actively participate in the democratic process, ensuring that ideas are rooted in actionable practice rather than mere theories. Ultimately, the article underscores Dewey's legacy in shaping modern education and civic life by promoting a hands-on, interactive approach to learning and community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of pipes getting stuck while buffering in software systems, explaining the underlying reasons this occurs. It details how buffering works and the impact of various factors such as network latency and resource availability on the performance of data pipelines. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these mechanics to improve system efficiency and reliability, and provides insights into potential solutions to mitigate buffering issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275033"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The solution is that buffered accesses should almost always flush after a threshold number of bytes or after a period of time if there is at least one byte, “threshold or timeout”. This is pretty common in hardware interfaces to solve similar problems.In this case, the library that buffers in userspace should set appropriate timers when it first buffers the data. Good choices of timeout parameter are: passed in as argument, slightly below human-scale (e.g. 1-100 ms), proportional to {bandwidth / threshold} (i.e. some multiple of the time it would take to reach the threshold at a certain access rate), proportional to target flushing overhead (e.g. spend no more than 0.1% time in syscalls).Also note this applies for both writes and reads. If you do batched/coalesced reads then you likely want to do something similar. Though this is usually more dependent on your data channel as you need some way to query or be notified of “pending data” efficiently which your channel may not have if it was not designed for this use case. Again, pretty common in hardware to do interrupt coalescing and the like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Some things I didn’t talk about in this post since these posts have been getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000 words about buffering?I personally would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those things where, despite some 20+ years of dealing with NIX systems, I know* it happens, but always forget about it until I've sat puzzled why I've got no output for several moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275033</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scary part is not the GPS installed by the fleet company that previously owned the car, which in all likelihood was just forgotten there, but the GPS and eSIM that comes with most (all?) new cars and that in most (all?) new cars cannot be disabled.Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with "driver impairment" tech which was called a "kill switch". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just "sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements" and "block the driver from operating the vehicle". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497Anyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I'll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love hardware mysteries.I mostly drive old 90s enthusiast cars, and I have had my fair share of undocumented switches.The most surprising to date was in a Nissan Silvia, from 1989. Sometimes it wouldn't crank off the key, given the solution chosen it must have been a wiring issue. Instead of fixing that wiring, the previous owner had directly wired power to the starter via a "missle switch" style switch, and instead of mounting it anywhere remotely useful, it was just spliced into the loom and sat on top of the rocker cover in the engine bay.So if it wouldn't start, I had to leave the key at "on", hop out of the car, bump that switch and then it would start. Obviously standing in front of a manual car while starting it is the dumbest thing next to wiring your starter to a switch in the engine bay. Fortunately I never ran myself over.Another one, I will keep short, a 97 Skyline would only light up ready to start 1/4 times. Seemingly randomly, on key bump. Turns out the flash memory for the fuel map had corrupted, and depending on the temperature and a bit of randomness from the sensors, it would only hit a corrupted cell occasionally. It got worse and worse as more of the table corrupted, until it would only start say 1/60 key bumps.It was a dodgy power wire causing the corruption, and fixing that plus reflashing the tune fixed the issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure there is no little man in a back room somewhere tracking his every move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42276620</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat to see more folks writing blogs on their experiences. This however does seem like it's an over-complicated method of building llama.cpp.Assuming you want to do this iteratively (at least for the first time) should only need to run:  ccmake .

And toggle the parameters your hardware supports or that you want (e.g. if CUDA if you're using Nvidia, Metal if you're using Apple etc..), and press 'c' (configure) then 'g' (generate), then:  cmake --build . -j $(expr $(nproc) / 2)


Done.If you want to move the binaries into your PATH, you could then optionally run cmake install.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First time I heard about Llama.cpp I got it to run on my computer. Now, my computer: a Dell laptop from 2013 with 8Gb RAM and an i5 processor, no dedicated graphic card. Since I wasn't using a MGLRU enabled kernel, It took a looong time to start but wasn't OOM-killed. Considering my amount of RAM was just the minimum required, I tried one of the smallest available models.Impressively, it worked. It was slow to spit out tokens, at a rate around a word each 1 to 5 seconds and it was able to correctly answer "What was the biggest planet in the solar system", but it quickly hallucinated talking about moons that it called "Jupterians", while I expected it to talk about Galilean Moons.Nevertheless, LLM's really impressed me and as soon as I get my hands on better hardware I'll try to run other bigger models locally in the hope that I'll finally have a personal "oracle" able to quickly answers most questions I throw at it and help me writing code and other fun things. Of course, I'll have to check its answers before using them, but current state seems impressive enough for me, specially QwQ.Is Any one running smaller experiments and can talk about your results? Is it already possible to have something like an open source co-pilot running locally?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Llama.cpp is one of those projects that I want to install, but I always just wind up installing kobold.cpp because it's simply miles better with UX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274489</guid></item><item><title>12.

We are basically at the point where computers are better at them then humans.https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot14/woot14... is a paper on the subject i think is really interestingHowever a surprising amount of text based captchas can be solved in a few line shell script of, using imagemagik to convert to greyscale, dilate and undilate, then pass to teserractHowever there are also sites like https://2captcha.net , so really captchas are more like putting a small min amount of effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part about bad Keras&lt;-&gt;Tensorflow.js interop is classic Tensorflow.

&lt;p&gt;A grave belonging to a German WWII soldier has been discovered in Poland, alongside an array of intriguing artifacts, including Mesolithic tools, Roman coins, and Byzantine currency. The grave's contents suggest the soldier may have been part of a larger community or involved in trade, highlighting a rich historical context. The findings underline the intersection of different cultures and time periods in the area, sparking interest in both archaeological and historical research related to WWII and earlier civilizations in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it's not uncommon to find many eras of artifacts in the same site, simply because sites ranging back even to the neolithic continue to be used as time goes on. My layman assumption is that this was a decent sized community for a number of centuries that eventually died out, which this German solider happened to die on top of during the war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190984</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of the "open-source software (OSS)" label by the Linux kernel's maintainers to improve transparency about the licensing and usage of software components within the kernel. It highlights the growing complexity of managing open-source licenses and aims to provide clearer communication regarding the software's compliance and dependencies. The initiative encourages developers to label their contributions, thereby enhancing the kernel's overall integrity and streamlining the process for users and contributors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe struct sockaddr was supposed to serve the role for which sockaddr_storage was later invented. That's why it has the padding array sa_data: so that if you actually define or allocate such an object it will be big enough to hold any address. In no way is that a flexible array, and you never want to be accessing it.Probably, sockaddr_storage was introduced rather than making sockaddr's array bigger because by that time the definition of sockaddr had become a mystical sacred cow, not to be touched. Plus that size of 14 is the same on every system. It is a one size fits all approach which is not a way to define the maximum size structure over all the address types if you want every platform to be able to make it a tight fit. The size is going to vary with implementation due to different alignment and padding requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It wouldn’t help the kernel case here, but I’ve long thought that the socket TCP and UDP APIs were bad in the general use case.  Having to build and shuffle around the sockaddr structure is too low level for the majority use case.  I think most programmers would prefer something like:    int inet_connect(AF_TYPE, destination, port, options, &amp;error);

Also:    int inet_listen(AF_TYPE, port, options, &amp;error);

So for example:    int sock;
    inet_err err = NULL;
    sock = inet_connect(SOCK_STREAM, “google.com”, 443, NULL, &amp;err);
    if ( sock &lt; 0 )
    {
        printf(“Failed to connect: %s\n”, err-&gt;message);
        return -1;
    }

Basically one level more abstraction in the API.  The old API could stick around for people who are doing something weird, but this would cover most use cases I think.  Added bonus: programs using this API are trivial to add support for IPv6, it is just a recompile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Needless to say, these casts can be error prone; casting a pointer between different structure types is also deemed to be undefined behavior in current C.This surprised me. What kind of mechanism is there in place to prevent the compiler from formatting /dev/sda when you write code like this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270424</guid></item><item><title>15.

The requirement first for a shared physical space, in the age of remote working. Secondly the need for programs to fit on a table, which his simple examples even seem to barely do. In a meeting you'd have to be constantly arranging things on the table, putting things away as you move on to the next example, remembering how to arrange the next deck etc.. personally if I do a presentation, I want all the slides on the cloud in case of any issues, not to be carrying round a set of cards in a binder..I would think the more likely next step in combatting complexity, would be personalised AIs. These would understand the context of the presentation being given, and therefore can provide us remote audience members with explanations and visualisations on demand, that would suit our level of understanding of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the title saying "summary" and the date, this is a complete (and new) video&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239344</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository for "cwp" (Contextual Web Pages) presents a project that focuses on creating interactive and context-aware web pages. The repository includes source code, documentation, and examples demonstrating how to integrate contextual information into web applications, enhancing user experience by providing relevant content based on users' interactions and preferences. It is an open-source initiative aimed at developers looking to implement advanced web functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What the author did is cool in a social sense; lispers go on and on about homoiconicity, which here means that the original lisp code is data. The author uses this property by reading this code/data and transforming it into text, that represents syntax-full code. It is "cool" because it demonstrates the value of homoiconicity.However; it's not cool in a technical sense. The result is not homoiconic any more. Code that had a cool property has been turned into code that does not, and the result looks like every other syntax-full blub language. The result destroys value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting project, showing how "easy" it is to host[1] another language within Clojure. Like others, I admit I see little value for myself or as a selling point for beginners. For experienced engineers however, like I wrote above it should serve as a case study into how to hook up everything together to produce a working tool. Then it is a matter of seeing if and when there is opportunity to reuse such techniques to build DSLs that compile to native Clojure.[1] Clojure is known to being designed to be hosted within another platform, but like all Lisps it is also a valid (and productive) hosting target by itself. It should be known that many of the APIs in the Clojure ecosystem rely either on:- literal data structures
- macros reusing native Clojure patterns / forms such as `let`, `def` ...
- the shape of native (ie: defined within clojure.core) Clojure APIs, such as `get-in`, `with`...Some examples: specter, integrant, mount, clojure.core.logic, datalog (datascript, datomic, xtdb), clojure.spec ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really cool, I like it a lot! I don't think the parens in lisp are actually the problem, I think it's the embedding. I.e. List programps naturally tend to get very nested very fast, kinda like this:(-  (+ (* 3 4)

     (- 3 1))

  3)

It's just a simple sum, but reading it involves a lot of remembering contexts and how things should work in lisp. The CWP examples uses arrow/pipeline style macros a bunch, which are awesome! I kinda feel like they already solve the issues that a lot of people have with parens:(-&gt;&gt; 3     (* 4)

     (+ (- 3 1)

     (- 3))


There's still a tonne of parens there, but the flow is a lot more readable for me.Edit: sorry for the very difficult to read code formatting - couldn't figure out how to monospace things in hackernews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42234323</guid></item><item><title>17.

The neuron itself can be thought of as a meta-topology in that it constructs potentially arbitrary hypergraphs with the basic building block of axon/dendrites, albeit with a locality bias.Neurons actually have different topologies across different brain regions, such as the more striated hippocampus versus the stratified cerebral lobes. These have been hypothesized to function as different forms of gradient descent, as pure back propagation style bidirectional communication is perhaps only present in a few specific brain regions or body extremities. But I think a more popular interpretation is that these are neighborhoods of co-activation that emphasize different kinds of distributed learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related to something similar Richard Feynman worked on - called Connection Machine: https://tamikothiel.com/theory/cm_txts/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235718</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for prioritizing tasks at the task level in order to improve power efficiency in macOS applications. It emphasizes the importance of managing application workload effectively by scheduling intensive computations during periods of lower power demand and minimizing resource consumption during peak usage times. The guidelines suggest utilizing background execution, optimizing task execution order, and being mindful of energy impact when designing applications, ultimately aiming for a balance between performance and power usage to enhance the overall user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A number of years ago, I was working on the port of Bazel to macOS. One of the issues we faced internally at Google was that some of our users reported that Bazel builds randomly killed their Internet connection and that they performed poorly.There was a lot of FUD around the topic, with some engineers blanket-claiming that "well, macOS is bad at threads, so there's that". I didn't buy that explanation because I had seen macOS under serious load in other occasions and none of this nonsense happened in them.And then, almost by chance, I stumbled upon this QoS system, did a few spot-checks, and found that the VPN daemon was misconfigured to run at a low class. Consequently, Bazel starved the VPN for those users and made everything misbehave. Adjusting that one parameter fixed everything.If you are curious, I ended up writing some more on this here: https://jmmv.dev/2019/03/macos-threads-qos-and-bazel.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was a life hack recommendations article but it’s about Quality of Service.@dang or @op can we get QoS added to the title?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional reading about how Swift Structured Concurrency (Task API) utilizes and propagates QoS is in the proposal doc.https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/propo...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244482</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the intuitions behind Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. It explains how SAEs promote sparsity in the hidden layer activations, leading to the learning of efficient representations of input data. The content elaborates on the mechanisms that induce sparsity, including the use of regularization techniques, and illustrates the benefits and applications of SAEs in various machine learning tasks. The piece aims to provide a deeper understanding of how SAEs function and their significance within the broader context of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent updates to the Spotify Web API, highlighting changes that enhance functionality and developer experience. Key improvements include new endpoints and enhanced data access for developers, as well as deprecated features that will no longer be supported. The aim is to streamline API usage and encourage innovation within the Spotify ecosystem, while also providing guidance on how to adapt to these changes effectively. Additionally, the team encourages feedback and collaboration to further refine and enhance the API offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently just started using psst which is a Spotify GUI that's much lighter. When you right click a song and go to show similar tracks u get an array of sliders corresponding to the audio analysis/features like valence, danceability, energy, etc to tweak the recommendations.It made a light and day difference for music discoverability for me, while the default spotify radio keeps giving me songs i skip instantly multiple times along with songs I've listened to a hundred times, doing this through the API, is 100x better. I've discovered 30 new songs that I love this past week while that number has been steadily dwindling for the past 6 months using Spotify.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;APIs that don't put money on the table are being phased out. Musk did it with twitter and it didn't die (I'm not debating quality/financials). Then reddit did it (and even blocked VPNs) and it didn't die. Sure, it might've lost some quality, but the stock is up 200% since March.So as long as they're winning, every corp is going to either shut down APIs or absurdly gouge prices. This is the new internet that we've voted for with money and attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While we're thinking of alternatives to Spotify, for years I've been buying albums straight from Bandcamp whenever possible, and HDTracks/etc for artists not on that platform. Then toss up the FLAC/MP3's on my Jellyfin server. I'm pretty sure artists get a lot more of your money that way, and you're not locked into yet another streaming platform that doesn't let you own the actual music files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260481</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a new statistical approach for evaluating machine learning models, introduced by Anthropic. It emphasizes the importance of reliable evaluation methods to ensure that AI systems operate safely and effectively. The proposed methodology focuses on analyzing model performance through a statistical framework that accounts for the uncertainties and variabilities inherent in AI data. By applying this approach, researchers can more accurately assess the capabilities and limitations of AI models, leading to improved decision-making and trust in AI deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

But I also suspect most AI people out there now a days have limited math skills so maybe it’s helpful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All things considered, although I'm in favor of Anthropic's suggestions, I'm surprised that they're not recommending more (nominally) advanced statistical methods. I wonder if this is because more advanced methods don't have any benefits or if they don't want to overwhelm the ML community.For one, they could consider using equivalence testing for comparing models, instead of significance testing. I'd be surprised if their significance tests were not significant given 10000 eval questions and I don't see why they couldn't ask the competing models 10000 eval questions?My intuition is that multilevel modelling could help with the clustered standard errors, but I'll assume that they know what they're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since when the heck did evals change what they referred to. Evals were what you did to check if the output of a model was correct. What happened ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220573</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the successful meltdown test of China's pebble-bed reactor, which is a significant advancement in nuclear reactor technology. This type of reactor, known for its safety and efficiency, uses spherical fuel elements that can withstand high temperatures without melting. The test demonstrated the reactor's ability to maintain safety in extreme conditions, marking a notable milestone in the development of nuclear energy in China and potentially influencing global reactor designs. The article highlights the implications for nuclear safety and the future of energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pebble bed reactors are a bad idea in general.They will be HUMONGOUS because they need a large surface to radiate away the heat for the passive safety, so they can't be easily put into a containment building.A core of a PWR plant is _tiny_ for the amount of power it produces (around 3GWt!), just around 5 meters in diameter and 15 meters in height.The pebble bed reactor in the article (HTR-PM) is around the same size, but it produces a mere 0.25 GWt.Pebbles themselves are also problematic, they tend to swell, crack, and they can't be reprocessed using the current technologies. They MASSIVELY increase the amount of waste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20+ years later - https://www.wired.com/2004/09/china-5/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Other pebble beds: The pebble bed technology and design has previously been used in prototype reactors in China and Germany, but not a larger-scale plant like Shidaowan.That's wrong, Hamm-Uentrop was a full scale commercial reactor. It did run in total for a week or so between 1985 and 1989 and was then shut down. The fundamental problem is, that the pebbles grind against each other, and being of the same material as pebbles they can grind each other down. (Now if you wonder why this wasn't discovered at the experimental reactor in Juellich, those guys just never mentioned that they lost fuel.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275834</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A friend and I were talking about the weight of EVs and we assumed my EV would be heavier than his car, a BMW 3. The BMW was heavier. Maybe the average EV is heaver than the average ICE, but if you compare what the EV has replaced for that owner, it might be that the EVs aren't noticeably heavier. I just checked the car I had before the Leaf - a Subaru Outback. It was also heavier.I don't think that taxing vehicles based on weight is the right option though. If the pollution is from tires, then tax tires. Do this based on the compounds present in that tire. If someone drives rashly, doing donuts all over the place, then they as a greater polluter will need to pay more. I don't really know anything about Formula 1, but get them to do the race on a single set of tires. Not for pollution, but for solutions that might make it into regular tires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of an old article I read about this from `Straight Dope` years ago (2006 in fact!)[0].&gt; Pollution studies in the Los Angeles basin in the 1980s concluded that more than five tons of breathable tire dust were released into the atmosphere there each day, and there’s no reason to think that figure’s gone down since.[0] https://www.straightdope.com/21343778/when-the-rubber-meets-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to start making manufacturers pay for their negative externalities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42269925</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You see this happening in russia these days.My favourite was from the start of the war when the guys who were supposed to plant incriminating evidence on the scene were they arrested some "terrorists" put the Sims 3 game on the scene instead of 3 sim cards and literally signed the fake documents they planted with "Signature Unclear". (Yes, real story, just search for Sims 3 and Signature Unclear.)As I understand it I understand this was FSB (or someone elses) way of "getting even" after their boss had been publicly humiliated for proposing to not invade Ukraine. (But that - except for the public humiliation which is well documented - is just speculation on my part although I might have heard it from someone else thinking loud.)Although sometimes I wonder if it was a genuine misunderstanding. I feel I have unusually many Russian friends and ex-colleagues, people who live outside of russia for good reasons and do not support it. Z-russians on the other hand does not strike me as the brightest bulbs in the box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Log users out frequently for "security reasons".This is exactly what happens on a contract I work on. Any software that is authenticated through our OKTA SSO very frequently signs users out and redirects to a logout page. This is especially annoying when using the project management software, where you typically have many tabs open to see various requirements, epics, stories, tasks, etc. Any inactivity more than 15 minutes, and all the tabs are logged out. Just like that, everything is gone. It forces us to use strategies such as saving redundant copies of things in notes and spreadsheets. I don’t think it’s necessarily sabotage but it feels extremely negligent. Moreover it’s completely unnecessary since everything is behind a VPN anyway.Another similar thing that does feel as if it’s somewhat malicious is the very aggressive logout and shutdown policy of our virtual desktops - these are the desktops we do everyday active development on and where we set up IDEs, database clients, web servers, testing tools, API references - anything you can think of. We use this in combination with our regular desktops where we attend meetings or do other non-development tasks such as using the above-mentioned requirements software. It takes a lot of time to set all of this up! If you’re inactive for more than 2 hours, your session is not only closed, it’s completely destroyed so that it can be reclaimed for another user. I don’t need to explain to experienced developers how incredibly frustrating and counterproductive this is, but leadership has been extremely dismissive of any complaints, and tell us that we should use our time more wisely or that we shouldn’t be inactive for so long (which is complete BS, there are a thousand valid reasons foe this). Apparently this is done for cost-cutting reasons, but something feels more nefarious here, because this very obviously leads to reduced productivity and demotivation. This has actually lead to me purposefully overestimating complexity and demanding a user story for every single little trivial action I take, whereas before I used to just go in and make quick fixes or knock out certain operational things in my spare time. It’s a waste of time for us and ends up being worse for our customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a takeoff on a well known WWII pamphlet, the Simple Sabotage Field Manual.[1]That's not the real worry today. Today we have to worry about remote sabotage of key systems - water, power, comms. It's quite possible that we will see major blackouts in the US, Russia, Europe, or China as side effects of the various wars in progress.[1] https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/the-art-of-simple-sabotage...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275919</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article on Construction Physics details the development of the lithium-ion battery, outlining its historical evolution and the key scientific breakthroughs that led to its invention. It highlights the contributions of various scientists and researchers, including significant advancements in materials and chemistry that allowed for improved energy density and charging capabilities. The text emphasizes the impact of these innovations on modern technology, particularly in portable electronics and electric vehicles, while also discussing the ongoing research aimed at enhancing battery performance and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Exxon was concerned that oil supply might peak in the next few decades, and was funding research on a wide variety of alternative energy technologies that might replace it.But later in the 21st century, transnational petroleum interests simply decided to change the leadership of any government that attempted to pass radical legislation that might reduce pollution and dependence on petroleum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article leaves out a lot of history of the lithium-ion batteries -- there were tons of companies using them in the late 80s and early 90s.I ported software for testing them under various temperatures for use in down-hole horizontal drilling equipment in the late 80s.  When looking up my old company when writing this post, I ran across the following list of hundreds of companies getting permission to transport them (hazardous back then too!) in 1991 from the DOT, and a 1973 technical report from the US Army on appropriate lithium ion battery testing procedures, which seems earlier than much of the research discussed in this article:

It depends on time, cost and difficulty, with breakthroughs in both domains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273966</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents benchmarks of various asynchronous runtimes in 2024, comparing their performance across several criteria such as throughput, latency, and resource usage. It aims to provide insights for developers in choosing the most suitable asynchronous framework for their needs by presenting detailed results from a series of tests and analyses. The benchmarks are organized to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each runtime, facilitating informed decision-making in the development of asynchronous applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270378"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel this benchmark compares apples to oranges in some cases.For example, for node, the author puts a million promises into the runtime event loop and uses `Promise.all` to wait for them all.This is very different from, say, the Go version where the author creates a million goroutines and puts `waitgroup.Done` as a defer call.While this might be the idiomatic way of concurrency in the respective languages, it does not account for how goroutines are fundamentally different from promises, and how the runtime does things differently. For JS, there's a single event loop. Counting the JS execution threads, the event loop thread and whatever else the runtime uses for async I/O, the execution model is fundamentally different from Go. Go (if not using `GOMAXPROCS`) spawns an OS thread for every physical thread that your machine has, and then uses a userspace scheduler to distribute goroutines to those threads. It may spawn more OS threads to account for OS threads sleeping on syscalls. Although I don't think the runtime will spawn extra threads in this case.It also depends on what the "concurrent tasks" (I know, concurrency != parallelism) are. Tasks such as reading a file or doing a network call are better done with something like promises, but CPU-bound tasks are better done with goroutines or Node worker_threads. It would be interesting to see how the memory usage changes when doing async I/O vs CPU-bound tasks concurrently in different languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a difference between "running a task that waits for 10 seconds" and "scheduling a wakeup in 10 seconds".The code for several of the languages that are low-memory usage that do the second while the high memory usage results do the first. For example, on my machine the article's go code uses 2.5GB of memory but the following code uses only 124MB. That difference is in-line with the rust results.  package main
  
  import (
    "os"
    "strconv"
    "sync"
    "time"
  )
  
  func main() {
    numRoutines, _ := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i &lt; numRoutines; i++ {
      wg.Add(1)
      time.AfterFunc(10*time.Second, wg.Done)
    }
    wg.Wait()
  }&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know what's a fair way to do this for all languages listed in the benchmark, but for Go vs Node the only fair way would be to use a single goroutine to schedule timers and another one to pick them up when they tick, this way we don't create a huge stack and it's much more comparable to what you're really doing in Node.Consider the following code:package mainimport (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strconv"
    "time"
)func main() {    numTimers, _ := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])

    timerChan := make(chan struct{})

    // Goroutine 1: Schedule timers
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i &lt; numTimers; i++ {
            timer := time.NewTimer(10 * time.Second)
            go func(t *time.Timer) {
                &lt;-t.C
                timerChan &lt;- struct{}{}
            }(timer)
        }
    }()

    // Goroutine 2: Receive and process timer signals
    for i := 0; i &lt; numTimers; i++ {
        &lt;-timerChan
    }
}Also for Node it's weird not to have Bun and Deno included. I suppose you can have other runtimes for other languages too.In the end I think this benchmark is comparing different things and not really useful for anything...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270378</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations on the achievement!Ever since I got into Clojure I have wanted what you are building. I love the language, I love the collections, but I don't love waiting for program startup.I can't wait until Jank is complete!In fact, how can we help at the moment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clojure is a quirky language, and I really enjoyed writing a proof-of-concept microservice with it back in 2015-era when everyone was shouting "Scala is the way!" I was able to prototype with it and stand it up in a weekend. With the tiniest bit of code, I had the exact service I needed. It ended up in production after only spending a couple weeks, most of which was spent wrapping my head around Docker and Mesos that we used to run the .jar.However, it's a quirky language. So, my quick take, as a glue layer on top of the JVM, it was quite powerful, but jank has me scratching my head. LISP doesn't really read well the bigger the codebase, and as something to write software in standalone environment, it makes me a bit hesitant.I sometimes would hit walls, because in real world software, you need persistent state. Functional software, for obvious reasons, fights against that, and so modeling state is actually quite difficult. This is where I think, as a small layer on top, it's fast and effective. I would just not want to write more than a few files with it though. Happy to follow along this project though and see where it goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi Jeaye, love what you and the other contributors are doing with jank. The further proliferation of clojure dialects can't happen quickly enough imo.Do you have any "killer app" style use cases in mind for jank? Babashka is great in CLI/FaaS settings, native Clojure is great for "situated" programs that can afford a JVM startup and some memory overheadWhich settings are you particularly excited to use jank in?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42276672</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; GIMP 3.0 supports palettes outside of the "Standard Red Green Blue" (sRGB) range, such as "Cyan Magenta Yellow Key" (CMYK) and (CIELAB). This expanded color support, especially for CMYK, is essential to those who work with print and desktop publishing. However, GIMP continues to use sRGB, grayscale, and indexed colors for storing color information internally for now. Conversion to other color spaces is done on output, where necessary.The wording here is confusing, because it makes it sound like CMYK/CIELAB will only be applied at the very end of the image transformation pipeline. That would really limit the usefulness of adding these extra color spaces, since doing the manipulation in a different color space than RGB is often the point.But the linked blog post on GIMP.org[0] words it a little differently:&gt; What it means for color correctness in particular is that we will now do color conversion only when needed (last-second conversion) and therefore won’t lose information when it could have been avoided. For instance, say you color-pick color from an image: if we were to convert to an intermediate format, before using it on a second image (which may or may not be in another color format), we’d do 2 conversions. Which means more possibility of precision loss. The issue is even more flagrant if the input and output formats are the same (i.e. no conversion should happen at all). And this will be even more a problem when we will have core CMYK backend (we really want to avoid doing a round-trip to an intermediate format with CMYK, which doesn’t have bijective conversion with most other color models, even when working unbounded and ignoring precision issues).That sounds more like the information of the original color space will be kept as well, and transformations will be applied only when necessary, to avoid lossy roundtrips. Which is not quite the same.[0] https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/02/21/gimp-2-99-18-released/#...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally updated UI! I really hope it inspires more updates and brings in even more people, just like when Blender revamped their UX a few years back and saw an amazing boost in popularity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really looking forward to see more non-destructive editing. For me this has been one of the major reasons not to use GIMP in the past. The integration of GEGL is a huge milestone for GIMP imho.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42272927</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Don't F*** With Scroll" addresses the negative impact of infinite scrolling on user engagement and mental health, advocating for users and developers to reconsider how content is presented online. It highlights the addictive nature of infinite scroll features, which can lead to decreased attention spans and increased feelings of overwhelm. The site encourages a shift towards more mindful design practices that prioritize user well-being over relentless engagement metrics. Overall, it serves as a call to action for more responsible content consumption and website design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is moving to implement age verification measures for social media platforms with the aim of safeguarding children from online harm. The proposed regulations would require social media companies to verify users' ages to prevent underage access to their platforms. This initiative is part of a broader effort by the Australian government to enhance child safety online, addressing concerns about the risks posed by social media exposure, including harmful content and interactions. The move has generated discussions about balancing child protection with privacy and freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an Australian parent this is really pleasing to see. It's clearly inspired heavily by the work of Jon Haidt and Jean Twenge et al. The kids are not okay and the main thing stopping a worried parent from addressing it is that "all the other kids are on it". If you have an addicted/bullied child would you make them a social pariah and create interminable arguments by taking away their devices? Collective action is needed and this is what it looks like.We don't need watertight compliance, verification or enforcement - just raise the level of difficulty for kids to get on and create a culture among kids, parents and schools that social media is not allowed. This will be enough breathing room for parents to say no and kids not to feel like they're the only ones missing out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I appreciate the sentiment of this legislation, removing social media access for everyone under 16 years to address the concerns of a few is a nanny state act. As a parent, you should be making these decisions for your children - not your government. Additionally, I would suggest it won't address the actual issue. The named/identified social media companies will comply as required, younger internet users will simply go elsewhere (the internet is a big place after all) and therefore the problem will ultimately go unaddressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The votes are strong majorities of both houses - great to see a functional democratic government act on such an important issue.They specifically don’t prescribe any particular age verification methods. This would be a great time to follow up with legislation that updates their national IDs to be able to provide cryptographically secure proofs of age without leaking identity.Absent that, I’m sure many of the comments to come will worry about the privacy implications. It really would be great to see the government act with expertise to solve the problem in a way compatible with a free and open society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270966</guid></item><item><title>38.

I wouldn't trust them to know what they're talking about ... or that their solution of "selling off two of its tools" helps the situation. What competitors are waiting in the wings that aren't also going to employ the same practices?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These worldwide anti-competitive lawsuit and penalty news are getting far too frequent that it makes me wonder if any of it is working at all. Meanwhile, there are some talks about some big impactful interventions. But again, they have remained just that - talks.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Friday is one of those imported things we could do without. Did you know shops in the Netherlands are now massively participating in Black Friday? We didn't even have this 'event' ten years ago.Because of our Sinterklaas gift giving event on 5 December people would have been out shopping for presents in any case (like Xmas presents, just earlier and with the OG Santa instead of the Coca Cola dude), so in terms of footfall it doesn't change much, but it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up I guess.Refreshingly, one national household items chain (Dille &amp; Kamille) closed its store in my town today, with a notice stating the staff was out picking up litter around the city centre instead of submitting to the consumerist Black Friday phenomenon. Interesting, but on-profile for their brand. Good deeds are a marketing opportunity too of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually found Black Friday to help me be less focused on consumerism during the rest of the year. When I want to buy something, I typically jot it down on my "thoughts for BF" list. Then, when everyone is having sales, I can dedicate time and through the yearly purchases. Also helps prevent impulse purchases as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people find it such a challenge to not excessively consume they have to dedicate a special day for when they manage to not buy something for 24 hours - we’re so cooked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275745</guid></item><item><title>41.

Not sure why you wouldn't just convert your Markdown to LaTeX if you're not writing source code yourself anyhow. There's even a package that allows you to parse Markdown as part of your LaTeX build, which works really well in combination with Overleaf if you want this workflow available from anywhere with next to no preliminary setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An alternative stack that circumvents LaTeX and that I've successfully used for a book-scale project would be pandoc+weasyprint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42271078</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;BYD has introduced a new sodium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) aimed at grid-scale applications. This innovation marks a significant development in energy storage technology, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on traditional lithium-ion batteries. The sodium-ion BESS is designed to enhance energy efficiency and provide reliable power supply, addressing the growing demand for clean energy solutions. BYD's commitment to advancing battery technology is part of their broader strategy to support the transition towards renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

If longevity and number of cycles is much higher than lithium ion coupled with a safer profile then I think this would be an ideal application for sodium ion. Really cool.Edit: I'm talking about for both onboard batteries (for the safety profile) and the BESS container mentioned in the video. Not to mention trains wouldn't have to compete with the lithium ion battery supply that is taken over by EV cars and trucks.[1] https://youtu.be/sARTvQj5jIg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article says BYD sells Sodium-Ion cars too. Are those cars super low range with quicker charging times? If they are much cheaper batteries it makes sense for an urban setting to have such cars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that our tariff situation in the coming years doesn't leave us behind the coming tech curve.Our entire energy future in the US could be held back severely if we are kept from adopting the best technology by politicians trying to prop up oil. The market must be allowed to choose the most efficient technology on its own. (And even the oil companies know that their future is limited, the only question is how long they can delay that future and how much money they can extract from consumers through higher prices than the alternatives.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270610</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "last mile" challenges in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) implementation. It highlights the difficulties organizations face in fully integrating AI solutions into their existing processes and workflows. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing these challenges to maximize the benefits of AI technologies, focusing on practical strategies for overcoming barriers and ensuring successful adoption. Through a blend of anecdotal evidence and analysis, the piece aims to illuminate the critical steps necessary for bridging the gap between AI capabilities and real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This really only presents the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI) will significantly impact the final stages of various processes, often referred to as the "last mile." However, she does not provide substantial evidence or detailed arguments to support this claim. The article lacks specific examples, data, or references that would substantiate her position, making it more of an opinion piece than a thoroughly backed analysis.Don't get me to be wrong I would love this to be true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Context is a challenge for LLMs, but the challenge feels of a different quality to me, than the challenge of incorporating local context into automated decision-making AI like algorithmic hiring, banking decisions, and real estate valuation like Zillow. These examples are more like "pre-LLM" machine learning, and it's not clear to me that LLMs are inherently limited in the same way. If anything, I think there's potential for LLMs to more flexibly handle a much broader variety of local contextual information by ingesting natural language rather than non-LLM machine learning systems where how to featurize or represent this information is typically quite bespoke. Take the neighbors' practicing death metal in their garage every Sunday and its impact on house valuation - it feels harder to get a non-LLM ML system to "understand" this, as a very sparse "feature", than an LLM.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was thinking about this today in context of hiring.We have these amazing LLMs that are continually improving. Yet if you say to them, here’s my business, now takeover the marketing department. You will end up with so much output that’s not localized that the value of the whole output is worth very little. Yet when you have a highly experienced localized marketing leader use the LLM to speed up work the whole output is very valuable.I don’t think this problem is solved by solely defining preferences better. It’s clear a human adaptation layer beyond solely RLHF is needed for at least the short term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213391</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of microbenchmarks in programming and software performance evaluation. It highlights how these experiments, when designed and executed correctly, can provide valuable insights into the efficiency of algorithms and code. The author emphasizes potential pitfalls in microbenchmarking, including environmental factors and incorrect measurement techniques, suggesting best practices for conducting accurate and reliable tests. By understanding these factors, developers can improve their code's performance and make informed decisions based on the results of microbenchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s cool to see this kind of analysis, even if it’s analyzing a totally bogus benchmark.If you want to compare language runtimes, compilers, or CPUs then you have to pick a larger workload than just one loop. So, if a microbenchmark is an experiment, then it is a truly bad experiment indeed.Reason: loops like this are easy for compilers to analyze, in a way that makes them not representative of real code. The hard part of writing a good compiler is handling the hard to analyze cases, not loops like this. So, if a runtime does well on a bullshit loop like this then it doesn’t mean that it’ll do well on real stuff.(Source: I wrote a bunch of the JSC optimizations including the loop reshaping and the modulo ones mentioned by this post.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cannot stop being surprised how fast Java is in mocrobenchmarks compare to may experience with real world Java applications. Probably Java's problem is not JVM but the culture - a typical Java application probably has many times more code than a C/C++ application doing something similar. This code would come mostly form of libraries (frameworks) but many layers deep onion architecture in the application itself is also a common case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I take away a different lesson: Dart is most likely slow out of the box. The author lists several reasons: int vs. Int64, GC interrupts, load hoist optimization. All of these are issues with Dart. Hence microbenchmarks, even without interpretation or validation, point to issues with the language implementation. They are not "meaningless".It is true, one microbenchmark only shows that said microbenchmark is slow, not that the language as a whole is slow, but the plural of anecdotes is data. If you systematically evaluate a representative set of microbenchmarks (as in the Computer Language Shootout), then it is proof that the language is slow or fast.Now of course one can argue about what is "representative", but taking random samples of code from across GitHub seems like a reasonable approach. And of course there is the issue of 1-1 translation but at this point LLM's can do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270348</guid></item><item><title>46.

Maybe I'm a bit lost because I'm not a dev. I'm a designer considering selfhosted Google Analytics alternatives and this one may be interesting to add to the research (so far I have Matomo, plausible, open panel, umami, open replay, highlight).

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not bad, an article aiming to popularize product and sum types. I am not the target audience, but wished there was a way to get the masses to understand that elementary type theory and logic are at the heart of these programming concepts that remain the same across languages.Back when I worked on translation of pattern matching in the Scala compiler (pre Kotlin, pre "Java 5" with generics..) I surely hoped but could not imagine that the world would turn out like this, with python, Java, Rust all supporting matching and sum types.I don't see many texts that bridge type theory (mathematical logic) and data modeling, but I am certainly rooting for sum and product types to become pervasive common knowledge to all programmers one day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245927</guid></item><item><title>49.

I then worked hard, graduated out of the PIP, and stayed there a few more years. (I also opted-in to a second PIP (with my manager's knowledge and assistance) when I was leaving so I could get severance, but I don't really count that)One of my current mentees got put on a PIP a couple years ago, and she likewise has significantly improved. (She also survived a round of layoffs a year later, which should speak to that)So while PIPs might be started with the expectation that most employees won't improve, I think they're also started with the hope that they will.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “A lot of the time, they’re done,” Gadea said of underperformers. “They’re burned out, they need a break. And now you’re asking them to work harder.”I've seen that once, most recently.Before that, it was somebody who was trying to get let go on performance grounds, thinking that it would lead to severance (didn't work out).Before that, it was somebody who got put on PIP, but I'm not sure why, and they were personally devastated and then quit.Telling somebody that they're fucking up and that they need to improve is one thing, that's just feedback. Creating a structure that's officially "if you don't do X, Y, Z, then you're fired"... just fire them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273798</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how traditional public relations (PR) processes can negatively impact employee morale and productivity within organizations. It emphasizes that outdated PR practices often lead to inefficiencies, lack of engagement, and communication barriers among teams. The author advocates for a more modern, collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency, inclusivity, and flexibility, which can enhance team dynamics, boost morale, and ultimately improve productivity. By rethinking PR strategies, organizations can foster a healthier work environment that supports both the company and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I’ve recently come across a discussion where a new developer joined a team and faced over 300 PR comments on their first contribution. Most of it was stylistic nitpicking. This isn’t just unproductive, it’s outright toxic.For me this says more about the company culture than any inherent flaws with the code review process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My team has a bike shedding sort of problem where a 100 loc PR will sometimes get scrutinized to hell, but a 3,000 loc PR will get LGTM'd by enough of the team to be merged before anyone that actually cares gets a chance to look at it. I would say the second half of that is the much bigger problem.People know who to ask to get a quick lgtm.I don't know what to do about it. I can't make people actually review. I've had unrealistic dreams like holding people responsible for things they approved that had bugs, but anything like that would be supremely unpopular. I could do something like requiring review from the team members that actually review, but they already feel overwhelmed by being the only ones that actually review.We tried setting soft limits on the size of PRs, but that comes with a lot of PR that are hard to review because the work is poorly divided and doesn't make sense in isolation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever I encounter a pull request that I find many issues with, I ask to meet with the engineer and review it one on one. More than half of the workplace problems engineers have is due to their introverted nature and their refusal to get on a teams/zoom call to explain their issues and get resolution. Comments are a really poor mechanism for teaching programming best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274003</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love this type of art. I make digital geometric art, currently complex tilings, at https://andrewwulf.com (not selling any, just showing it). Geometry and math can be very appealing to people although it’s not that popular commercially today outside of NFTs. Repetition and variation can be powerful tools in art. Wacław deserves more recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to this post and a comment referring Iterated Function System, two polish people are interestingly connected in the field of the subject: Wacław Sierpiński (Sierpiński triangle) [1] and "Wacław Szpakowski", they could even met at the time.Another interesting thing about such connections is trying to find a mention of them both in the same media (web page, research paper, etc) so thanks to this a very promising book is found "Art, algorithm and ambiguity. Aesthetic ambiguity with regard to metacognition based on visual semiotics, visual rhetoric and Gestalt Psychology" by Axel Rohlfs [2]. This method sometimes works in other fields, if a researcher is aware of a couple obscure facts, names or entities in a field, he or she is usually very good at the field or at least dedicated enough time to it[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wac%C5%82aw_Sierpi%C5%84ski[2] https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/8576/1/Rohlfs_Art...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you like this sort of thing, there is a whole movement called “Op Art” you should check out[1].  People like Bridget Riley in particular. I saw the big Riley exhibition at the Tate in 2003 and it was fantastic. They had this enormous one-off piece that had been specifically created for this exhibition on the first wall you encountered as you went in.  It was basically a massive very bright white wall with a quite spacious grid of 3/4 circles in black. The gap in each circle was rotated as you looked across and up and down the wall. It was such a perculiar optical effect it made your brain hallucinate colours and movement in this purely static, black and white piece.I knew Bridget Riley’s work a bit before going into the exhibition because she was one of the visual artists you learn about when you study 20C music, and so I had seen a few of these op art pieces, but I never expected an illusion to work so well on such a huge scale.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_art&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42277850</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of sleep for overall health and well-being, highlighting its various stages and benefits. It explains how sleep impacts physical and mental functions, including memory consolidation and emotional regulation. The piece also addresses common sleep disorders and offers practical tips for improving sleep quality, such as establishing a consistent bedtime routine and creating a conducive sleep environment. Overall, the content emphasizes the necessity of prioritizing sleep as a critical component of a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS), a benign mutation that allows them to sleep 1-2 hours less than the recommended 7-9 hours, without experiencing the negative effects of sleep deprivation.Sleep deprivation is one concern, but there’s a more subtle impact on cognitive functions (working memory, creativity, deep focus), overall health (particularly the endocrine and immune systems), and long-term health outcomes (such as an increased risk of dementia).When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules. However, I noticed a stark contrast: many of my math friends consistently slept 9–10 hours a day. They needed that—not just to function in daily life but to achieve the deep focus required for their work. Living on less sleep might not affect immediate action (and in some cases, it might even seem to enhance focus on doing), but it can impair deeper, more complex thinking.Some suggest that one of sleep's key roles is to help the brain regenerate. Chronic sleep deprivation, in turn, is linked to a higher risk of dementia. For anecdotal evidence: Churchill and Thatcher, known for boasting about sleeping only 4–5 hours a night, experienced significant cognitive decline later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, discussion of orexin receptor stuff! As someone with clinically-diagnosed insomnia, I've been lucky enough to/unfortunate enough to have to try the orexin receptor antagonist sleep aids for a while. As recent, on-patent drugs, they are very, very expensive ($360/month was the number marked on the receipt slip, not that that means much in the US; I certainly wasn't paying that)... and they work. They really, really do work. I was prescribed them because I tried every single other class of sleep aid on the market and they were mostly ineffective, had massive side effects, or were benzos (temazepam: best sleep of my life, but better not use it for longer than a month!).This stuff? Orexin receptor antagonists? They work. Holy crap, do they ever work. Sleep quality better than the Z-drugs, great tolerability, no massive disruption going off them... when these things go off-patent they're going to be massive. Sleep quality was not perfect (maybe 80% of "normal"? I don't know) but that is absolutely minor compared to the alternative.(And for the record, I'm off them now due to other stuff clearing up such that I don't need this level of sleep assistance anymore. Not because I can't afford them.)I guess that's a long-winded way to say that if you're going to do questionably-advised sleep biohacking, orexin receptors are probably the place to start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's notable that almost every animal sleeps in some way, even organisms that are away from sunlight (ie. creatures that live underground).If you sleep 30% of the time, that's 30% of the time you aren't eating, mating, etc.  Also, during sleep you are more vulnerable to predators.    One would expect evolution to get rid of sleep in creatures who don't rely on sunlight cycles.So, there must be some really good evolutionary reason for sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279454</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During my teenage and college years in the 2000s, I was inspired by what I’ve read about Bell Labs, and I wanted to work as a computer science researcher in industry.  I’ve also been inspired by Xerox PARC’s 1970s and 1980s researchers.  I pursued that goal, and I’ve worked for a few industrial research labs before I switched careers to full-time community college teaching a few months ago.One thing I lament is the decline of long-term, unfettered research across the industry.  I’ve witnessed more companies switching to research management models where management exerts more control over the research directions of their employees, where research directions can abruptly change due to management decisions, and where there is an increased focus on profitability.  I feel this short-term approach will cost society in the long term, since current funding models promote evolutionary work rather than riskier, potentially revolutionary work.As someone who wanted to become a researcher out of curiosity and exploration, I feel alienated in this world where industry researchers are harangued about “delivering value,” and where academic researchers are pressured to raise grant money and to publish.  I quit and switched to a full teaching career at a community college.  I enjoy teaching, and while I miss the day-to-day lifestyle of research, I still plan to do research during my summer and winter breaks out of curiosity and not for career advancement.It would be great if there were more opportunities for researchers to pursue their interests.  Sadly, though, barring a cultural change, the only avenues I see for curiosity-driven researchers are becoming independently wealthy, living like a monk, or finding a job with ample free time.  I’m fortunate to have the latter situation where I have 16 weeks per year that I could devote outside my job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, I'm really in a sad mood, so: tell me there will be places like that, again, somewhere, ever ?We need this. Like, really, we need someone to have created the xerox part of the 21st century, somewhere about 20 years ago.I honestly though Google would be that - but apparently it's easier to fund R&amp;D on "selling copying machines" than "selling ads". Maybe "selling ads" earn _too much_ money ? I don't know.I know, I know, DeepMind and OpenAI and xAI are supposed to fix climate change any time soon, and cure cancer while they invent cold fusion etc, etc... and it's only because I'm a pessimistic myopist that I can only see them writing fake essays and generating spam, bad me.Still. Assuming I'm really grumpy and want to talk about people doing research that affects the physical world in positive way - who's doing that on the scale of PARC or Bell ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone wants Bell Labs, but not the thing that made it possible — high corporate profit taxes. They were making  bucket loads of monopoly money and had to put it somewhere or taxes would it away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275944</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article shares insights from 15 years of indie app development by Lukas Petr, emphasizing key lessons learned throughout the journey. He discusses the importance of focusing on user needs, the value of maintaining flexibility, and the necessity of continuous learning and iteration. Petr highlights the significance of marketing and networking, the challenges of financial stability, and the impact of community engagement. The narrative serves as both a reflective account and a set of practical tips for aspiring indie developers, reinforcing the idea that success in app development is a combination of passion, persistence, and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an indie developer for the last 10 years my key learning is writing apps for “under privileged” communities. Firstly, it’s a niche. Secondly, people really value your effort and appreciate giving. This creates a nice feeling.I have created my major app, Time Nomad [1], out of pure curiosity. Don’t laugh, scientific minds… I wanted to see how astronomy and astrology coexisted for hundreds of years without all that new age nonsense that corrupted the ancient discipline.So I made it different. It’s more of a toolkit to calculate and grok movements of celestial bodies and find moments of specific alignments. That is pure fun. I have enjoyed maths and computational challenges, while the users surprised me by liking the app’s ability to give quick answers about what (and equally importantly when) is happening in the sky — from an astronomical standpoint. No voodoo language needed, just pure geometry.Why am I saying all this? Taking an old idea and giving it a new modern spin can win hearts. There are communities of people who are open to support that.[1] https://timenomad.app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bit off-topic, but I have been searching extensively for exactly your Timelines app.[1] After listening to an episode of Hidden Brain, with guest Cassie Mogilner Holmes who studies the "illusion of time scarcity"[2], I've wanted to reproduce her self-reflections on where she was spending her time.Edit: After just an hour or so, I'm inspired. Not only am I excited to use your app to track my time, but—as an app developer—I'm inspired by the user experience you've designed. I can't thank you enough for the "export to file" feature.[1]: https://timelines.app/[2]: https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/taking-control-of-your-time/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would add this advice: 1) start by working on your apps on the side while working another job, 2) while working said job, save and invest. Over time this can provide the cushion necessary to jump to full time indie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213811</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;Nodezator is an open-source visual programming environment designed to simplify the process of creating and manipulating nodes for various applications, particularly in the realm of game development and multimedia design. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to create complex behaviors and systems without extensive coding knowledge. The project emphasizes modularity and flexibility, encouraging collaboration and customization. It is built with Python and aims to empower indie developers by making node-based programming accessible and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a few questions
- Is this inspired/based on the Blender node editor package?Some stylistic choices look very much taken from there, even if some other details (eg font) look much more primitive- If it’s not based on that, why?Blander has an Excellent Python-based cross-platform ui which is completely open source. I’ve always thought it’s a crying shame that’s not available as a package to build desktop apps. And I think it would be very good to take things from there, like their very mature graph editor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great work, I love node based uis! I'm still looking for an isolated minmal python package that soly does the backend part of these graph node frameworks like comfy, n8n, or node-red. I.e loading json &amp; serialziing, executing nodes. Which also includes the various ways of processing nodes. Like topology sort, node executing queues. If you all know something lmk!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can see some advantages of this kind of editor for specific contexts, like if you’re building a shader, this UI forces you to be purely functional without explicitly teaching purely functional concepts.But it seems like there’s also a general feeling that this is easier than learning how to code, and I guess my question is… is it? Is this really a better idea than a simple to use API with a DSL (or just a simple language like Go or Lua). Is it just less intimidating to beginners?You still have to learn the concepts and rules of the system, in addition to figuring out cable management. It seems to make documenting your “code” a lot harder. And now with AI assistants, you’re giving up even more by not working with text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274399</guid></item><item><title>6. Safe relational database queries using the Rust type system</title><link>https://blog.lucasholten.com/rust-query-announcement/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the launch of "Rust Query," a new query builder for Rust that aims to simplify and enhance database interactions in Rust applications. It highlights core features such as a user-friendly API, strong type safety, support for various databases, and the ability to write complex queries. The author discusses the motivation behind developing Rust Query, emphasizing the importance of performance and ease of use for developers. Additionally, the post includes examples and a call to engage with the community for feedback and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280570"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My main concern with application-defined schemas is that this schema is validated by the wrong system. The database is the authority on what the schema is; all other layers in your application make assumptions based on effectively hearsay.The closest we came so far to bridging this gap in strictly typed language like Rust is SQLx, which creates a struct based on the database types returned by a query. This is validated at compile time  against a database, which is good, but of course there is no guarantee that the production database will have the same types. Easiest mistake to make is to design a query against your local Postgres v15 and hit a runtime error in production running Postgres v12, e.g. a function like gen_ramdom_uuid() doesn't exist. Another is to assume a migration in production was actually executed.In duck-typed languages like Ruby, the application objects are directly created from the database at runtime. They are as accurate as possible, since the schema is directly read at application startup. Then of course you see developers do something like:    if respond_to?(:column_x)
        # do something with column_x
    end

To summarize, I think application-defined schemas provide a false sense of security and add another layer of work for the engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL, while not great, does have some advantages that are hard to beat:- Everyone knows at least some basic SQL, even non-technical users have often encountered it in some form.- The documentation for eg. PostgreSQL is for SQL, so if you write queries in anything else you have to mentally translate back and forth, and so you need to know SQL anyway.- Any external tools you use to interact with the database will use SQL.- Changing the queries doesn't require an expensive compilation step - `sqlx` gets the best of both worlds in this respect, in that it is able to type-check the parameters and rely on the database itself to validate the query, so you don't end up with a ton of type-system shenanigans that increase compilation times.Maybe for a brand new database, a better query language could win out, but having used sqlx I can't imagine going back to a query-builder style interface for existing SQL databases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;My opinion is that SQL should be for computers to write. This would put it firmly in the same category as LLVM IR.This is nuts.SQL is a high level language. It's higher level than python or rust. It's basically a declarative statement that's almost english-like and it's specifically DESIGNED to be more readable and easier to use by humans. It compiles down into many procedures that don't easily map to the SQL statement itself. You can't get any higher level than SQL.The issue here is that the database exists at the bottleneck of web dev. It's where state mutation happens and it's essentially usually the slowest part of the pipeline in a computer. Yet instead of having fine grained low level control over this part of the pipeline, we have a high level language on top of it. So if we want to optimize this part of the pipeline we have to HACK the query. We have to make the abstraction layer leaky in the API itself with EXPLAIN. We can't do direct optimizations because SQL is so high level. It is a bit of a problem but the industry is so entrenched in SQL that it's actually 10x more efficient to just use it then to develop an API that's more appropriate for this level. SQL is tech debt we are sort of stuck with. The ideal API would be one that is both high level but allows fine grained control... but we don't have one yet.To use machine learning analogies. SQL is a local optima. There's a much more optimal language somewhere in this space but we are stuck in the local optima and it's likely we will never end up finding the actual optimal api.In short SQL is the furthest thing from LLVM IR. It's crazy. You cannot treat it as the same thing. If you do there are huge problems.The problem with rust query and the problem with ORMs in general is that the API for these libraries are in itself high level. They are HIGH level abstractions ON TOP of high level abstractions. You want to optimize a query now? Well you need to hack the first high level abstraction in such a way that it hacks the second high level abstraction such that it produces optimized compiled procedures. That's the problem here.All this ORM stuff is just programmer OCD. We don't want to do meta programming where we have another language living as a string in our web app. We want everything fully integrated so we create an abstraction in attempt to get rid of an abstraction that was intended to be an abstraction in itself. It's aesthetics and the aesthetics actually makes life harder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280570</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the purpose and structure of linker scripts in programming, particularly within the context of embedded systems. Linker scripts dictate how the linker arranges the sections of code and data in memory, allowing developers to manage memory layout, allocate specific addresses for different segments, and ensure the correct mapping of various program components during the linking process. The content emphasizes the importance of customizing linker scripts for optimizing memory utilization and performance in embedded applications, providing insights into common commands, syntax, and usage examples to facilitate understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;linkers are a hot spot for innovation in infrastructure now.LTO (link time optimisation) is the hot topic for Apple’s new generation of linkers, enabling them to optimise across functions, etc.All languages are trying FFI (foreign function interfaces) and need to bridge different calling conventions (mostly collapsing to the arch-dependent c convention).Some AI Companies like Modular are combining pipeline services with optimisations at low levels. Python has legs because it can achieve targeted performance by lowering to c or GPU/TPU/NPU but it can hard to combine them.But these are hard and mostly hidden challenges. Most developers and leads will top out at understanding how to recognise and manage link time errors and bugs.(My hope is that inter-op being mostly intractable could drive languages to agree on something more principled than legacy c conventions, but it would take a large player to shepherd agreement, and they have little interest in inter-op)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plenty of assembly files do not use the C preprocessor. It turns out that assemblers have their own macro system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the look and feel of this page. Can someone spot a hint to the generator/stack or maybe even the page source?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212107</guid></item><item><title>8.

Partly because of reasons like this where the manufacturer can just randomly decide to disable it, but also because its usually the software equivalent of Swiss cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 years ago, https://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/articles/u-s-supreme-co...&gt; U.S. Supreme Court Holds that Books Printed and Sold Abroad May Be Freely Resold in the U.S. Because the Copyrights Are Exhausted Under the First-Sale Doctrine.. The Kirtsaeng decision is significant to copyright owners, and it may also have important ramifications for patent owners who make and sell goods abroad that practice a U.S. patent.https://www.iveticlaw.com/owning-vs-controlling-understandin...&gt; The first sale doctrine is a legal principle that limits the copyright owner's control over a particular copy of their work after it's been lawfully sold.  This doctrine, in essence, acts to cut off the copyright owner's rights in the created work after the product is first sold (ie. when the copyright owner releases their work into the marketplace).  Another way to describe it is that the copyright holder's right to control the distribution of their work goes away after the “first sale” of the work,(hence the name). In more straightforward and more practical terms, once you buy a book, CD, DVD, artwork or any other authorized copy of a copyrighted work, the copyright owner generally loses the right to control what you do with that specific copy. You can resell it, lend it, give it away, or even destroy it, without their permission. Remote bricking requires software, which is sold under copyright law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279010</guid></item><item><title>9.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_exploration_of_t...The Russian space program, despite having many firsts and many successes, had a huge number of failures early on with interplanetary probes and fell off almost completely by the mid-70's. Meanwhile Europe and Japan, both often viewed as lackluster space powers due to their lack of manned space programs, have contributed massively to solar system exploration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; On March 1, 2025, Europa Clipper will reach Mars’ orbit and begin to loop around the Red Planet, using the planet’s gravity to gain speed. [...]&gt; At Mars, scientists plan to turn on the spacecraft’s thermal imager to capture multicolored images of Mars as a test operation.The positive thing about space being so large is that the further we go, the more of the neighbourhood we visit to take pictures of (as we need their gravitational assistance in our travels)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So cool!

Burl coffee tables, cell phone cases, jewelry boxes, guitars, you name it.I should start taking classes now so that I’ll be ready to pivot to woodworking when AI replaces engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So the works Cindy displays are beautiful but is wood turning the way to "make the most of your burl"?
I feel like there's a value that's related the surface area you can get out of a given burl. If you have a burl, are you better off trying to cut thin panels with parallel slices? With turning, though a skilled artisan can produce a beautiful result, don't you lose out on a lot of volume?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great.I used to avoid burl when I would make wood rings [1]. It's just very hard to predict how it'll behave if you try to steam bend it.[1] https://woodaround.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280049</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Either I haven’t seen this before, or forgot it, but it’s surprising because I use the sum of independent uniform variables every once in a while — the sum of two vars is a tent function, the sum of three is a smooth piecewise quadratic lump, and the sum of many tends toward a normal distribution. And the distribution is easy calculated as the convolution of the input box functions (uniform variables). Looking it up just now I learned the sum of uniform variables is called an Irwin-Hall distribution (aka uniform sum distribution).The min of two random vars has the opposite effect as the max does in this video. And now I’m curious - if we use the function definition of min/max — the nth root of the sum of the nth powers of the arguments — there is a continuum from min to sum to max, right? Are there useful applications of this generalized distribution? Does it already have a name?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If X1...Xn are independently uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 then:P(max(X1 ... Xn) &lt; x) =P(X1 &lt; x and X2 &lt; x ... and Xn &lt; x) =P(X1 &lt; x) P(X2 &lt; x) ... P(Xn &lt; x) =x^nAlso,P(X^{1/n} &lt; x) = P(X &lt; x^n) = x^nI guess I am just an old man yelling at clouds, but it seems so strange to me that one would bother checking this with a numerical simulation.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses alternatives to using React for building user interfaces, highlighting various frameworks and libraries such as Svelte, Vue.js, and Solid.js. It emphasizes the benefits of these alternatives, including simpler syntax, better performance, and less overhead. The author shares insights on the evolving landscape of web development, encouraging developers to consider different options based on their project requirements and personal preferences, rather than defaulting to React. The piece serves as a guide for exploring diverse technologies that can offer different advantages in frontend development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279172"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having seen some large react codebases I’d agree wholeheartedly with this article.React solves problems we don’t have any more (eg IE), badly, at the cost of poor performance, lock-in and a host of other problems that other solutions just don’t have.It means downloading MBs of javascript just to render a simple page.It encourages multiple loads of massive json payloads for bits of the page which are then translated into html, thus is a huge complexity and network tax for no gain.It encourages constant re-rendering of page components.It encourages mixing code and layout, making it incredibly easy for junior developers to make a terrible mess.It encourages splitting web pages into thousands of components with poorly defined boundaries and putting lots of logic on the front end - this is disastrous for productivity and clarity when the project is of any size.It has a bunch of legacy stuff (double rendering, useEffect, useMemo etc) which just isn’t required and are typically solutions to problems react created.As to a prescription for what to use instead of react - anything else which is not ‘modern javascript’ would be a good place to start. Start with server side rendering and stateless web pages, add interactivity and dynamic loading as required (this is really very easy).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading over the authors primary reasons to not use React, they strike me as fundamentally misguided - mostly solving problems that most people don’t have.One reason it says that React is a poor choice is performance issues. But front end performance issues are almost never the most pressing issue to deal with. React performance concerns in the real world are typically measured in, at worst, hundreds of milliseconds. Yes, there are a few specialized domains where this will matter. No, you probably don’t work in one. Greater leverage can almost always be derived from improving the backend.The second reason the author says is that it’s based on a legacy eventing system which supports IE. The author goes on for quite a while to say how bad this is, but I question the assumption it’s predicated on: the legacy eventing system never bothers me, and it doesn’t create issues visible to my users. As far as it seems to me, this argument is akin to saying that React hasn’t bothered refactoring an old part of the code base. Yes, that’s not great, but it hardly strikes me as a reason to drop a framework entirely.Finally, the author doesn’t actually give a prescription as to what to use instead of React. This is, personally, where the argument really falls apart. React does make a set of tradeoffs, I don’t deny that, but most alternatives I’ve seen make a worse set of tradeoffs that shift more work onto the engineer. Of course, since the author doesn’t actually highlight any alternative, we can’t have a discussion about what you’re trading away, but I suspect that the author makes no proposal because he knows that any alternative would immediately be shot down as obviously worse than React.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been building sites since the 2000s and I'll let you know why React or jQuery "won."It's because when you write code using these libraries, your code looks nice.I cannot say that for a LOT of libraries, especially MOST frameworks. Sorry for calling AngularJS out but look at a code sample from early Angular: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42823436/angularjs-error... (It looks terrible.)React will be unseated like jQuery got unseated when someone makes something that looks nicer. Every time you write a library (or even API at work), make sure to look at your code samples and you better be 100% be able to say "this is pretty."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279172</guid></item><item><title>13.

I'd like to know how it's different from Lem and Emacs-NG.I gladly welcome "macsen" and note some other great programs in the tradition:    Emacs (OG)
    Genera (OS)
    Climacs (CL)
    TeXmacs (DTP)

Honorable mention: Plan 9, Pharo, gforth. Anything I missed?This store or using the computer is vastly more  satisfying than rigid, compiled button-driven interfaces and makes me feel like my computer is much more a "bicycle for the mind" than a on-rails haunted house ride for the mind. I'm using Spacemacs with EXWM as my "desktop" in Guix these days and loving it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a hard sell:      sudo chown root electron/chrome-sandbox
      sudo chmod 4755 electron/chrome-sandbox

Installing a new setuid root binary?  I guess that the sandbox process is small, and not really electron, but just hearing "electron" and "setuid" in the same sentence is enough to make me run away!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I'm not an Emacs user I like the philosophy of it. And I like text editors.That said, I use orgmode on android (orgzly) and used it on sublime text (orgextended), that's a nice feature. 
I know one guy who uses emacs and when I heard of lem (https://github.com/lem-project/lem) I told him. (Lem is also in CL)He was quite enthusiastic of it, but 2 or 3 things were missing at the time, the first of all you guessed it, it's org-mode, second was magit but he could use lem without it and finally it was a plugin manager (but we agreed it is a lot of work).I don't know what are your plans but I hope I could give you some ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220304</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm surprised they dismissed the OSSC [1] so easily. It's not "just" for game consoles and arcade equipment. It has a VGA port on it for a reason!Admittedly I haven't used it for anything nearly as "esoteric" as some of the gear Cameron has I'd be surprised if he encountered any issues. Though being open source I'd suspect if he did he could simply fix them himself in the OSSC's firmware if needed!An OSSC will happily upscale any weird resolution/framerate you feed it to something modern HDMI devices can "understand". I use an "EVGA XR1 Lite" [2] to take the OSSC's HDMI output and feed it in over UVC to my laptop with USB-C. Works flawlessly and is dirt cheapIf Cameron wants a bit more of an "all-in-one" solution, myself and other retro tech youtubers like Tech Tangents, RetroRGB and others use old Datapath RGB E1S cards [3]. This thing is basically just a DVI port glued to an FPGA. It doesn't care about "resolution" or "refresh rate" it just DMA's raw pixel data right into RAM and lets what ever application you point at it decipher it. Personally I think they're pretty awful (comparatively) to the above option. The driver is a binary blob (so it probably won't work on Cameron's POWER machine) and it crashes a lot both under Windows and Linux. Though it seems more agreeable under Windows for changing resolution and other settings via OBS[1] https://www.retrorgb.com/ossc.html[2] https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=141-U1-CB20-LR[3] https://www.datapathltd.com/datapath-products/video-capture-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've got a mono-&gt;VGA cable for my STe, and it doesn't work with all LCD monitors. I've got a 4:3 1280x1024 display that (after tweaking display settings) resolves it to a pretty clean 1280x800 with a border at the bottom, but I tried it with a couple of displays a friend has and it seemed impossible to get it quite right. The output was very similar to the nasty screenshots shown here: monitor's pixel sampling always slightly out of sync. I wonder if it's the same phenomenon.I vaguely remember 70 Hz and 72 Hz being VGA standards, so the ST's 71.25 Hz (or whatever it actually was) could be a bit of an oddity.(The Nextstep output doesn't look that awesome either! Hard to say whether this is the converter or whether it's like that it source thouh.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oooh! I wonder if I can find one of those. I'd love a way to see all of the Amiga screenmodes on a single display :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42277604</guid></item><item><title>15.

In the earliest version, an elaborately encoded image reflects sophisticated astronomical knowledge. In subsequent stages this was forgotten and replaced by traditional knowledge, which was focused on the interaction of the heavenly bodies and the horizon; and finally, this reduced knowledge gave way to mythologyIt's interesting that the oldest part of the artifact has the most advanced astronomical information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definitely one of the most awe-inspiring museum visits for me in Germany.https://www.himmelsscheibe-erleben.de/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you have deduced that stars are distant suns if you'd lived in the ancient world?Apparently the only pre-modern people (i.e. pre-Giordano Bruno) recorded as making the claim were Anaxagoras, and Aristarchus of Samos, but their ideas were completely rejected by contemporaries.In retrospect, it just seems so blindingly obvious that I'm tempted to believe that I too would have seen through the Aristotelean BS. But surely there must be aspects of reality that will seem similarly obvious to future generations, and yet I don't feel any insights coming on.I should say, Aristarchus is the ideal of maximizing information from minimal data:&gt;Aristarchus of Samos (Samos is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea) lived from about 310 to 230 BC, about 2250 years ago. He measured the size and distance of the Sun and, though his observations were inaccurate, found that the Sun is much larger than the Earth. Aristarchus then suggested that the small Earth orbits around the big Sun rather than the other way around, and he also suspected that stars were nothing but distant suns, but his ideas were rejected and later forgotten, and he, too, was threatened for suggesting such thingshttp://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274807</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really a great job!This is the old style open source community that I love something and that is often shadowed by big commercial open core projects pretending that they need to change their license because others are using they work...Like in the good old time, such projects are often made by Linux users just desperate to have a good solution to their problems and happy to share it with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The biggest take-away is that they’re expensive (&gt;$100 second hand) and hard to configure when using Linux.The original (or fake, who knows) from Agilent cost that much, yes, but there is AR488 [1], which can be had for pocket money.  I have limited experience myself with it (I got the Agilent one), but it seemed to work just fine.The Agilent one is a bit tricky as its firmware is uploaded when it powers up (is connected to USB) and changes then its ID.  That however is well documented and with recent versions of linux-gpib should just work (it does for me).Then there are GPIB host adaptors for ISA, PCI and PCIe busses.  The latter might be expensive and working PC MB with ISA hard to find, but those with PCI are readily available on the secondary market for reasonable prices.  I made good experience with one from CEC.[1] https://github.com/Twilight-Logic/AR488&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I work on old systems with big parallel buses, so a while ago I bought a big HP 16500C chassis with something like 128 logic analyzer channels.It can handle a full 68000 bus no problem, but it’s cumbersome and unwieldy. (The X11 interface mentioned in the article is nifty though, I remember having the same issue with fonts.)I love my Saleae and even the cheap USB logic analyzers work fine with Sigrok. But everything is either 8 or 16 channels.I realize it’s a niche-of-a-niche use case, but is anyone making USB logic analyzers with 64+ channels at a hobbyist price point (or DIY)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279792</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The repository provides a tool called ntfs2btrfs, which facilitates the conversion of NTFS filesystems to Btrfs, a modern copy-on-write filesystem for Linux. It aims to help users transition from NTFS, commonly used in Windows, to Btrfs, offering benefits such as improved performance, better data integrity, and advanced features like snapshots. The project includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and source code for developers interested in contributing or customizing the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

I think I'd do something like: add a layer that can read other filesystem types and synthesize ZFS block pointers, then ZFS could read other filesystems, and as it writes it could rewrite the whole thing slowly.  If ZFS had block pointer rewrite (and I've explained here before why it does not and cannot have BP rewrite caoabilities, not being a proper CAS filesystem), one could just make it rewrite the whole thing to finish the conversion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42283950</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of good documentation in software development, emphasizing that lack of proper documentation can lead to misunderstandings and errors, akin to superstition. The author argues that when teams do not adequately document their processes and code, they create an environment where assumptions replace knowledge, which can significantly hinder productivity and collaboration. The piece advocates for clear, accessible documentation as a fundamental practice to ensure consistency and clarity in projects, ultimately fostering a more reliable and effective development process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've called this ritual-taboo programming for decades. It happens for user interfaces and APIs when the documentation is absent, or only consists of examples. If there's no reference documentation, everything is a copy of something someone else did. Nobody understands how it really works.Now, for some interfaces, this isn't too bad. Most people don't know why US AC power plugs are polarized, or what the ground prong is for. Electricians have to, but users do not.For more complex interfaces, it means that many functions will either be misused or undiscovered. This is the source of the plaint that only 10%-20% of a product's features are used.On user interface design, the classic is "Tog on Interface", Bruce "Tog" Tognazzini, 1992.
That's from the Mac UI era. A more modern take is "The Gamer's Brain", by Celia Hodent, designer of Fortnite's UX.Software internal documentation seems to suffer today from a mindset that comments are unnecessary and waste space. Especially in the Javascript era. It's worst in languages that don't have data declarations. There's no place to properly document the data.Rust has good conventions and tools for documenting data. There's a well defined place where the documentation for each structure and field goes, and reasonable tools for checking it and turning that into documentation. If you fail to do this, when you publish your crate on crates.io, the documentation pages will come up blank, which screams "loser".Rust is weak on function parameter documentation. There should have been a defined place where each formal parameter gets a comment, which then appears in the documentation of the call.Most other languages don't take such a hard line. More should.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't remember the number of times I have given up on software because there is no “Concepts and Facilities” document that gives me a mental model of what the program will do and how I operate it. Instead, one sees a website with a mass of unrelated documents that I'm supposed to read in some order, and divine how everything works.Maybe because I'm a child of the 20th century that I value documentation that gives me a path from understanding what and why to learning how I can use it, with a master index so I can look up exactly what the “Mung Until No Good” command does, and see which other commands relate to it.Perhaps one day generative AI will be good enough that we can feed in one of these websites, with its pages with titles like “Migrating from V4.7.2 to V4.7.3” and “Building for OS/2 Warp” (I exaggerate, but only slightly) to documentation that is useful for learning, use, and troubleshooting. I live in hope.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's really talking about the user's mental model, here.I've found that it is sometimes a good idea to reinforce mental models that don't actually reflect the operation of the software (in my case) under it.Documentation is good, but, in my experience, almost no one ever reads it. I can tell, because of all the questions that I get, that are in the docs.That's totally my fault. A really good tech writer could probably do a better job of conveying information.That said, I think that it's important to present good, discoverable UI, that doesn't punish users for exploring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254144</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a fun time that was in the aughts for distros. Hardware was rapidly changing and made a lot of new stuff possible. I wonder if there are still emerging hardware platforms to inspire kids today. I had the most fun when I could combine software with hardware, like trying to fit a distro on a floppy, or using the business card CDs to boot a distro into RAM, creating thin terminal clients, routers, firewalls. Feels more real when there's something physical involved.Also worth noting that the concept Robert discusses of avoiding "system rot" is an early example of immutable infrastructure, a game-changing design used to automate fixing state and entropy failures in modern systems. Had no idea that's where it would lead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior to my knowledge of Firefox profiles and multiaccount containers, I used tiny core to isolate my banking, shopping, general browsing, etc; from both each other and my base OS, in virtualbox. I preferred it to other small distros like slitaz and puppy because it was really bare bones and easy to add to.Now you'd likely just use docker, or like me profile and containers for compartmentalisation; aka super paranoia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember making my own distro with TCL :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42282053</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses AMD's decision to disable the loop buffer feature in its Zen 4 architecture due to performance issues and inefficiencies that arose when the buffer was enabled. The loop buffer, intended to optimize processing by allowing quicker execution of repeated instructions, led to problems such as increased instruction latency and higher power consumption in certain workloads. AMD's move aims to enhance overall chip performance and efficiency, ensuring that users experience optimal performance in most scenarios, particularly in performance-sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From another article:"Both the fetch+decode and op cache pipelines can be active at the same time, and both feed into the in-order micro-op queue. Zen 4 could use its micro-op queue as a loop buffer, but Zen 5 does not. I asked why the loop buffer was gone in Zen 5 in side conversations. They quickly pointed out that the loop buffer wasn’t deleted. Rather, Zen 5’s frontend was a new design and the loop buffer never got added back. As to why, they said the loop buffer was primarily a power optimization. It could help IPC in some cases, but the primary goal was to let Zen 4 shut off much of the frontend in small loops. Adding any feature has an engineering cost, which has to be balanced against potential benefits. Just as with having dual decode clusters service a single thread, whether the loop buffer was worth engineer time was apparently “no”."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me the most interesting paragraph in the article is:&gt; Perhaps the best way of looking at Zen 4's loop buffer is that it signals the company has engineering bandwidth to go try things. Maybe it didn't go anywhere this time. But letting engineers experiment with a low risk, low impact feature is a great way to build confidence. I look forward to seeing more of that confidence in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a wild guess, but could this feature be disabled in an attempt at preventing some publicly undisclosed hardware vulnerability?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42283933</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the journey of Honeycrisp apples, originally celebrated for their exceptional flavor and crisp texture, as they became widely grown and commercially available. It examines how the commercialization of Honeycrisps led to changes in growing practices and distribution that ultimately diluted their quality. The piece discusses the impact of market demand, the challenges of maintaining flavor integrity in mass production, and how the apple's status has evolved from a marvel to a more mediocre fruit in the eyes of consumers. The article highlights concerns about biodiversity and the need for apple growers to consider both quality and sustainability in their practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Weird when something on HN hits this close to home. I work in AgTech (automated irrigation) in Washington State. I can attest to the love-hate boom-bust relationship this variety is having with the Washington apple farmer.The article leaves a key point out. This fruit tree is really temperamental to water correctly. Irrigators love and hate this thing. Some fruit bears overwatering gracefully. But with this tree, it begs for water, but if you overwater it even a little, the fruit fails easily. I've watched some big players (Pytech) dump millions of dollars into closed (fully automated), open (just telemetry and recommendation, human then waters) and hybrid loop irrigation methods to try and get this right. It remains a real pain to get right.(edit: the cosmic crisp is also difficult to grow Just Right(tm))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This rankings site [1] was shared on HN a couple years ago [2], and since then I’ve switched to Honeycrisp.While I agree they aren’t always the most tasty, they are almost always (like 98%) crisp and never mealy to the point I want to stop eating it, unlike nearly every other breed I’ve tried (which admittedly is only about 7-8 or the most common ones).I will take a less flavorful crisp apple 100% of the time over a mealy apple.So even a mediocre Honeycrisp is, to me, still way better than nearly all the other ones.[1] https://applerankings.com/[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33639206&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the same story for every new variety of apple. It becomes popular because of its positive characteristics (sweetness, tanginess, juicyness, crispness), but then slowly over time it gets cultivated for mass market appeal (uniform color, shape, shelf life) and the variety loses what made it good.The best apple variety is generally the new one. The market is strewn with the discarded remains of formerly good apples like Fuji and Gala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42282476</guid></item><item><title>24.

I think there was a service for this a long time ago but I think the cost for the size was the reason why I didn't buy it.  Do you have any advice on how to paint a figurine?  For some reason Warhammer 40k has been popping up on my YouTube feed and I've been watching a lot of Warhammer figurine videos.  It seems like you need a lot of specialized brushes and skill to make it look nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never played Guild Wars, but I would've definitely loved to do something like this for my Diablo 2 character, or Phantasy Star Online character, or any number of ones I put hundreds of hours into.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;oh wow this looks great and thank you for the guide.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the decline in the quality of Google search results over the years, attributing it to a combination of algorithm changes, increased commercialization, and the prioritization of ad revenue over user experience. It highlights how the search engine is now inundated with ads, irrelevant content, and low-quality webpages, making it difficult for users to find accurate and helpful information. The author argues that this deterioration affects not only the utility of Google itself but also impacts broader digital literacy and the accessibility of knowledge online. Ultimately, the piece calls for a reevaluation of what constitutes an effective search engine in today's digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s been talked about here before, but fundamentally it’s when the advertising guys won the power struggle over the search engine guys. Previously, advertising was a means to fund cool technology (and also get filthy rich).Now it’s just a way to make the number perpetually go up, sucking every last drop of value out of the system.Plus the complete lack of vision or strategy from Google’s senior leadership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Morgan: Literally Danny said he sat with an engineer team with examples of people in the room and said why aren’t they showing up and they did their “debugging process” and couldn’t figure it out.Meanwhile a single Swede with a single desktop class machine in his living room created a search engine so good that I would often switch to it when Google failed.These days I use Kagi, which has prioritization and block lists (which I don't use because the results are good out of the box).Wanna know what is really interesting about the Kagi story?While Kagi is building its own index, for a long time they were kind of reselling a wrapped version of Google + Bing results, but still were extremely much better IMO.I have two theories:- either Kagi has some seriously smart systems that read in the first tens of results and reshuffle them- or more likely in my opinion the reason why results have been so good is because kagi has api access which bypass the "query expander and stupidifier"[1] on the way in to Google and the personalization thing on the way out. That way they just interact with the core of Google search which somehow still works.[1]: "stupidifier" the thing in the Google pipeline that rewrites- "obscure-js-lib" (think one that a previous dev used, that I now need to debug- to "well-knowm-js-lib-with-kind-of-similar-name".Or decide that when I search for Angular "mat-table" I probably want some tables with mats on even if they don't have anything to do with Angular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not precisely sure what problem the author is talking about. Is it the fact that some sites have built a business model around search results or is it that Google changed it search algorithm and they don’t like the way they are prioritized or is it something else?It seems kind of unreasonable to expect Google to never experiment with their algorithm; and unfortunately at its core it is a zero sum game.  You might be a winner today but a loser tomorrow.if your concern is about revenue, sharing or referrals or ad placements or ??? then I would point out that it’s very unwise to build a business whose success is based entirely on the whims of another business.I think search in general is becoming a very poor way to discover content as it is slowly getting planted by LLMs and also for years has been gamified by SEO.I think that the right model for content discovery is either crowd sourced by a like-minded community, like hacker news or curated; if the curator or community drifts away from your interests, then you have to find a new one, but oddly enough, this can actually be done within the same framework.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42277673</guid></item><item><title>26.

Tried it for my research project (tracking cells on microscopic videos) but it didn't work well. Guess it's more suited for real world 3d scenarios&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very impressive. I wish research like this was more deployable. It always seems to come in the form of a muddy ball of Python, rather than e.g. a C++ or Rust library you could actually deploy in a product.I get why, but it still seems a shame that there's all this cool ML research that will only make it into actual products in 10 years when someone with the resources of Adobe rewrites it in something other than Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full, unabridged title (which adds something important!):"SAMURAI: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Zero-Shot Visual Tracking with Motion-Aware Memory"It's the memory part that I find so impressive in the demo videos!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244326</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;WinDepends is a tool designed to analyze Windows application dependencies, allowing developers and security professionals to understand what modules and libraries an application relies on. It provides a user-friendly interface to trace executable files and visualize their dependency chains, helping users identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that all necessary components are in place for proper application functioning. The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub, where users can access the code, contribute to its development, and report issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice project, just as a challenge / piece of feedback - most of the time you don't actually need to have a C backend for this type of project.  The challenge is to get all the P/Invoke signatures and struct declarations / pointer walking correct on .Net.  The benefit being a single managed EXE and no need for cross process communication and the edge cases it brings.(Source: Have built a full SCSI interop layer in .Net to do low level CD ripping, full with native pointer walking and all.  Have also written tools to walk the PEB (process environment block) in .Net w/ no native backends.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is also this: https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies
Similar project for replacing the old dependency walker tool&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never understood why those responsible for Windows SDK dropped Dependency Walker, instead of updating to the new Windows ways of dynamic libraries.Most certainly they keep having similar tooling in Redmond.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220596</guid></item><item><title>28.

Lots of strange little edge cases. Eg, how does rounding work in imperial, can I get 3.1415926535 meters to the closest 1/64th of an inch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;compare ⊤ and ⊥ in APL (a programming language old enough that the pound was not decimal, but still divided into shillings and pence, at its creation):https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Encodehttps://aplwiki.com/wiki/Decode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems similar to the 'ComplexAmount' system I used to use in PHP and JavaScript programs for representing measurements using mixed units.  Basically just a map of unit code =&gt; quantity.  And for extra exactness, quantity would be represented as a rational number.Was useful for a client that let you place orders using a mixture of USD and CAD (the alternative being a lot of 'canada'/'canadian'/'cad' fields added willy-nilly everywhere a cost needed to be represented; I don't know how people can stand to program that way).  But also for generating G-code for a CNC router [1], when sometimes you want to model in mm, and sometimes in inches, and keep all the numbers exact until the last possible moment.[1] https://github.com/TOGoS/TTSGCG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42240896</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an overview of the life and work of Utamaro Kitagawa, a renowned Japanese ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period. It highlights his innovative approaches to portraiture, particularly his depictions of beautiful women, which significantly influenced the ukiyo-e genre. The text explores his artistic techniques, notable works, and the cultural context of his time, emphasizing his impact on both Japanese art and the broader international art scene. Additionally, it summarizes his life events and the themes prevalent in his artwork, showcasing his mastery in capturing the delicacy and emotion of his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, today I learned (from the fifth picture's description) that the Japanese society of the time was not very different than that of what I know of the ancient Greeks, in terms of how men sexually abused boys and young men, as a societally accepted developmental progression.Alexander and Hirohito seem like different versions of the same apotheosis of such cultures, looks to me.Selfishness in a person's greed for sexual pleasure is not a positive force in a society, not for anyone; in fact, it is purely destructive. People -- especially men -- must learn to control themselves. No one should be forced or coerced into serving another person's sexual desires.And, no, no young person should be raised to be the object of another person's sexual gratification. We must raise our children under the roof of compassion for them, to cultivate their emotional and intellectual and spiritual development, so that they become empathetic, positive members of society.Part of the resulting adulthood is, for most folks, being in a mutually beneficial intimate relationship of their own choosing. That is the best outcome for society, on both an emotional and physical level. The physical level relating to disease spread is a real element of our human reality.And however bad it was for those young men, I'm pretty sure it was far worse for women of all ages. Such is the lowness of so many, many men, especially when under the influence of alcohol, which is nothing less than a pox upon humanity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253062</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of reading, highlighting that engaging with literature enriches the mind and enhances critical thinking. It argues that a minimum exposure to books is essential for personal growth and understanding the world. The author emphasizes that reading not only provides knowledge but also fosters creativity and empathy, making it crucial for anyone aspiring to achieve meaningful experiences in life. The title serves as a metaphor for the necessity of reading as a foundational element for a fulfilling journey, whether literal or metaphorical.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's a good writer, but I think he underestimates the implicit skills that an experienced engineer has that beginners don't have. Sometimes it just seems like common sense, but it isn't, and the result is often a lack of empathy.To build up that empathy, being around children or the elderly probably helps. Also, helping a relative who is struggling but you're on their side.Also consider the difference between a native speaker of a language who just kind of knows how to say what they want to say, versus someone struggling to learn the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Then there are engineers [...] who never try for the entirety of their careersThis matches my experience 100%. I am not a brilliant developer by any measure. I'm competent enough, I can put together good solutions to the admittedly low-scale problems I'm assigned, and I like to think I have a pretty good sense for the right and wrong ways of going about doing so. But I'm not even sure I could land an interview with a FAANG company, let alone a job.My feeling at work is one of constant vigilance. I feel like if I look away for too long the gremlins will start creeping in. And I'm not talking about some imperfect design or the odd code smell, I'm talking about dropping in on a PR two senior engineers have already approved and spotting a critical security flaw in the first 30 seconds. Or a data loading pattern that works okay with the five records they've tested against but would make 300 database queries per page for a realistic dataset. Or spend 75% of their CPU time hydrating date objects from timestamps that are then immediately discarded.I think it comes down to a lack of inherent curiosity and/or interest and/or passion in programming. To me good programming is a craft—I won't go so far as to say it's as much art as it is science, but I think there is definitely an artistic element to it. Which for me introduces a need to do something well, rather than just ticking boxes and going home. "Painting the back of the cabinet", as it were. If business requirements force me to ship some monkey-patch fix, it gives me a discomfort I can't really put into words. I immediately want to replace it with something better, because I just don't like putting work I know to be substandard out in the world. I'm not even particularly invested in the product and services my employer creates, but if it's my work I want it to be good.Something I often hear is "I couldn't work out how to make &lt;solution we all know to be good&gt; work so I just did &lt;sloppy solution that will need workarounds five seconds after clients start using it&gt;". It irks to me to no end because without fail, what "I couldn't work it out" always means is "the first thing I tried threw up a minor roadblock so I stopped trying". And it sucks because the worse a codebase gets, the more difficult it is to contribute something you can be proud of.Have I just had the misfortune of working at particularly crappy companies, or are things really this bad across the whole industry? I'd really like to think it's the former, but I read articles like this and dread that it's the latter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The section about reading "the right books" is important. I tried reading some self-help books in high school, but after reading a few, you'll realize they are mostly "fanfic" as the author says. I noticed some other patterns in these books.1. Constant self-questioning while reading - "Is this obvious? did I already know this?"2. Lots of examples or stories3. Try to turn a simple metaphor/slogan into a complete philosophy for life - i.e "skin in the game"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42282717</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the release of Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and its implications for web developers and users. It highlights improvements in standards compliance, security features, and the overall user interface changes compared to previous versions. The author reflects on the significance of IE7 in the context of web development and the ongoing challenges faced by developers in ensuring compatibility across different browsers. Additionally, it touches on the strategies developers used to prepare for this new version of Internet Explorer and the impact it would have on web design practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny how eternal the IE6/7/8 struggle felt at the time and now it's essentially ancient history. All that knowledge of how to coax CSS into doing things cross-browser circa 2004-2010 is basically useless to me now. Those years were my HS hobby -&gt; college -&gt; career transition period and it's amazing that I didn't give up because of how god damn convoluted basic frontend development was back then. And it was so discouraging because you could do things by the book (er, spec) and they'd work flawlessly in Firefox, but look assbackwards in IE6.I love/hate that era so much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of us felt like such pioneers in those days. Writing frontend web apps was an emerging and rapidly changing art. Those of us on the bleeding edge read Ajaxian.com and Douglas Crockford. I was writing internal SPA apps for Firefox+IE6 with Prototype.js and ExtJS.My co-workers strongly disagreed with my approach -- to build for Firefox first, then hack it to work on IE. "Why bother when 95% of your users are on IE? That's a waste of time."But those apps are still being used, almost 2 decades later, with no modifications required (besides a couple of weird edge case hacks for later versions of IE).Always bet on the web.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding to the pile of anecdotes of dirty browser hacks we're proud of: In 2002 (few years before Ajax went big) I rolled my own Ajax-y thing using a hidden iframe with a form inside it to send &amp; receive data from the server while the user never saw a page reload. The app I used it on was for a client whose rather bad idea failed a year or so later but I'm proud of my part of it as a junior dev with a crazy idea!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254146</guid></item><item><title>33.

Secondly, there are atleast 50 analytics services out there that are self hostable and they clearly indicate what features they provide. It is good expect value for your efforts but the other person buying for 49$ also needs to see value. Perhaps add a list of features, some GIFs, screenshots of your analytics tool in action showcasing various parts?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Problem is, I didn't feel like paying 9$ a month to see the amount of visitors on a website i didn't even earn anything onYou can self-host Plausible yourself if you don't feel like paying $9 a month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42237107</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses triangle fraud in brick-and-mortar businesses, particularly how scammers exploit the return process to take advantage of retailers. It outlines the methods used by fraudsters, such as returning stolen goods for cash or store credit, and the financial impact of such fraudulent activities on businesses.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a slightly different but also unsettling fraud happen to me this summer.Credit card number stolen most likely at a restaurant by staff. In two hours they ran up $2k of online orders across 6 stores.But here’s the weird part - they shipped everything to me. Mostly in my name but also with my first or last name swapped. I realized this as I was reporting the fraudulent charges to my credit card but then I started getting informed delivery mails from UPS and fedex.Apparently it’s a package interception scam where they try to redirect the package to a different address before it’s delivered. They failed at the second part so I had a dozen packages show up over a couple weeks I then had to deal with returning.Real time suck. Dozens of calls and mails. I didn’t have original purchase order numbers in some cases nor the email address. 
Some stores were not equipped well to handle this, some told me to keep and donate the clothing.  It was all fairly mass market high priced DTC stuff like Bombas.Weird. 
My wife was freaked out that they got our home address from our name on the credit card fast enough to make all these orders in under two hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's crazy about the original story is that you can buy something on Amazon with your own credit card from a highly rated vendor and go to jail because the seller was involved in a criminal enterprise!!!I know Amazon marketplace sells sketchy products, but I didn't know not doing my due diligence there could expose me to criminal liability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could do all that, or just require PINs for credit purchases.  They're not near as good as passwords, but PINs are still much, much better than nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42277925</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses an 83-year-old short story by Jorge Luis Borges that eerily predicts the challenges facing the internet today, such as information overload and the distortion of truth. It highlights how Borges' themes of reality versus illusion resonate in the current digital landscape, where misinformation and shallow content proliferation threaten genuine understanding and knowledge. The author draws parallels between Borges' fictional world and contemporary issues, suggesting that without careful reflection and action, the internet's future may lead to a more chaotic and fragmented society.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a more apt Borges story is 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'— where a clandestine guild creates artifacts from a fictional world with the intent to deceive. The artifacts and the world they allude to carry such appeal to the masses, that they essentially trump the rest of society as a source of truth and annihilate all culture that came before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;As the output of chatbots ends up online, these second-generation texts – complete with made-up information called “hallucinations,” as well as outright errors, such as suggestions to put glue on your pizza – will further pollute the web.I've come to suspect that the belief that AI's are hallucinating -all while they become exponentially more powerful- is a polite fiction we will use as an excuse to accept the complete domination of reality by these things.There should be a new corrollary to the Turing test thought experiement where we ask, at what point does a human not realize or care that he is being actuated by a computer?[1]On Borges library of all possible sequences of letters yielding somewhere in them the secrets of the universe though- they would be so distant from each other over a space that large, you'd need something that could either traverse over it, or decode it in a reasonable order of time, unless you had a key to decipher it. one made of transformers apparently.[1] 42.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange that this appears to be nearly lost to history -- but this is rhymes with kibo's (James Parry) declaration of happynet[1].For a long time I thought that the internet would be like the library described in "The Abortion: An Historical Romance" by Richard Brautigan[2], where anyone can put anything they've written into the library.Somewhat tragic, I guess, that the world's been predicted by kibo not brautigan.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses "long fatigue," a persistent exhaustion that can occur after an infection, particularly after viral illnesses like COVID-19. It explains how this condition can significantly impact daily life, affecting physical and mental health. The piece highlights research on the mechanisms behind long fatigue, including the body's inflammatory response and its effects on energy levels. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing this condition as legitimate and the need for further study to understand its causes and potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really resonates with me. I was a very active (4-5x a week weightlifting &amp; 1-2x cardio) person until about 13 months ago when I got an extremely mild cold. It was barely noticeable and I continued with exercise. 2 weeks later, I still hadnt shaken the fatigue that normally comes with a cold and in fact, it got worse. After a month I sought deeper medical investigation and eventually ended up seeing a cardiologist as I now had palpatations and could hardly walk up a flight of stairs without being out of breath.I had myocarditis, caused by an infection, likely a covid strain but unproven as it was so mild I never thought to get tested. No exercise for at least 3 months and lots of R &amp; R. I did this but I've never fully recovered. I still get pretty bad post exertional malaise, cant tolerate caffeine or alcohol and my sleep is terrible - especially after pushing too hard. Extremely shallow and I wake up a lot. The real nail in the coffin is something about heavy lifting really tips me over the edge. I can do some (very) light cardio infrequently on good days.Doctors have been next to useless in helping, I guess because there isnt any real treatment for what is probably a multi factor systemic problem.Whats been fascinating is my garmin fenix watch has been able to track how I'm feeling to a T. HRV readings have been particularly helpful in knowing whether I should be really dialling back activity on a given day or allowing myself to push a bit more. Ive fallen from a baseline of 85-95ms average to 40-60ms average which is really interesting. I'd love to see what macro analysis of their data would reveal around illnesses such as mine. The sleep functionality has also been quite illumunating. Getting 8 hours used to reset me to 100 body battery, now im lucky to get back to 80 after 11 hours sleeping.Im not alone and I'm lucky enough to have a mild case but it still sucks and has robbed me of a big chunk of my previous life and personality. Im really hoping stories like mine begin to trigger trials and further treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you find yourself with these symptoms (and even if you don't - see below for why), whatever your gender, get your testosterone level checked. We've known for decades that low testosterone causes fatigue and brain fog and the treatment for it has been approved for medical use for over 80 years, but you can go to doctor for "long COVID" and they'll do a blood test for a huge list of things and ignore testosterone, as does this article. If you want it checked you'll probably need to push for it and/or pay extra. There's a stigma around it and it's a controlled substance, but some people simply need it and will not feel normal without it.There's a persistent myth that testosterone production in men falls as a natural part of aging. The truth of what happens to "normal" levels with age is more complex [1] but what is known is that in some people testosterone production falls dramatically and permanently at some point at some point in their life, sometimes after an injury or infection, sometimes for no discernible reason, and it can cause exactly the symptoms described here. When that happens it's not a "male menopause". It's not normal aging. It's pathological and it's treatable. The reason to get your level checked even if you don't have symptoms is so you know your personal baseline and can tell if a sudden change happens later.The situation in women is more complex, and testosterone treatment carries different risks, but androgens are very much part of healthy female hormone production.It's early days but there's been some interesting research about a possible mechanism for permanent changes in androgen production after COVID [2].I'm not saying this is the only cause of long COVID. There's certainly more than one mechanism, and what helps one person can harm another (as with the graded exercise program mentioned in the article, which was entirely counterproductive for me). But it is one of the possibilities and if it were routinely checked for in people reporting these symptoms it would have spared me a few years of hell.1. https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc41901742. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10507138/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "Viral infections may trigger long-term and persistent impairment in one's immune system," says Avik Roy, chief scientific officer at the non-profit Simmaron ResearchThis is also true in a very direct and literal way, where a Measles infection can make you vulnerable again to past diseases, because of the immune cells it attacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42224535</guid></item><item><title>39.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Transport for London (TfL)'s decision to abandon plans for implementing driverless tube trains on the London Underground. It highlights the challenges and complexities associated with transitioning to fully automated operations, including safety concerns, technological limitations, and the need for extensive investment. The decision reflects TfL's focus on maintaining operational reliability and public safety while addressing budget constraints and existing issues within the train network.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve never really understood the argument for driverless tube trains.Take the Victoria line doing approximately a full lap of the circuit in an hour, north to south and back again.That one train with one driver has a capacity of 260 seated, 1000 in total. People get on and off all of the time so the actual usage can be far higher, most people do a few stops or half the route max. Based on riding the tube I would guess that the average train has at least 1000 users an hour e.g. 500 northbound, 500 southbound using this example.If the train driver gets paid £100 an hour (feels high) then it’s 10p per person per trip or approx 30 seconds of work at the minimum wage.The entire thing feels like optimisation for the sake of it, I’m happy for my tube driver to get 10 bloody pence from my fare.  Even if my assumptions are wrong then say it’s 20p or 50p or whatever that feels totally reasonable.A taxi is completely different because in that case the hourly rate of the driver is basically the entire fare, you are pretty much paying for the time of one person 1:1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No doubt the RMT will take the blame for this but as the article points out:&gt; It’s now been confirmed that the study reached the same conclusion that every other study into the issue has already reported — it’ll cost an awful lot of money for very little benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Platform edge doors could be done half-height style without massive rebuilds of platforms. I’ve seen the half-heights in Japan and Malaysia. That also then avoids the need for super precise alignment which is an issue for platforms supporting multiple lines and train types.None of the above would enable driverless trains. It’d just go towards accident reduction —maybe suicide too, depends on the individual’s determination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42278160</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concepts of structured editing and incremental parsing in relation to programming languages and code editors. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the structure of code while editing to improve the efficiency and accuracy of parsing. The author explores how incremental parsing allows for updates to be made to the syntax tree of code in real-time as changes are made, rather than re-parsing the entire codebase. The piece highlights potential applications of these techniques in software development tools, aiming to enhance the user experience and streamline the coding process.&lt;/p&gt;

sys.set_int_max_str_digits(0) # Allows for printing very large numbers.x = (2 * 136_279_841) - 1print(x)```&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42279418</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article says&gt; &gt; This is entirely in keeping with how the KDE project as a whole works: for instance, if you search the KDE Applications website for "text editor", you'll find three: Kate, KWrite, and Nota. If you search for "file manager", you'll find four; and "web browser", three. Within the desktop, there are multiple start-menu tools, multiple app-switching panel-button bars, and so on. Even the "About" option on the "Help" menu is duplicated: one tells you version information (in one of two version formats, either decimal-number based or date-based), and one tells you about KDE as a whole.I think they are ALMOST right. 
Yes, different people use different apps. 
Yes, it should be possible to download fifteen different web browsers or twenty five different text editors. 
However, there should be a coherent DEFAULTS story. 
By default, when you install an operating system, we should have ONE default COMPLETE web browser, one COMPLETE text editor, and so on.I don't think when you install an operating system, 
it should install an office productivity software suite 
such as Microsoft Office or Libre Office by default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll hit a completely opposite tone to the article's and say this is actually pretty honest for once.When the regular person thinks of an OS, they think of the desktop environment provided for the most part. So in my opinion, this is just the right things taking their rightful position.If anything, certain people should now start fearing the incredible potential these decisions have in terms of ecosystem consolidation. Interesting times ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author seems to think that someone should tell all these volunteers to focus their efforts somewhere, and that the volunteers should listen.Fortunately there are proprietary desktops that receive substantial income from hardware sales and licensing fees. Unlike volunteer-led efforts, they have leaders paid to set direction and workers paid to implement that direction. One can use such a desktop and OS, or perhaps one can be grateful that these unpaid volunteers provide an alternative at no charge, no matter how uncoordinated the end product is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280246</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of "runaway technology," which refers to advancements that outpace our ability to understand and regulate them, posing greater dangers to civilization than artificial intelligence (AI). While AI is often portrayed as a primary threat, the piece argues that it is the rapid, uncontrolled progress in various fields—like biotechnology and climate engineering—that could lead to catastrophic outcomes. The author emphasizes the need for more thoughtful consideration and governance of new technologies to ensure they are developed and implemented safely, highlighting the importance of societal decision-making in the face of accelerating technological change.&lt;/p&gt;

And then another approach to that same question would be what apple is doing with in-package ddr5 (which I think I heard amd is copying with a custom line for... Microsoft / azure I think it was?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My understanding is that one factor pushing hyperscalers towards dual-socket was the cost of the network fabric - for the longest time, having two CPU sockets per NIC / per leaf switch port was the overall system price/performance sweet spot for many workloads.   More sockets required more expensive CPUs, while single-socket servers need twice as many NICs and twice as many top-of-rack switchports.With newer/faster ethernet standards you still need twice as many NICs but you can often split the lanes coming out of a switch chip and use a Y cable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article reads like an AMD advertisement for their EPYC processor line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42258442</guid></item><item><title>49.

A ton, because very few can do it, and lots of people want it.Well things may have changed a bit, I see many gamedevs not paid much and many rich streamers youtubers play videogames (even if by person you're more susceptible to be paid writing videogames than playing them still)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something in the tone put me off. It's the standard american "MAX EFFORT" mentality/tone that's fine if you want to get pumped and try for a chance of becoming great at something, but maybe you want to have fun and make sure you don't burn out on the thing you like.Semi-relatedly, I don't know what the better method is: Have discipline, practice all day, study, get better, or like something so much that it's just the thing you'd always rather be doing.I guess the former works when you don't have the latter, but I don't know how many succeeded with each.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate Derek Sivers.  (And he is active on HN, so - hi)Derek does though tend to act in, or advocate for, the absolute extreme.I remember an old story where Derek micromanaged CDBaby knowing how to do every thing including write all the code in Rails. Burning out, he then trusted his employees to run his company completely without him.  Derek  became painfully disillusioned when his employees betrayed him under zero oversight, and sold the company. My thinking reading this years ago was the wise path was probably more reasonable delegation with reasonable oversight.It is ok to reject the shiny extreme. Moderation is beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280708</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;[From the footer: "For those who don’t know this is a parody of The brilliant Story of Mel if you’ve never read it I highly recommend it!"]I like what the author is saying.I, too, just code in my terminal (but with vi, of course ;-), and only occasionally DDG a programming language or bash question. I also kindof miss VS EE, but I don't use or target anything by Microsoft, so no need, really.But, really, I'm just focused on simplifying my coding patterns then being consistent with them. It's an iterative process, where the end goal is as much contraction of the codebase as it is expanding it to add new features.One of (IIRC) Picasso's children said that their father would work on his canvas for a while, then just sit and stare at it, for hours sometimes, and then repeat that process, perhaps over days. Then, one day, after his usual period of just staring, he would say, "It's done.", and would be done.I didn't realize until I was nearly 50 that I'm really an artist who works in code, but here we are.And there, just like in my food, where I abhor articial ingredients, I prefer real intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this actually is a parody like the author claims. It's more of a pastiche, but a pretty bad one since the core conceit of Story of Mel was that it was real, while this is just made up nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funny :) I was thinking about the old story noted at the end of the article while reading this article.Cool little story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42281755</guid></item><item><title>1.

Did it the last 2-3 years in Rust, hanging out in a discord where we all try to make the absolute fastest solutions. Learnt all kinds of crazy performance hacks and some advanced algorithms &amp; SIMD that way.This time I'm trying to do them in Rust and Golang in an effort to either learn to like/tolerate Golang (because we use it at work) or prove my hypothesis that it sucks and never use it unless I have to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This years challenge for me: write it in C without the standard library or an allocator. Has to be runnable on an STM32 with 32kb of SRAM.I tried doing it in Assembly two years ago, ended up spending hours and hours writing an Assembly standard library, then gave up and switched to Rust...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aiming to get all the stars this year to round it out with 500 total - all the years, all the problems.As of last week there were something around 1024 people who had all 450 stars.Only started on like day 6 of 2022, but became hooked and had some time early in 2023 to go through the previous years. Once you have a few algorithms canned, it's not too difficult and some themes repeat across years.It's fun to brush up on stuff you don't touch all the time - actual algorithms and stuff.Hats off to the volunteers and Eric - I aim to donate every year now - it's a great event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42287231</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents research on the concept of "light-matter" hybrid states, particularly focusing on how these states can manipulate and enhance quantum phenomena. The authors explore the implications of this hybridization in various applications, including quantum computing and photonics, and discuss the underlying theoretical frameworks that support these interactions. They emphasize the potential for advancing technologies through the understanding and control of light-matter interactions, paving the way for innovations in quantum information systems and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It looks like the key insight here is to have the LLM generate its own tools (as in GPT/Claude tool calling) via Python code generation and apply cosine similarity RAG to select which tools are available at each step using the tool description and the problem/step while using recent history to error correct.The agent starts with some human created tooling like a tool to read the file system or create another tool using python code, then starts accumulating custom Python functions it wrote itself with tool calling metadata like descriptions and input/output types. Every time it reaches a step, if it doesn't find a relevant tool, it creates a new one. Apparently this improves performance on complex tasks (via GAIA benchmark) with diminishing returns on simpler tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putting this idea out there, haven't seen anyone implement it:Use vector embeddings to represent each task as a story, an abstraction of 1. the past, 2. the present, 3. the future - on a kind of global "story map".Each embedding would be generated by all available sense inputs at a point in time. The most useful embeddings alg will be able to combine sight, hearing, internal monologue, visual imagination etc into one point on a high-dimensional map.At each time step, find the closest successful "memory" (based on embedding of 1+2+3) and do some LLM exploration to adapt the memory to the new, novel situation.Attempt the new "story", and do something like A* to get closer to the desired "future", tweaking the story each time and plotting failed attempts on the embedding map.Theory being that over time, the map will become populated with successful attempts and embedding will be able to abstract between similar situations based on 1+2+3.I'm not the guy to implement it, and I imagine new models training with a "reasoning step" are doing a similar thing at training-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The paper evaluates itself on the GAIA benchmark and it was my first time hearing about it, so I tried to evaluate myself as a human.Here's a level 3 question from the GAIA paper (level 3 = hardest):&gt;In NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon. Use commas as thousands separators in the number of minutes.I timed myself solving the problem. It took me 9 minutes, 5 Google searches, 14 web pages, multiple Ctrl+F in these pages and 1 calculator use to figure out the answer.DynaSaur seems to have a 10% to 20% success rate at this level.Try for yourself. This is one of the few empirically grounded reference levels for how far we are from AGI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42286397</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going meta a bit: comments so far on this post show diametrically opposing understandings of the paper, which demonstrates just how varied the interpretation of complex text can be.We hold AI to a pretty high standard of correctness, as we should, but humans are not that reliable on matters of fact, let alone on rigor of reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems obvious to me that LLMs wouldn't be able to find examples of every single problem posed to them in training data. There wouldn't be enough examples for the factual look up needed in an information retrieval style search. I can believe that they're doing some form of extrapolation to create novel solutions to posed problems.It's interesting that this paper doesn't contradict the conclusions of the Apple LLM paper[0], where prompts were corrupted to force the LLM into making errors. I can also believe that LLMs can only make small deviations from existing example solutions in creation of these novel solutions.I hate that we're using the term "reasoning" for this solution generation process. It's a term coined by LLM companies to evoke an almost emotional response on how we talk about this technology. However, it does appear that we are capable of instructing machines to follow a series of steps using natural language, with some degree of ambiguity. That in of itself is a huge stride forward.[0] https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/gsm-symbolic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You mean you need humans to step-by-step solve a problem so a neural net can mimic it?  It sounds kinda obvious now that I write it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42289310</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using a KEM[1] to create a sealed_box[2] type construct would allow for privacy even in a situation where the camera hardware is physically seized. You could also use ML-KEM (aka Kyber), McEliece-KEM and ECDH or RSA-KEM together to provide post quantum resistance.The traditional symmetric approach (which also has post quantum resistance) in such systems requires the camera hardware to possess the long-lived symmetric key which can be extracted after seizure. Using a ratcheting mechanism (hashing the key every t time) can help - but have no self healing and be vulnerable to recovery from persistent storage (past keys may not be securely erased).[1] &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_encapsulation_mechanism&gt;[2] &lt;https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sea...&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow!!

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have published an addendum to an article I wrote about AlphaChip (https://vighneshiyer.com/misc/ml-for-placement/) at the very bottom that addresses this rebuttal from Google and the AlphaChip algorithm in general.In short, I think the Nature authors have made some reasonable criticisms regarding the training methodology employed by the ISPD authors, but the extreme compute cost and runtime of AlphaChip still makes it non-competitive with commercial autofloorplanners and AutoDMP. Regardless, I think the ISPD authors owe the Nature authors an even more rigorous study that addresses all their criticisms. Even if they just try to evaluate the pre-trained checkpoint that Google published, that would be a useful piece of data to add to the debate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point in time, why wouldn't we give at least benefit of the doubt to Jeff Dean immediately? His track record is second to none, and he's still going strong. Has something happened that cast a shadow on him?

&lt;p&gt;Shader-Slang is a platform dedicated to the Shader Language (SLang), which aims to simplify the creation and integration of shaders in graphics programming. It provides resources, tutorials, and documentation for developers to understand and utilize SLang effectively within their projects. The website offers examples, syntax details, and best practices for writing and optimizing shaders, catering to both beginners and experienced programmers in the field of computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One unique and new feature of Slang that sets it apart from existing shading languages is support for differentiation and gradient computation/propagation - while still cross-compiling generated forward and backward passes to other, platform-specific shading languages.
Before, the only way to backpropagate through shader code (such as material BRDF or lighting computation) was to either manually differentiate every function and chain them together, or rewrite it in another language or framework - such as PyTorch or a specialized language/framework like as Dr.Jit, and keeping both versions in sync after any changes.
Game developers typically don't use those, programming models are different (SIMT kernels vs array computations), it's a maintenance headache, and it was a significant blocker for a wider adoption of data-driven techniques and ML in existing renderers or game engines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also of importance, the Slang initiative supported by Khronos:
https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-launches-sl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The design of generics in this one seems rather well balanced in simplicity vs power.The part about interface-typed values [1] is interesting. They do dynamic dispatch as a fallback when the function is too polymorphic to be be specialized.In Rust terms it's as if it picks between `dyn` and `impl` automatically. It looks convenient, but also a bit of a non-obvious performance pitfall.[1] https://shader-slang.com/slang/user-guide/interfaces-generic...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244472</guid></item><item><title>9.

Now I can use it as a headset for my smartphone or laptop. While you had to learn about SIP and voltage converters I had to learn about Bluetooth and digital audio protocols.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a review of the book "Statistics" by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves, highlighting its key features and educational value. It emphasizes the book’s clear explanations of statistical concepts, its practical approach to data interpretation, and the use of real-world examples. The review also discusses how the authors focus on the importance of understanding underlying principles rather than just computational techniques, making it a useful resource for both students and educators in the field of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on a introductory STATS book for the past couple of years and I totally understand where the OP is coming from. There are so many books out there that focus on technique (the HOW), but don't explain the reasoning (the WHY).I guess it wouldn't be a problem if the techniques being taught in STATS101 were actually usable in the real world. A bit like driving a car: you don't need to know how internal combustion engines work, you just need to press the pedals (and not endanger others on the road). The problem is z-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, have very limited use cases. Most real-world data analysis will require more advanced models, so the STATS education is doubly-problematic: does not teach you useful skills OR teach you general principles.I spent a lot of time researching and thinking about STATS curriculum and choosing which topics are actually worth covering. I wrote a blog post about this[1]. In the end I settled on a computation-heavy approach, which allows me to do lots of hands simulations and demonstrations of concepts, something that will be helpful for tech-literate readers, but I think also for the non-tech people, since it will be easier to learn Python+STATS than to try to learn STATS alone. Here is a detailed argument about how Python is useful for learning statistics[2].If you're interested in seeing the book outline, you can check this google doc[3]. Comments welcome. I'm currently writing the last chapter, so hopefully will be done with it by January. I have a mailing list[4] for ppl who want to be notified when the book is ready.[1] https://minireference.com/blog/fixing-the-statistics-curricu...[2] https://minireference.com/blog/python-for-stats/[3] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwep23-95U-w1QMPU31nOvUn...[4] https://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/A17516BF2FCB41B2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Much of the power of statistics is in common sense, amplified by appropriate mathematical tools, and refined through careful analysis.I hate to be contrarian, but even though I have a degree in statistics, I feel like much of statistics/probability actually violates common sense. In fact, it's probably the most unintuitive field that I'm familiar with.Many of the readers will probably be familiar with the Monty Hall problem or the Birthday problem, but imo, the entire field of statistics/probability is about equally unintuitive/violating of common sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read/worked through Freedman's Statistics a couple of years ago and I walked away from it a different person. I always recommend it when someone asks for a good book to learn statistics from. However, it did leave me craving some of the maths that the authors intentionally left out to make the material more accessible. Freedman's more advanced book, Statistical Models, has you derive many of the results from the first book right at the start, then focuses mainly on linear models. It was a great follow-up which provided the mathematical substance that I felt was missing from the first book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42287345</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the life and contributions of biologist Francis Crick, highlighting his co-discovery of the DNA double helix structure alongside James Watson. It explores Crick's early education, his work in molecular biology, and his later involvement in neuroscience. The piece emphasizes Crick's impact on the field of genetics and the importance of collaboration in scientific research, as well as his views on consciousness and the search for extraterrestrial life. Overall, the article portrays Crick as a pivotal figure in the advancement of life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunate nomenclature aside, this issue highlights the difference between models and reality in science and how students can take these models too literally and thus easily conflate the two in pedagogy. Here's an embarrassing story for me: I didn't realize (or at least didn't internalize) that not all cells in the human body conform to to the canonical image of the cell that we see in Biology textbooks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)#/media/File:Cel...) until I finished oncology and embryology class in my senior year back in 2015. For example, erythrocytes (RBCs) don't have nucleus and mitochondria. Some hepatocytes even have more than 1 nucleus (polyploidy).I still don't know how I went through my cell biology class in sophomore year without understanding this. Maybe I missed the forest for the trees (curse you clathrin mediated endocytosis!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The most significant part of Crick’s idea — and the part that Watson ignored in his oversimplification — was that there are three flows of information that cannot occur, due both to lack of experimental evidence and any plausible biochemical mechanisms. These were protein → protein, protein → RNA and, above all, protein → DNA.These are categorically untrue. Post translational modification of proteins (by proteins) is a thing.  Post transcriptional modification of RNAs (by proteins) is a thing. Transposition of DNA sequences (by proteins) is a thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proteins can cause DNA alterations via chromosomal translocations.If these occur in germ cells, the new sequences may transmit permanently to future generations.Depending on the definition of "information transfer" and the willingness to consider methylation as information transfer, how would the Central Dogma view protein-induced chromosomal translocations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42289798</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Jinbase is a lightweight framework designed to facilitate the development of interactive, data-driven applications using Python and JavaScript. It provides tools for creating web-based user interfaces that can easily handle data and involves features like a built-in HTTP server, a templating engine, and data binding capabilities. The framework aims to streamline the process of building web applications by abstracting common tasks, enabling developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. The GitHub repository includes documentation, examples, and a comprehensive guide to help users understand how to implement Jinbase in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is interesting! I understand the reference implementation of the client being in a specific language, since it kind of has to be to be runnable. But I’m a little off put by the selection of a Python-only serialization format as well. So to implement this in another language, both the Jinbase model concepts as well as the serializer/deserializer have to be implemented. Wouldn’t it have made more sense to use MessagePack or Protobuf or one of the other formats that already has ubiquitous language support? I understand you are the author of the Paradict format but it seems like a non-starter for wide adoption of Jinbase across languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42276813</guid></item><item><title>15.

Feels like a pretty typical cause vs correlation thing.Sometimes getting out of your comfort zone is a good thing.Sometimes that feeling of discomfort is protecting you.Doing that hobby you were always to nervous too try? probably a good source of discomfort to feel.Taking sky diving lessons from the sketchy guy who is not really certified? That is probably the bad type of discomfort and you should listen to it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I relate to this a lot due to personal experiences in seeking discomfort for its own sake. I used to get anxious in social situations, to treat that I intentionally went into random social situations that would make me anxious. Over time, it does make you feel less anxious. But if you stop doing it, your anxiety creeps back.I then realized that change has to be deeper on an identity and lifestyle level. "What is the kind of person you want to become, and what is the kind of lifestyle you want to live" - rather than doing one-off anxiety provoking tasks. In living up to your desired identity and lifestyle, if you face discomfort - THAT is a good discomfort to face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/2022-woolley.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42283678</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities of game development, particularly focusing on managing the balance between technical constraints and creative expression. It explores the iterative process of designing game mechanics, the importance of prototyping, and the necessity of making tough decisions to enhance gameplay. The author emphasizes the need for clear communication and alignment within development teams to ensure that everyone is working towards a shared vision, while also acknowledging the challenges posed by varying skill levels and experiences among team members. Ultimately, the piece serves as a reflection on the intricate nature of bringing a game from concept to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Heaviside's operator calculus, a mathematical framework developed by Oliver Heaviside for solving linear differential equations using algebraic methods rather than traditional techniques. It delves into the concepts of operators as tools for manipulating functions and offers insights into applying these techniques to different problems in physics and engineering. The piece highlights the advantages of using operator calculus for simplifying complex calculations and provides examples to illustrate its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

Particularly renormalization over a calculation that takes place over Feynman diagrams.For decades physicists were happily using this to predict experiment, while mathematicians were tearing their hair out trying to make some formal sense of this, even if only in a limited context. I'd have to do some poking around to find out whether mathematicians are happy about it yet, even though the idea is older than I am.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Heaviside’s Operator Calculus - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=569934 - April 2009 (6 comments)This is also interesting: https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2022/10/12/operational-calcul...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of a rare mineral called "painite," which is known for its extreme scarcity, having been found only once in nature. Initially discovered in Myanmar in the 1950s, painite is distinguished by its complex chemical structure and unique properties. Researchers highlight its significance in geology and mineralogy, as well as the challenges in locating and studying such elusive minerals. The article underscores the ongoing efforts to learn more about painite and the implications of finding rare minerals for understanding Earth’s crust and the processes that create them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm no mineral expert but there's enough info in the TFA to suspect it's rare because no one is mining it or even looking for it. Apparently, it's very difficult to recognize in its natural form and easy to mistake for other less valuable minerals without lab testing.It's just hard for me to imagine the natural processes that formed this grain of it didn't form a lot more of it in the region where it was found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a little surprised there isn't a giant k-way tie for minerals that have only been found once. Like, I get that minerals arise from natural processes, and it's a big planet, so maybe every process should have a potential to occur more than once and perhaps in more than one place -- but many kinds of natural processes create a long-tail distribution where there's a huge number of very rare things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who actually owns the stone currently?

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of skip lists, a data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. The author explains how skip lists function by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, which enhance efficiency compared to traditional linked lists or binary search trees. The piece delves into the mechanics of skip lists, including their probabilistic nature and balancing, and highlights their advantages in terms of simplicity and performance. Overall, it serves as an informative introduction to this innovative data structure in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It's generally my view that from a bird's eye view LSMs are simpler than on-disk Btrees, largely because they are more composable and a lot more of their data is immutable.I dunno about this. On-disk B-trees can actually be pretty dang simple! Both conceptually and in implementation.In concept, for an on-disk B-tree "table", you've got:1. one growable file, or a sequence of fixed-size split files, abstracted over into a "vector of pages" type that you can 1. find the base pointer of, 2. overwrite a full page of, or 3. extend;2. a "metapage" type, that works like the world's most trivial filesystem: it owns a "freelist" of page numbers, and keeps a pointer to the live root of the B-tree; and it embeds its own hash, and a version number.3. a mechanism for discovering/choosing the newest live+valid metapage, essentially making this trivial "filesystem" into a trivial "journalling" filesystem. (in e.g. LMDB, you just have two metapages in pages 0 and 1, that are alternately written to, sort of like double-buffering; on DB open, the newer of the two by version is chosen if it's valid by hash; otherwise the older is used.)4. a readers-writer lock (which doesn't need to be persisted to disk, because the on-disk file is never in a volatile/dirty state. You can just OS-advisory-lock the file — those locks disappear when the creator process dies, which is what you want here);5. read-only transactions, that take a reader lock, discover the newest live metapage, dereference the B-tree root, and pass that pointer off to the user, letting them have at it, reading the B-tree arbitrarily as if it were an in-memory data structure;6. read-write transactions, that take a writer lock, discover the newest live metapage, dereference the b-tree root, set up an in-memory dirtied pages map, and then let you read arbitrarily + write arbitrarily (with reads indirected through the dirtied-pages map, acting as an overlay);7. Copy-on-Write updates to "clean" pages during rw txs, by cloning the clean page contents onto free[listed] pages, dirtying the clone with the update, and adding the dirty version of the page to the dirtied pages map, to overlay the original page;8. a read-write tx commit op that "propagates" the changes from dirty pages, by Copy-on-Write rewriting the B-tree ancestors of the parent pages to point to the new dirty page numbers, until you derive a new B-tree root page — which you then create a new metapage for, fsync the file, and then write the metapage.(Note that this last bit means that a read-write transaction will effectively implicitly "roll back" on crash/power cut — the data is written before the "journal entry" for it, so if the "journal" doesn't make it to disk, then the data updates — including the updated freelist — are "lost". All a failed tx has done is update free pages.)Sure, that's eight things you need to implement. But none of them are complicated or unintuitive, the way that a "lock free concurrent skiplist" is. You could whiteboard any one of those abstractions above with a junior programmer, and they could probably figure out a basically-correct implementation just from the descriptions above.And that means that the implementations of on-disk B-trees are usually pretty short-and-sweet.LMDB, for example, is one C file (https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb/blob/mdb.master/libraries/liblm...) with ~8k of actual code (according to https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).Postgres's durable B-tree implementation (https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/master/src/backend...) is 22kloc, and ~10kloc of actual code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the multi writer skiplist code I think there's a leftover line from the previous example:atomic.StorePointer(&amp;prev.next, node)Apart from that I really like the simulations!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skiplist discussions that don't talk about heap effects are probably incomplete.  The big limitation with skiplists for anything that isn't a "mostly-write-once" workload (something that, it should be noted, doesn't get much benefit from the atomic implementation discussed) is that the metadata record is variable sized, which does bad things to heap fragmentation and cache locality (two things you probably care deeply about if you're going so far as to junk your AVL tree for a lockless data structure) and isn't amenable to the slab-style optimizations used elsewhere.I love skiplists for their simplicity, especially compared with the balanced trees against which they compete.  But the truth is they're very one-trick-pony data structures and don't bring lot to the table as a general choice.  Their home is pretty limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256968</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I credit the C64 that I had as a kid and magazines like COMPUTE! / Compute's Gazette for my career in software.  I taught myself 6510 assembler and started writing some simple demo-like things on that machine, and got hooked on the feeling of creativity that it unlocked.Funnily enough I'd been thinking that it's about time I tried (again, as an older person) to write a game or a demo for the old 64.It's absolutely amazing what people are able to get out of these 40+ year old machines now, and I love that there's still a vibrant scene.In addition to the tools specified in the article, I would also recommend "retro debugger", it's an amazing tool for single stepping through code and seeing what's going on, even letting you follow the raster down the screen to see what code is executing on given scaliness.Also, there are some really good youtubers out there helping to demystify how various games/demos work..  Martin Piper comes to mind as a good example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; My favourite feature, however is being able to use labels instead of line numbers.I guess that's less of a feature and more of a necessity? Actually, this was one of the questions on my mind when I started reading the article. If you remember how those old BASIC dialects worked, you basically decided the line numbers for each line by yourself. The common strategy was to increment by 10, then you had some space to insert additional lines if needed without having to renumber everything (including the destinations of GOTOs and GOSUBs). Subroutines got line numbers in the 1000+ range so they didn't interfere with your main program (example here: https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/GOSUB). Of course this system would be extremely confusing in an IDE that shows the actual line numbers of the source code by default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retro game coders achieve some pretty astounding results sometimes. One of my favorite examples is one who optimized super Mario 64 to such a degree that it runs with much better framerate on the original hardware. Also, multiplayer was added: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_rzYnXEQlE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290861</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the complexities and challenges associated with performing DELETE operations in SQL databases, particularly focusing on the implications of deleting data versus marking it as inactive or archiving it. It highlights how deletes can lead to issues such as data loss, integrity problems, and performance concerns, especially in large datasets. The author advocates for cautious approaches to data deletion, suggesting alternatives like soft deletes or implementing thorough logging and auditing practices to maintain data integrity and allow for recovery if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;DELETE is expensive at a deep fundamental level that we don’t think about much in computer science because we are more worried about losing data. The article is about Postgres but it generalizes. We don’t actually have any computer science for DELETE optimized databases. I’ve idly looked into delete-optimization in databases as thought experiments, since there isn’t much in the way of literature on it, and it is far more difficult than I think many people intuit. The article is partly a manifestation of this reality.I think the nature of DELETE is one of the more interesting open problems in computer science. It is one of those things that, when we require precision, turns out to be very difficult to define.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For example, deleting 1 million rows in a single transaction is a textbook case of what not to do. Instead, splitting the operation into smaller batches, such as deleting 10,000 rows across 100 iterations, is far more effective.Why do I as a user have to do that? Why can't the database implement batching internally and automatically transform my 1-million-rows query into an appropriate list of batched queries?(Edit: Thanks a lot for the answers, that makes more sense - in particular the point that this would also lock one million rows at once)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Unlike DELETEs, UPDATEs don’t trigger cascaded actions - they only involve triggers that are explicitly defined.That's not entirely true.  ON UPDATE CASCADE is a thing for foreign keys, at least in PostgreSQL (which this article is talking about), meaning that the foreign row referencing the row gets updated.  Though, personally, I would never use ON UPDATE CASCADE, as it seems kind of funky.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42233836</guid></item><item><title>22.

What we need is not another Router, there are already plenty out there which work with OpenWRT.What we need are more "level3-"switches with 24/48 ports which work well with OpenWRT.The only really good thing about this is the price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems kinda weird, why one GigE and one 2.5GbE?  Maybe they will make a one plus with double the ram and 2x2.5Gbe?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42285689</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did some development for a server application that supported RS/6000 among other platforms.  AIX on RS/6000 was a nice enough Unix but, being used to Solaris, everything seems just slightly off.  I think it performed slightly worse for the same price as Sparc hardware for our purposes, but some customers wanted an all IBM solution (we also supported an OS/2 client).The main thing that stands out was a tool (smitty?) that could do system configuration and IIRC it could show you the steps to do it manually as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The finest contribution of AIX to Unix, copied (with varying attempts at improvements) by its 90s competitors and eventually into Linux, was its jounal filesystem.The order of magnitude improvements to fsck on bootup and overall filesytem reliability were non trivial.SMIT was abit too non-unixy to catch on but I've always wondered in the back of my mind whether it influenced systemd...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior to POWER on the RS/6000, AIX ran on the IBM PC RT:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RT_PCThis ran on the ROMP processor:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ROMPThis system was a bit before my time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290245</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programming is so different than software engineering, to the point some people (like me) love the former but little by little are starting to hate the latter.Learning for the sake of learning, being able to be picky about what to learn, feeling like a god by creating your own worlds, trial and error… these are all traits of programming. 
On the other hand, software engineering is about sprints, useless deadlines, using the wrong tool for the job, writing code to increase shareholders value, high-performing-team obsession, useless C-level execs, broken tech interviews…Two different worlds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Besides that: find small (2-3 day) project ideas that require you to learn max. 1 new technology or idea, and build lots of such projects.That's how you learn programming. It's not a bad idea, but at least for me software development is more about long term issues coming up, team communication, features that create short term value but long term problems. How to organize big piles of code.A lot of abstractions don't make any sense in a 2-3 days project and you are better of hacking away a script than looking into "properly" modelling things.My impression is always that as a junior you learn how to do stuff. Then you learn to do complicated stuff. And becoming a senior you learn how not to do complicated stuff.This takes some of the fun out of it as well. Deploying a feature that is simple and that just works without any issues does not create nearly as much excitement as "saving the company" with a big hack and high risk deployments, although it is much better to not have to "save the company" in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought this was an interesting read.Key takeaways:1. Spending a career building computer software around others who build software, influences your worldview.2. Programming is a skill (like any kind of craftsmanship or performance art); you learn by doing, not just by reading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280119</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues against canceling Aristotle's ideas, emphasizing that his philosophical contributions are essential for contemporary thought. It highlights the importance of engaging critically with his work rather than dismissing it outright. The author suggests that Aristotle's concepts can help refine modern beliefs and frameworks, advocating for a thoughtful dialogue that combines historical perspectives with current understandings. The piece ultimately calls for a nuanced appreciation of classical philosophy, encouraging us to learn from Aristotle’s insights to enhance our own intellectual endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Aristotle had the greatest mind of any human who ever lived.The older I get the more I realize that there are a thousand true and intelligent things you can say about any topic. Magazines, journals, and libraries are full to the brim of intelligent people writing intelligent things. But an extremely minuscule portion of that huge mass is made of writing that gets right to the heart of the matter.And Aristotle is the writer I've encountered the most who constantly gets right to the essence or core of what he's discussing, moving past the trivialities and the unessential to illuminate deep truths in a logical way. It's why a short essay like his Poetics--which in many ways is a limited work for the modern day because it deals wiih a very specific type of ancient literature--is still pored over by modern writers and screenwriters because of the deep dramatic truths it lays out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His ideas provide a useful filter with words personal qualities, and the moderation of virtues in Nichomchean Ethics pretty much describes what it means when we say someone is 'honest.' it's a foundational read, along with the stoics.the provocative aspect of Aristotle today is that for people who see themselves as not on the level of citizens and who reject being compared by the virtues he (and later, aquinas) articulated, the judgment implies they are somehow moral or spiritual fugitives from it. if I'm not patient, friendly, magnanimous, courageous, charitable, ambitious, truthful, etc, am I really an inferior or less worthy person? according to who? in that sense, the current concept of intersectionality is a kind of secular re-blessing of people marginalized by those values so as to organize them into a movement to dismantle this dominion of judgment by ancient virtues. viewed this way, Aristotle's values and how they support a conceptual moral "kingdom of god" are this movements shared enemy. I get that normal people want to see these things as just human progress vs. quaint old ideas, and not view the value of Aristotle today through the lens of eschatology, but if one did, it illuminates some aspects that should raise at least some eyebrows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In "The Perfect Critic", T.S. Eliot wrote that "Aristotle is a person who has suffered from the adherence of persons who must be regarded less as his disciples than as his votaries. One must be firmly distrustful of accepting Aristotle in a canonical spirit; this is to lose the whole living force of him."I find it curious to see no mention of one rather large institution, the Roman Catholic Church, which for about a century regarded St. Thomas Aquinas as its official theologian and philosopher; and of course Aquinas drew heavily on Aristotle. I have no idea, though, whether neo-Scholasticism persists as a major influence.A number of British philosophers of the last century engaged with Aristotle's ethical writing: Foote, Hampshire, Kenny, and McIntyre come to mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42268319</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems to be lots of advice about finding a new job.If you’re the smartest person in the room, yea, that might be a red flag.But, here’s some different advice though: get the company to hire someone more experienced. Be willing to give up some oversight responsibilities to that person. (Or hire someone who is experienced and explicitly doesn’t want to play the politics game.)I felt like I was in a similar situation fresh out of school. It wasn’t until my company hired an incredibly talented person that I felt I was finally learning from someone (beyond reading books… back in that day, they were still pretty relevant and up to date).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couple of important lessons that will keep you in good stead for a long time:1. Learn how to learn well, continuously, and sustainably. Tech changes rapidly. And you will want to hop from one domain to another, just for keeping things interesting and to move with markets. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because you can start late and still be in the top percentile if you have the brains and work hard for it. It is a curse because you will be doing this no matter how many years of experience you have.2. Hone your non-technical skills– caution: these are compounding over time (both good and bad habits) – being disciplined, thinking clearly, articulating clearly, being professional, being trustworthy, managing your physical and mental health, being dependable/reliable, having a growth mindset, thriving in ambiguity and uncertainty etc. then, honing your communication skills – effectively  collaborating with people, give/receive effective feedback, do/get mentoring/coaching, working with cross-functional people, working with very seniors, very juniors, peers etc. read a lot, develop mental models, deeply craft your personal approach to first principles problem solving, to making tradeoffs/bets etc.You can do the above all by yourself, through reading, and observing people from afar, and engaging with people (even strangers on forum like this one) in dialog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so many red flags here&gt; fresh graduate data engineerto the company, they see this as "cheap labor"&gt; hired 6 months ago as a freelancebasically, they put you through the ringer without having to pay out benefits&gt; essentially functioning as a tech leada fresh out of college graduate is far from being qualified as "tech lead", you are out of depth here&gt;  with full responsibility and ownership of designing, implementing, and hiring for the projects I'm assignedbasically you are a 1-bus factor team. hope you have negotiated pay accordingly.&gt; Our company is not a tech company, so I only have a couple of tech-oriented colleaguesyou are a second class citizen at this company, your budget will be constrained, and be on the first to cut when it gets tough. In the O&amp;G industry, the boom and bust cycles are quite frequent.&gt; Now I directly report to the director of the companynow there's internal pressure to perform at a much higher level than your experience.If you want real advice, get the hell out of this company while you can. O&amp;G industry itself is notorious for back stabbing/conniving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42289955</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of user interface design in relation to maps, drawing inspiration from the anime "Ghost in the Shell." It discusses how the film presents advanced technological interfaces, emphasizing the importance of intuitive and immersive design. The author analyzes various elements of map interfaces, such as layering information and spatial representation, highlighting how these features can enhance user experience and interaction in both virtual and real-world environments. Ultimately, the piece reflects on the future possibilities of map UI design, suggesting that it should evolve to be more dynamic and user-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's this one GitS (SAC I think) UI thing that I think about pretty often: a bot needs to work faster so its fingers pop open revealing a huge number of additional cursed sub-fingers, such that it can type on a keyboard massively faster. I love thinking of this as such a wonderfully naive early 2000's view on HCI — there's no direct-access data API, the bot needs to use the keyboard so.... more actuators!! How much of technology has this same flavor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve always loved cyberpunk-style interfaces (and even have an inspiration folder on my computer for them) but sadly it doesn’t seem to be particularly popular style. I suppose because app designers are generally aiming to be as inoffensive and easily understandable as possible, which usually means a bland minimalism with some friendly corners.Whereas the various iterations of cyberpunk tend to be maximalist, use colors considered “outdated” (I’m thinking of that Matrix green so ubiquitous in the 90s-00s), or just too cold and machinic seeming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love UIs from Sci-fi films.Mamoru Oshii also made a live action film in 2001 called Avalon and in it the main character uses a terminal interface that I always thought was pretty cool. It's almost a classic monochrome terminal interface except there's no vertical scrolling when new data pushes away the old data. Old data goes backwards/behind on the z-index and blurs.You can see it here:https://youtu.be/m6NKhXlFU-s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42285676</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of linear types in Rust, specifically focusing on the "Use Once" strategy for managing resources safely and efficiently. It explains how linear types enforce rules that ensure variables are used exactly once, which can help prevent issues related to resource leaks and data races in concurrent programming. The author provides insights into the implementation of linear types in Rust, including examples and potential applications for game development and system programming, emphasizing the benefits of integrating linear type principles into Rust's ownership model.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem is that programming languages have always focused on the definition side of types, which is absolutely necessary and good, but the problem is that only limiting use by, e.g., "protected, private, friend, internal, ..." on class members, as well as the complicated ways we can limit inheritance, are barely useful.We need a way to define how to "use" the types we define. That definitional structure is going to bleed from creation of instances into how they live out their lifetimes. It appears that Rust's design addresses some aspects of this dimension, and it also appears to be a fairly major point of contention among y'all, or at least require a steepish learning curve. I don't know, as I prefer to work in ubiquitous environments that are already featureful on 5-10yo distros.One usage pattern many of us have found useful in our software for years is the "set once and only once" (singleton-ish) , whether it's for a static class member or a static function var, or even a db table's row(s). I don't know of any programming environment that facilitates properly specifying calculating something even that basic in the init phase of running the system, but I don't explore new languages so much anymore, none of them being mature enough to rely upon. Zig's comptime stuff looks promising, but I'm not ready to jump onto that boat just yet. I am, however, open to suggestions.The real solution will ultimately require a more "wholistic" (malapropism intended) approach to constraining all dimensions of our software systems while we are building them out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254737</guid></item><item><title>29. 1/0 = 0 (2018)</title><link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/divide-by-zero/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of dividing by zero in mathematics, explaining the common misconceptions and the implications it has in various mathematical contexts. It challenges the conventional understanding by exploring how dividing by zero can be viewed from different mathematical perspectives, such as limits in calculus and certain algebraic frameworks. The author emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between formal rules and practical applications, ultimately illustrating that while dividing by zero is often considered undefined, certain mathematical scenarios allow for a more nuanced interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, it's all good and nice that your types are sound and you don't have panics, but I feel like this could get you in trouble in the real world (gleam also uses this division convention, and people very much use gleam for "real world" things).  Suppose you took an average over an unintentionally empty list (maybe your streaming data source just didn't send anything over the last minute due to a backhoe hitting a fiber in your external data source's data center) and took some downstream action based off of what you think is the rolling average.  You could get royally fucked if money is involved.Crashing would have been preferable.1/0 = 0 is unsuitable and dangerous for anyone doing anything in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article invents a new binary operation, calls it "division" and uses the "/" operator to denote it. But the article repeats multiple times that this new operation isn't a multiplicative inverse, so it's not actually division. For example, (a/b)*b=a isn't true for this new operation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I debated this with my boss at my first programming job (this was 20+ years ago). He thought 1/0 should be 0 rather than an error because "that's what people expect". My argument was from mathematical definitions (the argument which this blog post picks apart).In retrospect, I see his point better - practical use trumps theory in most language design decisions.I haven't changed my mind but the reason has shifted more toward because "it's what a larger set of people expect in more situations" rather than mathematical purity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290069</guid></item><item><title>30.

The paper only contains that one line about the matter, in the "Participants" section. (also, do Norwegian university students in their early twenties normally write in cursive?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But this is not handwriting vs typing. It's handwriting vs. "a weird input method none of the participants had ever used before", namely pecking at the keyboard with one finger of one hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been taking notes in a text editor since 1994. What I found was that taking notes via computer was much easier because I could finally keep up with what I'm taking notes about (typing is MUCH faster than writing), and could therefore spend more time considering the thing I'm taking notes on, rearrange things, group them, etc using simple keyboard commands.My impression is that my retention went way up and I had better understanding overall because I could discover the underlying patterns quicker when I was spending less time and energy encoding my thoughts into words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288341</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn't waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, "I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....," which was code for "I want the night off."I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've never understood about menu design is the use of "market price" for certain items like crab and lobster.I understand that the prices of these items fluctuate due to various factors, but it discourages me from ordering them because I don't want to 1. ask the price (when you're with people you don't know well it brings attention to you possibly spending more than they would on the meal, and can make you come across as a bit overly focused on price/money - could be interpreted as rude or poor manners) 2. potentially say no based on the price and deal with related social vibes that might put off + come up with a backup on the menu 3. not ask for the price at all and be handed a surprisingly large bill. Some of the times I have asked, the waiter will have to physically leave to go check the price, which is also something I want to avoid.You might say something like "if you have to ask, you can't afford it" but I genuinely don't mind, and can easily afford, paying $50-70 on good seafood when I'm in the mood for it. Crab and lobster are some of my favorite foods, and their market price often comes in around there. So in the course of my life restaurants have probably lost out on hundreds or maybe a couple thousand in sales because of "market price". I'm not sure if this simply something most restarateurs are unaware of, it not being worth it to reprint menus or even put the market price on a blackboard somewhere, or some other psychological phenomenon I'm unaware of - maybe putting a larger price on the menu discourages most other people from ordering it or, makes other diners think the restaurant is "too expensive" even if not ordering it, or pisses diners off when they pay $X one week and come back and see it's at $X+20. Is there a canonical reason?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Allen says artificial intelligence and machine learning could transform this even further – algorithms could look at your previous choices when you last visited a restaurant and suggest other items you might like.“The restaurant industry has probably spent tens of billions of dollars over the years trying to understand menu design, menu engineering and psychology,” he says. “But the opportunities presented by the fourth industrial revolution are huge. Imagine being able to order a meal that has been designed to include your favourite foods with a single click.”Well, no, as the article suggests, AI will instead be used to direct diners to the most profitable menu item.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42268295</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;0) Metrics sure as heck aren’t the issue, because we already have metrics which tell us what to do. There are entire basic fields of economics, sociology and math which have told us how to order these industries to get better outcomes. Since the Scottish widows fund.1) Healthcare in the USA sucks because politics prevents you from remembering how insurance works. The most basic of basic financial calculations, the advantages of a large pool to absorb risk, vs smaller pools.2) Education has different reasons for being problematic, and it’s not just in the USA. The USA has only caught up to the problems in the rest of the developing world, having never had to content with these problems before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;"The way forward lies in open-source initiatives, crowdfunded projects, and collaborative efforts that prioritize human outcomes over institutional metrics."Is it me, or does it feel like developing software for BigCorp sucks for at least these reasons too?That said, there's also the Baumol cost disease: in certain service industries, productivity increases are difficult to make (or even measure, really). We've tried to automate teaching and healthcare (&amp;art!), but the results are mixed..https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have talked about it here a couple times before but my last couple doctors have generally spent more time typing than talking to me. They've become more stenographer than physician. I have lamented how the need for record keeping has seemingly interfered with actual … listening and empathy. They're just typing away on the computer, and I have even had one Google my symptoms and pull up WebMD.The new piece to this story and in stark contrast - my wife and I recently had a child and our pediatrician is genuinely fantastic. Friendly, helpful, and actively listens to our concerns. It frankly gives me hope that such physician-ing is still possible in today's system.I don't know what it's going to take to get us back to a reasonable place, but I am frankly kind of hopeful for like some sort of AI note taker so that the doctor could be the human in the room again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42286133</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's not apparent is how does the Markovian framework account for the apparent long-range dependencies and global coherence we observe in LLM outputs, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or maintaining context across many tokens? While the analysis elegantly explains local statistical patterns, it seems to conflict with transformer's ability to maintain attention across arbitrary distances... or am I missing something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper states a completely obvious tautology which is that if you limit the context length, a LLM has a finite state size!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And all real-world computers are also just finite state machines. But we obviously model computers as turing machines for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284980</guid></item><item><title>34.

The main difference appears to be vicinity‘s focus on simplicity while nearness tries to expose most of the functionality of the underlying backends.[1] https://github.com/davnn/nearness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does it mean that insertion is only supported for a few of the indexes?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling [unjustified futurist hype's] Growing Energy NeedsHaven't seen a case study yet where a company outside of spammers and scammers increased their productivity using LLMs to do any kind of classification or unstructured-data-to-structured-data translation.I've tried having it build up a table of contact information from email signatures, llama3 hallucinates phone numbers when the one I wanted was in the prompt, would have been better off with regex.Looking up film developer recipes with Perplexity Pro/GPT4o, the answer comes back with a confident 1:119 ratio of HC110 for my P33 film, when I click through the source it pulled those numbers from a completely different film stock, since naturally the forum thread drifted from discussing one brand to another midway through conversation and doesn't matter how big your context window is, LLMs cant keep associations straight.I'm going to keep trying to find uses for these garbage generators because the appearance of omniscience is so seductive, but I'm more cynical by the day, the investments and nuke fast tracking seems to be coming straight out of faith that AGI is just around the corner.(Yea yea I know, I'm holding it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems more than ridiculous that this is considered a serious issue. Datacenter space, generators (to cover the power needs of the datacenter) and power cost real money and thus there is plenty of incentive to reduce it.Already we are seeing both hardware alternatives and software optimizations; human ingenuity will eventually take care of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason people talk about this is because carbon credit trades are similar to minting shitcoins:- You have to create demand for something totally subjective like, "Does this reduce carbon emissions?"- There is a large liquid market for carbon credits.- You have to turn something nonfungible like various carbon sequestration technologies and schemes into something fungible like tons of CO2 emissions.- So you go and "mint" a "shitcoin," lets say literal chicken shit being processed "in a way" that makes it "make less carbon." Then some BS little certifying agency says that it does do that, whatever that means, and someone does some lab test once, that shows something, and then "AI Algorithms" are used to extrapolate the impact. Then you go to JP Morgan who needs various shitcoin-like things like this minted by people like you, and JP Morgan bundles it all up in a trade where Microsoft, who decided that they need to offset all datacenter emissions, will become the literal bagholder of chicken shit.Is there much of a difference between science trade journals speculating about so and so carbon reduction scheme and crypto trade journals speculating about so and so utility token? They are similar energies. I would love for there to be utility in the other side of the carbon credit schemes, but it looks like bullshit more often than not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42285133</guid></item><item><title>37.

That’s perfectly valid but it is artist’s statement stuff.What I didn’t see is any discussion about taking the fixed coordinate system defined by a printer’s volume and translating that into the larger space, which would presumably need to be mapped to 0.1 mm precision.  Or at least any previously printed objects would need to act as registration points at that level of precision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those who aren't familiar, poor first layer adhesion to the print surface is one of the most common causes of print failure in 3D printing. Typically you want a very clean build surface made of an appropriate material, and sometimes covered in glue stick or hairspray.I can imagine they went through a lot of false starts with this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People reading this may also like hexapod from (my goodness) 16+ years ago, which was a little robot cnc machinehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hEXwyJ2B78https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quN37YskoaM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235412</guid></item><item><title>39.

They're quite rare as children used to break them to obtain the marbles.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd-neck_bottle(I used to believe that the old term "codswallop" was derived from those bottles as you'd give them a wallop to dislodge the marble. However, it looks like Hancock's Half-Hour from 1959 is the first recorded usage of it which wouldn't fit with the usage of Codd bottles)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's an interesting hobby, but one that has recently been in the news in New Zealand for the wrong reasons where some bottle hunters dug up and destroyed some native trees looking for old bottles https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/535310/suspected-treasur...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A beautiful slice of Old Internet!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the limitations of conventional large language model (LLM) inference techniques in the context of developer AI applications. It emphasizes the need for a more tailored approach that accommodates the specific requirements of developers, such as the integration of better contextual understanding, improved performance on domain-specific tasks, and more efficient resource utilization. The author advocates for innovative solutions and methodologies to enhance LLMs, ultimately arguing that a rethinking of LLM architecture and inference strategies is essential to meet the evolving demands of developer-focused AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The academic literature has recently caught on to this approach as well and we want to highlight the excellent papers on Sarathi (link 1, link 2) and DeepSpeed-FastGen (link). The academic literature calls the technique “chunked prefill”.The Sarathi paper is more than a year old and implemented in both vllm and trtllm. There doesn't seem to be much else of substance in the article.
 Edit: to be fair it seems the article was written some time ago and only "updated" two weeks ago. So maybe it was more novel at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is great. Increased context does seem like the biggest current issue with copilot. It will take a lot of work to understand an entire code base but if we could get to understanding 2-5 files and how they interact... Coding assistants would be a lot more useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This product looks interesting but very expensive ($60 pm) compared to class leaders like Claude.Given that I think those alternatives are extremely cheap, that's not necessarily a problem - but it would be useful to understand more about how the results compare when the service is used in the real world, and what exactly is being provided - it seems to be saying this is a direct competitor to other LLMs enhanced with contextual magic, ie it doesn't sit on top of a third party LLM endpoint like, say, Cursor does.But if it is 3 times the price of services like Cursor or Claude or ChatGPT etc, it really needs to give evidence for that value in its outreach efforts, rather than just saying "this is how context makes things better".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42239323</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen a few articles on the Yotta/Synapse situation that focus on the people that have lost money while completely ignoring any of the prize-linked type of setup. The people are quoted as being told it was FDIC insured, it was a normal bank, etc. Then the articles describing the prize drawings started to surface.Was the prize-linked stuff part of the fine text or are people twisting the story as an attempt to lessen their shame? I don't trust any of the fintech apps at all, but I've never looked at any of their sites to see how blatant or how hidden their "oh yeah, we're not a real bank" details are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t really understand how the company that’s supposed to be holding your money vaporized 99.8% of it.  I watched that video, but I don’t really get it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weird that people are only focusing on whether or not the consumers justifiably lost their money.What about the blatant fraud? Yotta was being fradulent by saying their funds were FDIC insured, and I have a really hard time believing that synapse wasn't involved in fraud/embezzlement. Keeping records was their only job and they didn't do it at all.At the very minimum they told their customers (yotta ) they said they would keep track of the money and they didn't. That feels pretty clear to me.People don't "deserve" to be lied to. No one "deserves" to have their money stolen. That's the kind of thing rapists say about people they rape.AlsoFraud is bad. Technically not fraud doesn't buy you any good boy points, it just keeps you from losing lawsuits.Whether or not the consumers "should have known" is pretty irrelevant to whether or not people got scammed. But if that makes everyone feel better about the high amount of scaming that goes on in SV, then do what you are going to do./rant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288458</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the experience of running the Hurd operating system on a ThinkPad device, detailing the installation process, the challenges faced, and the performance outcomes. It highlights the unique features of Hurd, such as its microkernel architecture, and explains how it differs from more widely used operating systems. The author shares insights into the compatibility of Hurd with various hardware components of the ThinkPad, showcasing the progress and potential of free software projects like Hurd in providing an alternative computing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; After we resurrected the NetDDE build, and with kind help of the Hurd developers we finally managed to support NetDDE for the Hurd.. This allows the usage of the Intel 82573L Gigabit Ethernet Controller of the Thinkpad X60 (and many other network cards, possibly even WIFI). Instead of using the builtin kernel driver in GNU Mach, it would be running as a userland driver.&gt; What sparked this development was upstream's NetBSD rumpdisk support that would allow using modern hard disks such as SSDs, again running as a userland driver.Remarkable:) If that works out, it could quickly improve HURD's weakest point (hardware support) while still offering benefit over the kernel(s) drivers are borrowed from (drivers in user space).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is amazing! The Hurd may one day live.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243313</guid></item><item><title>46.

Nobody knew how to reprovision it and the company's internal documentation wasn't accurate so the server malingered around with its unnecessarily large 64GB memory pool.Just sayin'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone know why the instances lose 256MB RAM for every 4GB allocated?  3.75 (4), 7.5 (8), 15 (16), etc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290664</guid></item><item><title>47.

But with just a handful of semi fabs remaining and the most cutting edge chips in much higher demand, what is the market for these machines?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; the price would be “one digit less than ASML’s EUVs.”if thats true it will surely be a game changer, if not immediately surely in the medium term?geopolitics, oligopolies and oligopsonies notwithstanding, if a technology slices an order of magnitude it does change the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42286035</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the potential of Bitcoin reaching a value of $100,000 and highlights that El Salvador has accumulated $582 million in its state Bitcoin reserves. It emphasizes the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a financial asset and its significance for El Salvador's economy, especially after the country's early adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender. The piece outlines both the positive developments in Bitcoin's market performance and the implications for the Salvadoran economy.&lt;/p&gt;

What the rest of their state financial asset investments are isn't clear: they've been doing smart debt recycling getting rid of high interest overhangs of being a basket case economy.National exchequer isn't kitchen penny jar. I wouldn't personally invest in bitcoin because I don't like gambling and I'm content to live in an ETF world reflecting overall market trends, through my retirement fund. I wouldn't have a clue if they hold any and as long as it was a small % I wouldn't care much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wallet:https://platform.spotonchain.ai/en/profile?address=32ixEdVJW...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This represents less than 10% of annual government spending or revenue and less than 2% of their outstanding debt. It's cool, but not a huge deal at this point.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creator here - glad to see people like markwhen!Been working on markwhen for a few years now, originally inspired by cheeaun's life timeline that another commenter posted about.At this point markwhen is available as a VS Code extension, Obsidian plugin, CLI tool, and web editor in Meridiem.Some recent markwhen developments:- Dial, a fork of bolt.new (Stackblitz's very cool tool that leverages AI to help quickly scaffold web projects): an in-browser editor that lets you edit existing markwhen visualizations like the timeline or calendar or make your own. I just released that yesterday so it's still rough but I have big plans for it (it's one of the visualizations in meridiem)- Event properties: each entry can have it's own "frontmatter" in the form of `key: value` pairs. I wanted this as I'm aiming for more iCal interoperability in the future, so each event could theoretically have things like "attendees" or google calendar ids or other metadata. This was released in the last month or two.- remark.ing: this one isn't ready yet by any means but it's like a twitter/bluesky/mastodon-esque aggregated blog site. So you write markwhen and each entry is a post. In this way "scheduling" a post is just writing a future date next to it, and you have all your blog in one file. This one is a major WIP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is neat! It reminded me of this project by cheeaun that enables one to create a visual timeline based on a simple texted based format. The purpose was to plot one's life events in a visual way.https://github.com/cheeaun/lifeSample file (from the repository):    @USERNAME's life

https://bergie.iki.fi/blog/electronic-logbook/Right now I'm using YAML for the file format, as I wanted something that would be reasonably readable for both humans and machines.
Markwhen would also fit the bill nicely, so that's something to consider, at least as an export format.
My entries have a lot of properties, though (stuff like wind speed, vessel coordinates, barometer, etc). Traditional ship's logbooks were done in a tabular manner to record all this. So I'm not sure if that would end up looking quite messy.
Here is an example of a day of log entries in the current format:

&lt;p&gt;The article highlights key announcements and updates from Intel's CEO regarding the company's strategic direction and advancements in technology as of December 2024. It discusses Intel's commitment to innovation in semiconductor manufacturing, the evolution of its product lines, and initiatives to enhance the ecosystem for developers and partners. The CEO emphasizes the role of Intel in shaping the future of computing and the importance of sustainability in its operations, alongside plans for investments in research and development to maintain leadership in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.Intel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.What this likely means is two-fold:1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&amp;A but the board wants to do one or the other.If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked for 3 months for Intel. I can genuinely say that there is no saving that company. Recently, they are hiring many PhDs from various US universities (particularly Indians) to try to compensate (they offer generous stocks and are hiring like crazy right now). There are two major problems I saw: lack of genuine interest in fabs (most people are there for the Intel name and then leave or in the case of Indians, they are there for Visa purposes. Mind you, we were not allowed to hire people from China since Intel is subject to Export laws). The biggest problem by far is lack of talent. Most of the talent I know is either at Apple or Facebook/Google, including those trained in hardware. Intel is bound to crumble, so I hope we as taxpayers don't foot the bill. There was unwillingness to innovate and almost everyone wanted to maintain the status quo. This might work in traditional manufacturing (think tennis rackets, furniture...), but fabs must improve their lithography manufacturing nodes or they get eaten by the competition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult to see how this is anything other than a failure. I had high hopes when Gelsinger returned, but it seems that BK had done too much damage and Gelsinger didn't really get a grip on things. One of the things I heard that really highlighted the failure of this recovery was that BK had let Intel balloon in all sorts of ways that needed to be pared back and refocused, but head count under Gelsinger didn't just stay static but continued to significantly grow. It's no good giving the same politically poisonous, under-delivering middle management more and more resources to fail at the same job. They really need to clear house in a spectacular way but I'm not sure who could even do that at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42296067</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article argues that using Ruby on Rails as a low-code framework offers greater advantages compared to traditional low-code platforms. It emphasizes that Rails provides more flexibility, customization, and control over the development process, enabling developers to create robust applications efficiently. The author highlights key features of Rails, such as its convention over configuration philosophy and strong community support, which enhance productivity and streamline application development, making it a powerful choice for both experienced developers and those seeking low-code solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253735"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low code initially works quite well until you hit the limits of the low-code framework. If you just need a throw-away proof of concept, or a personal utility, or the like, low-code solutions can be quite efficient.However, implementing anything significant that's expected to be extended and improved, particularly when there are users that request changes, improvements and new features, low-code "is like climbing a tree in order to reach the moon". You'll  will very quickly run out of tree and further progress becomes almost impossible.To a lesser extent the same thing also occurs with web development frameworks, but the limits are less constraining and there are often mechanisms that allow you integrate your own code, that implements whatever it is that the framework doesn't provide.Low code, frameworks, and "build it totally from scratch", can all be a valid solutions, but the right choice often depends on a bunch of specific  considerations (technology, user &amp; quality expectations, organizational capabilities &amp; constraints, etc.)My recommendation is to keep an open mind about alternative technologies and approaches, and to pick solutions that are appropriate for the environment in which they will be developed, extended and operated. And that requires experience, which you normally don't have in the early phase of your career (e.g. good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never understood the "low code" microbubble that was being inflated.We went through that era already. We called them RAD tools, and they targeted the same sort of strange, mythical end user profile. Someone so technically capable and apt that they could navigate a dizzying domain of deeply buried checkboxes, property fields, and sprawling relationships &amp; side-effects, but who was also simultaneously unable to understand source code or program structure.When using them you would quickly hit a point where making changes to relatively simple things would take mounting an archeological dig of GUI controls that would have otherwise been a few simple find &amp; replace operations on code in a regular environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post boils down to "it's easier to use something you know in and out that some new tool you're using for the first time.", so not a good argument. I think I've seen ruby code a handful of times in my life and it looks like an obfuscated form of perl to me. If you'd give me a low code tool and ruby and the same task I don't think I'll succeed with either in a reasonable amount of time.(Not that I'm a fan of low code or anything.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253735</guid></item><item><title>4.

Each segment cuts at just the right point to make you think you’d be able continue exploring these vast worlds, but in practice you can only walk a couple os steps before hitting an invisible wall, which becomes more frustrating than not being able to move at all. It feels like being trapped in a box. My reaction went from impressed to disappointed fast.I get these are early steps, but they oversold it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When watching 3D movies with a VR headset you have to keep your head perfectly still or the lack of parallax destroys the 3D illusion. Compare to a 3D game where moving your head actually lets you move through space and actually look around objects.Something like this applied to every frame of the movie would allow you to move around a little and preserve the perspective shifts. The limitation that you can only move about 4 feet in any direction would not matter for this use case.Of course this comes at the expense of the director and cinematographer's intention, which is no small thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People complaining that it's a small area, lol my man, this is fucking insane, i know AI is starting to get normalized, but they converted an image into a 3d world! even if its 1ft/1ft its still amazing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42297644</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The page provides a comprehensive overview of the "Probability Theory" course offered at the University of Houston, detailing its objectives, syllabus, and resources. It outlines key concepts that will be covered, such as probability measures, random variables, and statistical inference, while emphasizing the importance of understanding both theoretical and applied aspects of probability. Additionally, the site includes information on assignments, grading policies, and recommended textbooks to support students in their learning journey.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PhD in math here with several published papers. And my recommendation is a metaprinciple: enjoy mathematics. Benjamin Finegold said similarly that the secret to chess is to enjoy every move. Personally, I had no trouble in mathematics, ever. And I think the reason for that is that I really enjoy just doing it, writing symbols down, learning about new theories, and even inventing my own.Not everyone will enjoy mathematics at first sight. But I think at least 50% of that can be explained by the lack of obvious paths to enjoy mathematics. Obviously, most mathematics taught in high-school is not taught as it should be: a cool artistic logical pursuit that has all kinds of fun in it.So my advice is to really find a mentor who already has found that path and let them show you how to enjoy math.Believe me, I've tutored a lot of people, many of which initially disliked math and found it difficult. But after a few tutoring sessions, I could see a little sparkle in their eye that said, "hey, this might be cool".So before you apply logic, studying, and other tedious "productivity" measures to your math learning, make sure you find a way to enjoy it first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My secret sauce as an undergraduate for all my math courses was solving problems. Solve all the problems at the end of the chapters in the textbook. Find other textbooks in the library and solve all the problems at the end of their chapters.In graduate school that was expanded: take every chapter of the textbook and rewrite it, filling in all the intermediate steps of every proof, those where the author writes "it follows that ..." or "from which it's obvious that ..."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first thing you have to get used to when moving from school to uni is being utterly lost and defeated.At the end of high school, I could do everything. I finished my IB exams with huge amount of time to spare, the only thing holding me back was being able to write fast enough. It had been months since I saw a regular curriculum question that I didn't know how to do. Any marks I lost were just trivial errors.When I got to university, there would be question sheets where I would look at the questions and wonder what it had to do with the lectures I had just been in. As in "I went to this lecture, and I'm supposed to use the information to answer these questions, but I don't even know what the questions mean".The learning happens when you are doing this frustrating head-bashing.You read, you read more, you fill a notebook with useless derivations, and eventually you things start to take shape. This could take the entire week's worth of time, just sitting there fumbling about.The difference is that in uni, the amount of material is so vast you cannot explain it to someone in the time that you have. The students have to pick up some key ideas, and then fill in all the details themselves by pouring hours into it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290996</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ha! Oh my, this is exactly what I am studying. MC1R is a G-Protein Coupled receptor (GOPCR) and the ARHGAP36 gene/enzyme is a GTPase activator for the Rho-type GTPases by converting them to an inactive GDP-bound state. Meaning it breaks down GTP (Guanosine Triphosphate is responsible for providing energy to the receptor.)If there is too little or too much GTP it will effect the sensitivity of the MC1 Receptor and will change the color of the hair accordingly. BTW, humans have these same genes so the same will apply to humans.I am studying these GPCRs and how they play a role in Mood and Chronic Illness like Long COVID and ME/CFS. Too little GTP and all of the 850+ G-Protein Coupled receptor  will be effected. These include Serotonin, Dopamine, and Epinepherine Receptors.You can see the whole list of them here:
https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ReceptorFamiliesFor...I has an enzyme deficiency (PNP) that makes me have way too much GTP and it has me disabled but getting better after this discovery I made about Receptor Energy.I too much GTP also leads to grey hair.Also, GLP1 is a GPCR!This might have been the most serendipitous or God given thing for me to read today because I have been pretty suicidal and thinking I was wrong about my idea, but this literally is another piece I can put in my paper that proves that if the serotonin receptor does not have enough GTP, it does not matter how much serotonin you have, you will not get cellular activation via cAMP.Adding here that cats had more Arghap36 RNA in orange regions. More Arghap36 means less GTP. Less GTP means less energy for the MC1R receptor which means less black/brown pigment is produced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;humans share the vast majority of our genes with other mammals; are a cat's genes for fur the same genes humans have for body hair? does this orange gene for cats bear any resemblance to ginger genes in humans?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's no such thing as a "gene for a trait". Just because some gene perfectly correlates with some trait doesn't mean that's all the gene does. There will be 1000s of things that gene does, and merely one of them just happens to be hair color.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291386</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges faced by Kenya's coffee industry, highlighting the decline in quality and production that threatens the country’s reputation for producing some of the world’s best coffee. Factors contributing to this decline include aging coffee trees, climate change, and outdated farming practices, along with the increased costs of production and competition from other coffee-producing nations. The author emphasizes the need for innovation, investment in farmer education, and government support to revitalize Kenya's coffee sector and restore its prestigious status in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing up in Nairobi, it took only a 20-minute ride to visit the vast coffee farms in areas like Kiambu, Limuru, and others nearby areas. These farms were located less than 10 kilometers from the city center, many of them close to the edge of the Aberdare mountain ranges. In the mid-1990s, when I was in primary school, we were taught that Kenya was a leader in coffee and tea production, and I used to consume coffee almost daily.
Then, all of a sudden, it seemed like one scandal after another emerged—farmers were not being paid, and the industry became overrun by brokers and middlemen. This meant local farmers were cut off from selling their coffee at competitive market rates and instead had to deal with corrupt government officials and brokers.
So, what did the farmers do? Most abandoned coffee farming and converted their farms into prime real estate. Remember, these farms were near the mountain slopes, making the land highly valuable. These new houses became popular with the UN and foreign nationals from Europe and the US, who sought refuge from Nairobi’s “heat.”
As a result, more coffee farms were converted into real estate, and today these areas feature some of the most expensive properties in Kenya. For instance, $200,000 would now be considered cheap for a three-bedroom apartment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was such a fascinating read—it really resonated with me. A few years ago, my girlfriend and I started a small coffee shop in Hanoi as a fun side project, and I was struck by the parallels between Vietnam's coffee history and the issues you outline here about Kenya.Vietnam, like Kenya, emerged from a coffee industry shaped by colonial-era inequities. Yet through reforms, robust state support for smallholder farmers, and a focus on infrastructure, Vietnam has positioned itself as a global coffee powerhouse. While the initial focus on robusta was quantity-driven, there’s now a shift toward quality, which is helping Vietnamese coffee expand into new markets.Kenya’s situation feels similar yet distinct. It has an unparalleled coffee heritage, and with thoughtful reforms—empowering smallholders, encouraging direct trade, and finding the right balance between quality and disease-resistant hybrids—it could reclaim its standing on the global stage.The article beautifully captures the systemic challenges and the hope for transformation. I really believe Kenya’s coffee can rise again, stronger and fairer, just as Vietnam is starting to do. It’s inspiring to see how coffee connects people and places across the world in such unique ways!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Wendelboe (perhaps the greatest coffee roaster) has been talking about this on his latest Q&amp;A podcast. A rigmarole for exports plus climate change are causing issues.He does a two-episode deep dive into the Kenyan coffee market here, which is worth a listen: https://timwendelboe.no/2024/03/inside-kenyas-coffee-market-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42296287</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up Kubernetes on Hetzner Cloud, detailing the necessary steps and configurations required for a successful deployment. It begins with an overview of Kubernetes and Hetzner's offerings, followed by a step-by-step process that includes creating a cloud server, installing required software, and configuring Kubernetes clusters. The article also touches on best practices and troubleshooting tips to help users effectively manage their Kubernetes environment on Hetzner. Overall, it serves as a practical resource for developers looking to utilize Hetzner for their container orchestration needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288956"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've [1] been using Hetzner's dedicated servers to provide Kubernetes clusters to our clients for a few years now. The performance is certainly excellent, we typically see request times half. And because the hardware is cheaper we can provide dedicated DevOps engineering time to each client. There are some caveats though:1) A staging cluster for testing updates is really a must. YOLO-ing prod updates on a Sunday is no one's idea of fun.2) Application level replication is king, followed by block-level replication (we use OpenEBS/Mayastor). After going through all the Postgres operators we found StackGres to (currently) be the best.3) The Ansible playbooks are your assets. Once you have them down and well-commented for a given service then re-deploying that service in other cases (or again in the future) becomes straightforward.4) If you can I'd recommend a dedicated 10G network to connect your servers. 1G just isn't quite enough when it comes to the combined load of prod traffic, plus image pulls, plus inter-service traffic. This also gives a 10x latency improvement over AWS intra-az.5) If you want network redundancy you can create a 1G vSwitch (VLAN) on the 1G ports for internal use. Give each server a loopback IP, then use BGP to distribute routes (bird).6) MinIO clusters (via the operator) are not that tricky to operate as long as you follow the well trodden path. This provides you with local high-bandwidth, low-latency object storage.7) The initial investment to do this does take time. I'd put it at 2-4 months of undistracted skilled engineering time.8) You can still push ancillary/annoying tasks off onto cloud providers (personally I'm a fan of CloudFlare for HTTP load balancing).[1]: https://lithus.eu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have experience running Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner dedicated servers, as well as working with a range of fully or highly managed services like Aurora, S3, and ECS Fargate.From my experience, the cloud bill on Hetzner can sometimes be as low as 20% of an equivalent AWS bill. However, this cost advantage comes with significant trade-offs.On Kubernetes with Hetzner, we managed a Ceph cluster using NVMe storage, MariaDB operators, Cilium for networking, and ArgoCD for deploying Helm charts. We had to handle Kubernetes cluster updates ourselves, which included facing a complete cluster failure at one point. We also encountered various bugs in both Kubernetes and Ceph, many of which were documented in GitHub issues and Ceph trackers. The list of tasks to manage and monitor was endless. Depending on the number of workloads and the overall complexity of the environment, maintaining such a setup can quickly become a full-time job for a DevOps team.In contrast, using AWS or other major cloud providers allows for a more hands-off setup. With managed services, maintenance often requires significantly less effort, reducing the operational burden on your team.In essence, with AWS, your DevOps workload is reduced by a significant factor, while on Hetzner, your cloud bill is significantly lower.Determining which option is more cost-effective requires a thorough TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) analysis. While Hetzner may seem cheaper upfront, the additional hours required for DevOps work can offset those savings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I used to do my own car maintenance, because I wanted to save money, and it was fun. It turned out it was more complex than I thought, things slowly fell apart or broke. I spent a good deal of time "re-fixing" things. Spent probably thousands on tools over the years, partly replacing the cheap stuff that broke or rusted quickly. My cars were often up on blocks. But I learned a lot of great lessons. The biggest one? Some things are not worth DIYing; pay a mechanic or lease your car, especially if you depend on it for your livelihood.Even something as simple as an oil change, really isn't worth doing yourself. First you buy the tools (oil drip pan, filter wrench, funnel, creeper). Then you set aside the time to use them, find your dingy work clothes. You go to the store and buy new oil and a filter. You go home and change the oil. Then that day or another day you go to a store that will take your used oil. Versus 20 minutes at an auto mechanic, for about $15 more than the cost of the oil and filter.Kubernetes is an entire car (and a complex one). It's really not worth doing the maintenance yourself, I promise you. Unless you're just doing it for fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288956</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the concept of a "brain microbiome," referencing research that has uncovered a microbial population in the brains of fish, which may play a role in their behavior and cognitive functions. It discusses how these findings could suggest the possibility of a similar microbiome in humans, influencing their mental health and neurological processes. The research highlights the interconnectedness of the gut microbiome and brain function, raising questions about the implications for understanding human brain health and potential therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Matthew Olm (opens a new tab), a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is “inherently skeptical” of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. “This is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,” he said. “And so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.”It's interesting to me that it would ever have been considered outlandish. In light of everything we now know about microbiomes and microbiology in general, it seems to me as a layman that the more radical proposition would be that the blood-brain barrier would be 100% effective at keeping out all bacteria, rather than the proposition that it probably isn't but that the bacteria it does let in tend to be symbiotic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few years ago my team mounted what I think was the largest-(to-date) scale search for this in electron microscopy brain tissue volumes [1].I STRONGLY believe there is a substantial central nervous system microbiome, but (spoiler alert) no evidence found in that search :)If you're excited about this work, the datasets are all freely available from BossDB [2] — well over a dozen petavoxels of it!

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and introduction of the famous "sudo" warning message in Unix-like systems, specifically in the context of its development and the reasons behind it. It examines when the warning was first implemented, the background of its creation, and the individuals involved. The discussion highlights the significance of the warning in promoting security and responsible usage of the sudo command, which allows users to execute commands with superuser privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the 90s we were told ostentatiously to include "unauthorised access is not permitted" to the login prompt.Why? Because the login prompt said "please login:" and this was being read by some bush lawyer as an invitation to connect, and therefore would impede a case if we had a hacker login with a stolen password.I think it was founded on urban myth, but I assure you this is what we were told to do: add text to make it plain, the invitation was to legitemate users only.I felt the sudo warning was in the same spirit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's interesting how messages gets their own life.I was building a user-impersonation system, and it allowed a power-admin to login as another user to change their settings and to help them.When you signed in as the user it said:&gt; You are now signed in as User\##{user_id}, behave nicely ;-)and when you switched back to your admin it said:&gt; You are now signed back in as Admin\##{admin_id}, wreak havoc! ;-)I met with a former colleague years later, and he still referred to the wreak havoc message that I didn't think about for more than 10 seconds, but I had installed that in his brain and it lived there as a memory of that company and that system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a funny artifact because most people today use, and have only used Linux in a “single user” context.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s funny that the CCP Boot lickers are here to flag comments that are critical of the CCP when this is literally fabricating history to make China look good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Studied ancient Chinese history but not a silk expert, here's my 2c.Critical background is that silk takes a lot of labour to prepare. First you must have the right kind of insects (various species of moth in the larval stage are commonly known as "silkworm"), then you must have the right kind of trees to feed them (commonly mulberries), then you add a lot of labour for capture, harvesting, spinning, dyeing, weaving. In modern times I have only really seen it prepared commercial scale in Jiangsu province (near Xuzhou). If you head too far north the insects probably suffer from the cold, and if you head too far south any artificial farming monoculture is probably readily outcompeted by other flowering plants and predatory insects which are more suited to the tropics (on account of higher moisture, food availability and temperature).Relative to existing fabrics such as hemp, silk has at least in other contexts been of value militarily because of its relative strength to weight ratio and dense weave when applied to important tasks such as resisting arrows, although I'm uncertain if this use had emerged yet. Any military use would tend to reinforce a cultural link between life and death owing to its spatiotemporal proximity to mortality events.The fact that it is soft and labour-intensive (expensive / in short supply) means it was probably reserved for the wealthier or higher ranking figures.Although the paper doesn't state it clearly, it actually deals with the archaeological findings of a non-Han Chinese civilization in the area of Sichuan which was illiterate and was based around what appeared to be a bird and tree cult (the Shu kingdom of the Sichuan basin[1]). It is therefore possible that a kind of soft, reflective-refractive, feather-like, readily dyed textile with a fine weave may have contributed to some sort of ritual purpose in line with these beliefs. Later this civilization was destroyed by the Han Chinese.The wicking properties of silk are fair (I was unable to find a quantitative reference) as was the major early textile of hemp (which is also tough and therefore long-lasting) which is significant as we know that Sichuan in the Shu kingdom period was a vast, tropical inland basin criss-crossed by regularly flooding rivers descending from the Himalayas, thickly forested and with crocodiles, elephants, rhinos, giant cats, colourful birds, etc. Both silk and hemp textiles would help to cool anyone wearing them, relative to other options (animal skins, etc.). Furthermore, in the absence of modern medicine, fine-weave capable wicking fabrics would assist with resisting potentially lethal bacterial and fungal infections in the tropical environment and may therefore have been used as wound dressings or undergarments.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(kingdom)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even early piratical man - ranging from the seafaring Athenians to Han Chinese - who developed extensive seafaring capabilities utilized these materials in peace and in war. Thus, the Chinese idiom "turning war into jade and silk" is a means of communication with the gates of heaven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42297733</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of these smaller model paradigm suggests that we need to incorporate pruning into model training. Neat was one of my favorite algorithms of all time. Same thing with BitNet models which keep showing the information you need is not that much for neural networks. And again, it is same with us, we use much less energy than a regular network so there seems to be immense waste of energy training these models.My intiution tells me the pre-training paradigm will shift immensely in near future because we started to understand that we don’t need all these paramaters since the subnetworks seems to be very robust preserving information in high dimensions. We keep saying curse of dimensionality but it is more like the bliss of dimensionality we keep seeing. Network redundancy still seems to be very high given BitNet is more less comparable to other LLMs.This basically shows over 50% of the neural net is gibberish! The reason being is that the objective function simply does not include it.Again my intiution tells me that neural scaling laws are incomplete as they are because they lack the efficiency parameter that needs to be taken into account (or simply left out due to greed of corporate).And this is what we are seeing as “the wall”.I am no expert in neural network theory nor in math but I would assume the laws should be something in the vicinity of this formulation/simulation:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xkTMU2v1I-EHFAjoS86...and encapsulate shannon’s channel’s capacity. I call them generalized scaling laws since it includes what it should include in the first place: entropy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After reading the article it seems to me that this is more like synaptic pruning where weak connections between neurons are eliminated in order to increase the efficiency of the neurons. Interesting to see that this also works for LLMs.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I might be missing something, but it would be great if the charts would show inference speed, model size (required VRAM) and quality (benchmark results) in one. It might be that the same quality and speed and size can be attained by just quantizing, perhaps with added fine-tuning, without the sparseness. The post seems to imply that their method is better, but if that's the case, they could show that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42250773</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;I am unable to access external links directly, including Google Drive files. However, if you can provide me with the text or the main points from the document, I would be happy to help you summarize it!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I kind of like Root's approach, just make three separate rulebooks. One quickstart guide, one "normal" rulebook, and one "law" type rulebook laying out everything in almost procedural style with clear and consistent definitions etc. Many games could benefit from that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recall my favorite part of opening up a new Nintendo game was poring over the manual. I didn't actually want it for instructions. It was the lore and the pictures and the dreams of what I could do with the game that made it fun.Now, people are so media saturated that they're begging to remove as much content as possible in order to just get the clearest bit of information. I can't help we've lost something in society when we're not really enjoying or having fun unless we get immediate and overwhelming pleasure triggers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an avid board gamer, I think one of the biggest factors is page count. A big rule book makes the game feel less approachable. In the example provided at the bottom, the rewritten rulebook is ~50 pages. The original is 24. It doesn't matter how well it's written if it scares people off.I find that many people are so afraid of reading game rules that they'd rather watch 15-30m how to play videos. It's telling of the industry that these videos are typically better learning resources than the rulebooks themselves.My favorite rulebooks have 1-page rule references at the back or scannable columns on each page that summarize the main text.As someone who enjoys technical documentation writing, I think board game rulebook writing would be a rewarding experience. Not exactly sure how to get into that field though...(I have yet to read this in full, but I'm excited to dig in)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42297252</guid></item><item><title>15.

In a system where every niche is filled with more advanced life looking for a next meal, even if a new form of life got started, it would not last long.There are a number of related issues regarding life, including LUCA and the emergence of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, which suggest to me less that a single ancestor existed at that time than that that ancestor's descendents out-competed (or out-lucked) all other comers, and that once established other contenders for life simply couldn't find an available niche.Oh, and bad news for the fans of LGM / panspermia, at least in the "absence of evidence" sense:Population statistics indicate that the microorganisms originated from terrestrial contamination during the sample preparation stage rather than being indigenous to the asteroid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42220580</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;Steel Browser is an open-source web browser developed to enhance privacy and security while providing a user-friendly experience. It is built on modern web standards and emphasizes fast performance, with features such as ad-blocking, tracking protection, and a customizable interface. The project is aimed at developers and users who value transparency, with an active community contributing to its ongoing improvement and documentation available for those looking to understand or contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very interesting.  I worry that if I use your cloud, and a lot of other people do, all of your IP addresses will get banned by all the big players.  It will definitely be a fun cat and mouse game!Related story:  Way back in the day, PayPal was just getting started, and decided eBay transactions would be their perfect customer.  The only problem is that eBay didn't allow scraping.  So they built an entire proxy infrastructure to go around eBay's rules and scrape them.It worked.  It worked so well, eBay bought PayPal.The side effect of this is that I got control of the PayPal proxy infrastructure since I was on the security team for both eBay and PayPal after the acquisition.We used that proxy farm to scrape the rest of the web looking for fake eBay sites (because they would block traffic from eBay's IPs) and we had the guys who built it help us build proxy defense for eBay and PayPal.So this could work in your favor, if you manage to constantly scrape a large target who might want to buy you. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello Hacker News! We’re Nas and Huss, co-founders of steel.dev (http://steel.dev). Steel is an open-source browser API for AI agents and apps. We make it easy for AI devs to build browser automation into their products without getting flagged as a bot or worrying about browser infra.over the last year or so, we’ve built quite a few AI apps that interact with the web and noticed - a. it was magical when you could get an llm to use the web and it worked and b. our browser infra was the source of 80% of our development time. Maintaining our browser infrastructure became its own engineering challenge - keeping browser pools healthy, managing session states and cookies, rotating proxies, handling CAPTCHA solving, and ensuring clean process termination. We got really good at running browser infrastructure at scale, but maintaining it was still stealing time away from building our actual products. So we wanted to build the product we wish we had.Steel allows you to run any automation logic on our hosted instances of chromium. When you start a dedicated browser session you get stealth, proxies, and captcha solving out of the box. We do this by exposing websocket and http endpoints so you can connect to these instances with puppeteer, playwright, selenium(in beta), or raw CDP commands if you’re built like that.Behind the scenes, we host several browser instances and route incoming connection requests to one of these instances. Our core design principle was to allow for every session to have its own dedicated browser instance + resources (currently 2gb vram and 2gb vcpu) while still allowing for quick session creation/connection times. Our first thought was to have separate nodes running in a Kubernetes cluster, but the cost of hosting warm browser instances would be expensive (which would be reflected in the pricing), and the boot times would be too slow to handle the scale that some customers required. We got around this by deploying our browser instance image on a firecracker VM, taking advantage of the lightning-fast boot times and ability to share a root FS.Today, we’re open-sourcing the code for the steel browser instance, with plans to open-source the orchestration layer soon. With the open-source repo, you get backwards compatibility with our node/python SDKs, a lighter version of our session viewer, and most of the features that come with Steel Cloud. You can run this locally to test Steel out at an individual session level or one-click deploy to render/railway to run remotely.We're really happy we get to show this to you all, thank you for reading about it! Please let us know your thoughts and questions in the comments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this very different from https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245573</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides comprehensive documentation for the CTP (Course, Teaching, and Projects) framework within the Racket programming language. It serves as a resource for educators and learners, outlining the framework's features, usage, and applications in teaching programming concepts. The documentation includes tutorials, examples, and explanations of key components, aiming to facilitate effective learning and teaching experiences through the Racket environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm seeing a lot of commentary that basically complains that category theory isn't useful. Like most topics in programming, it's useful for some things and not others, so YMMV. The parts of the programming discipline that are truly useful to all programmers are pretty much all learned at the beginning of one's career, or are really difficult to teach and must be learned by participating over time. The fact that you haven't found something useful doesn't mean it's useless in general, since it could just be too specialized to apply to your domain.As a professional programmer, I personally can say that I have found category theory to be at least occasionally useful in my work, and for me it was worth knowing for that. But I've also studied a lot of math, so it wasn't a big leap out of my comfort zone to learn about it. Like I said, YMMV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a phony work in progress (I do not mean to disparage the author, just the work itself, or perhaps the YC submission). There's no direction, it's just "let's do it because ... ?" Here is the authors' answer to "Why Category theory?":&gt;The answer lies in the abstraction and generalization capabilities provided by category theory. It allows us to see beyond the specifics of a particular programming language, problem, or system, revealing the underlying structures that are common across different domainsRest assured you will not find much of that by reading category theory (CT). This type of studying of CT reminds me of Shaolin monks trying to fight boxers (hint: the boxer wins).Another peculiar thing about these notes is that the author colored every CT diagram (and worse even, there is no logic to the color choices, it's just randomized.)CT is a nice subject as any other, and useful to those doing research. You don't need it if you're not doing specific math/CS research that uses it. Anything that could be useful to you from CT can be explained in one afternoon over some coffee or beer. For example, the notion of universality could be useful to many programmers: the "most general" object of its kind, and how that is reflected in relation to other objects of its kind; a brief example would be that the "free" language of all strings in the letters A and B is universal amongst all languages of strings A, B with relations, (relations such as AAAB = A.)Don't enter turbulent waters if you're not a swimmer! Maybe you can take a boat instead. For those who already know CT because of other motivations (in particular, because they're mathematicians who have spent many years studying mathematics), the applications of CT to computer science can come somewhat naturally, but for others, it's an uphill battle and a waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The section on "Mapping Category to Programming" seems to totally miss the point of how category theory is actually relevant in programming. Functors, applicatives, and monads are category theory concepts that are particularly useful in programming, but they aren't even mentioned here.Category theory is way more abstract than programming, so
the truth is that you don't need to know what these concepts mean in category theory; just understand them as programming concepts to start with.  For example, monoids are ubiquitous in programming, but the category theory view of a monoid as a one-object category is too abstract to be helpful. Instead, it's much more useful to just think of a monoid as a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Then you can easily see that strings, list, and numbers (with their applicable operations) are all monoids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291141</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Martha Wells' "Murderbot" series, which follows a logging and security android equipped with human emotions and a desire for autonomy. The narrative explores themes of identity, free will, and the nature of humanity through the perspective of an AI that prefers binge-watching soap operas over its violent programming. Wells discusses her creative process and the significance of the character's struggle for self-acceptance amidst action and adventure, highlighting the blend of science fiction with deeply personal storytelling. The series has garnered critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base, reflecting broader discussions about tech and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

The tech side of things are believable enough (at least compared to the usual handwavy nature of sci-fi books) and now I understand why, as it seems Wells has a history in IT!I'm struggling to not gush about this book and trying to avoid spoilers, but if you like a good sci-fi action/adventure book with a strong lean towards a journey of self discover it's really worth a read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit mystified by the hype for murderbot. I read it and thought it was OK but a lot of people rave about it.Still not every book is for every person, it didn't connect with me but it very obviously has its fans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This series reminded me about my favorite HFY short story of all time: ABBY514https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/c0ojkr/oc_abby514/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42254888</guid></item><item><title>19.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.Trivial / unchallenging is not the problem, in my opinion.  Sometimes it's good to relax and give yourself a break.  Staring at the wall and letting your mind wander is trivial and unchallenging, but it's not going to rot your brain.The problem is overstimulating shortform content that wrecks your attention span.But I don't believe super-longform content is necessarily the solution, either.  If you force yourself to think about the same thing for too long, it effectively becomes work, and generates the same sort of mental fatigue.  That's sort of pointless if you're trying to relax and recover.I think it's best to aim for a sweet spot of "unchallenging and also understimulating".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I crazy or should it be "brainrot" (no space)? I'm actually not bothered by the idea of word of the year having spaces, I just thought this particular term had no space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm glad to see this word getting wider exposure. I hope people will expand it's use to describe all kinds of content beyond the narrow/extreme aesthetic it refers to in short form video. Once you start looking, you recognize brainrot content everywhere: daytime TV, talk radio, reality TV, cable news, Facebook AI slop, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42292294</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the discovery of early letters found in a newly unearthed scroll from Herculaneum, which was buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Researchers are utilizing advanced imaging technology to read the charred text, revealing insights into the content and significance of the scrolls. The text is thought to contain philosophical ideas, potentially linked to the works of Epicurus. The article emphasizes the importance of these findings in understanding ancient literature and the preservation of historical texts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The autosegmentation jumps frequently between adjacent sheets, so is not yet precise enough to reveal contiguous texts, but it coarsely follows the entire scroll.Maybe a stupid idea, but has anyone tried to make a new scroll with known content and markers/known coordinates, and then cook it so as to bring it to a state close to the ones we're trying to unroll. And then scan it, and use that to fine-tune the software?There are probably simple insights that are extremely difficult to discover when looking at an entirely new problem, that would become more obvious when one already knows the original inside out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given this is a join over image analysis, text recognition, data science and a huge complex 3D analytical model of scans which has to be mapped to the surface states, unrolled, and then subjected to edge and other discrimination, I think the application of ML and other novel techniques is great.The potential for applying lessons learned to other problems in complex surface/manifold scanning, "reading" states from disparate imaging systems, it's got big upsides.I'm not particularly sure anyone is claiming this is an LLM demonstrator or proves AGI is coming so if you permit me to float a strawman: it isn't.It's great science. Very impressive work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glad to see there are more developments in the Vesuvius challenge - it has been one of the most interesting things I've discovered on HN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42257040</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Xenomorphia Ex Machina: The Zoology and Biochemistry of Xenomorphs from the Alien Franchise" explores the fictional biology and biochemical properties of Xenomorphs, the iconic creatures from the "Alien" franchise. It delves into their anatomical features, life cycle, and adaptability, drawing parallels with real-world biology to understand how these extraterrestrial beings function in their environments. The piece aims to provide an analytical perspective on the scientific plausibility of Xenomorph traits and behaviors, inviting readers to consider the intersection of science fiction and zoology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignoring the content of the paper, could someone comment on this referencing style:    Thus, the seed of the xenomorph, the “black goo” (Chemical A0-3959X.91–15)

What does "Chemical" refers to here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should we gather the "just to clear it up" statements all in one place?"Xenomorph" is not any sort of official in-universe term for these things, though I believe Alien: Romulus at least does have scientists calling it "xenomorph &lt;some number&gt;" indicating it has been catalogued. Xenomorph is just a generic term for a non-humanoid alien, though, what PFC Hudson called a "bug" when the term was introduced as Lt Gorman was briefing the other Marines about what they might expect. This wasn't their first time encountering hostile life and they called a lot of it by this name.The xenomorphs (as fans have taking to calling it) are not silicon-based, but rather some blend of organic and inorganic. They're bioengineered superweapons, not naturally occurring. As far as we can tell, they don't eat at all, at least in their adult form, as they grow to full size in a matter of hours without us ever seeing them consume anything. They only seem to need hosts in their larval form. This is also why they mostly don't kill the humans they attack unless they have to because they're under threat. They instead attach them to a resin they secrete, where they are used as incubators for more larval forms. Their entire purpose seems to boil down to multiplying as rapidly as possible. I believe Ridley Scott has suggested they consume electricity or radiation in general directly, rather than extracting energy from food.They were not actually created by the "engineers," as Shaw from Prometheus called the space jockey guys. They were created by David, the first synthetic sentient android created by Weyland, when he and Shaw hijacked an engineer ship. He returned to their home world, released the black goo and killed everything, and experiments with its ability to create multistage lifecycle semi-organic lifeforms, which he eventually managed to turn into the xenomorph as it was seen in the original Alien.The black goo itself seems to have been some sort of quasi-religious experiment thing the engineers developed billions of years ago that has the ability to dissolve organic matter, attach itself to DNA, and rewrite it to become some kind of more "advanced" lifeform. The beginning of Prometheus shows them doing this on earth, with a sacrificial engineer dissolving himself into primordial water to seed what would eventually become all earth life. This doesn't imply earth-life is genetically similar to the xenomorph, but rather to the engineers, who were humanoid. So Ridley Scott (or Damon Lindelof or whoever) is implying earth life was meant to eventually become humanoid all along, like we're the ultimate end of an experiment in engineered evolution.However, back on their home planet, they didn't just stop doing new things for four billion years. The black goo of the present in Prometheus was similar to the original used to seed earth, but seemingly had changed at that point and specifically created more xenomorph-like things, now by infecting other lifeforms and incubating in them, rather than dissolving them into free-floating DNA.All of that addresses whether xenomorphs are "related" in any biological sense to life on earth, but either way, I'm not convinced arthropods are the right analogy. The reality of their size and movement is obviously confounded by the fact they're played by humans wearing costumes, but I'd be surprised if they didn't have endoskeletons. Ridley Scott has stated the original intention of the creature design was to invoke armor. They're insect-like in appearance, but arthropod exoskeletons are not really armor. In fact, arthropods very rarely grow as large as humans, with the only examples all being extinct, and they had paper-thin exoskeletons, in part because molting something that large is difficult and expensive. To me, I think they're more similar to certain types of dinosaurs with hardened exterior armor. That said, they are clearly shown molting, but the fact they have claws and teeth seems to suggest they probably also have bones. I suspect this is mostly just confusion on the part of the designers or the simple fact they aren't really trying to make something that is biologically coherent or plausible so much as a nightmare made flesh.I don't think it's ever made clear what the engineers were trying to do. The timelines are a little jacked up, but the derelict the Prometheus crew discovers can't be the same one discovered later by the Nostromo, because the one of the Nostromo has actual fully-realized xenomorphs, which the narrative eventually makes clear were created by David after the events of Prometheus. The derelict in that case was simply carrying black goo, but a weaponized version, and carrying it to earth, apparently intending to destroy all life there. Why is never explained, nor does it seem to be the case that this was some civilization-wide decision, since the mission failed and no follow-on was ever launched. This could have been some rogue faction that weaponized black goo and attempted to destroy life that had earlier been created by the non-weaponized older version out of disagreement with the larger historical goals of their own people.Weyland-Yutani corps by the time of the mainline films seems to not understand what they are dealing with. They understand they have found some substance that can meld with organic life and create a stronger version of it that doesn't need food and can survive in a vacuum. Romulus seems to suggest that the goal at that point was to create a race of hybrid mine workers that would survive the harsh conditions better than humans. They don't seem to have ever realized that David had created the xenomorphs as they existed at that point and his goal was not to create better humans but to destroy all other life completely and replace it with xenomorphs.Considering all I've written to this point, I'm amazed at how silly the mythology of this series eventually got after starting as a simple great horror flick that needed no explanation or backstory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The xenomorph’s multicellular structure serves as a cornerstone for its classification within Animalia (Ros-Rocher et al., 2021). Its intricate organization of cells, tissues, and organs reflects a level of biological complexity commonly associated with animals.This is already wrong! Animalia is an Earth kingdom, and the Xenomorphs clearly aren't an Earth life-form.&gt; Xenomorphs can be included into the Arthropoda phylum due to the morphological similarities shared with certain terrestrial arthropods such as an exoskeletal structure, a segmented body plan, the presence of hemolymph, etc.Again, no! They're not an Earth life-form. Just because they superficially resemble some arthropods in some features doesn't make them an arthropod! You might as well say that a train is an arthropod - exoskeletal structure, segmented body plan, the presence of hemolymph...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42296970</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Bicameral Not Homoiconic" explores the concept of bicameralism in programming languages, highlighting the distinction between languages that are homoiconic (where code and data share the same structure) and those that are not. It discusses the historical context of programming language design, the implications of these structures on code readability and maintainability, and how having two separate chambers for code and data can lead to more robust programming practices. The article advocates for a deeper understanding of language design principles to enhance developers' effectiveness in writing clear and efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42292805"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Homoiconic has a pretty clear definition. It was coined by someone in reference the property of a specific system, many decades ago. That system stored program definitions in the same form that the programmer entered them in (either just the original character-level text, or some tokenized version of it), allowing the definitions to be recalled at runtime and redefined. He turned "same form" into "homoiconic" with the help of Greek/Latin. It's all in the Wikipedia.Line numbered BASIC is homoiconic: you can edit any line of code and continue the program.POSIX shell lets functions be redefined. They can be listed with the set command executed without arguments, and copy-pasted.In Common Lisp, there is a function called ed, support for which is implementation-defined. If support is available, it is supposed to bring up an editor of some kind to allow a function definition to be edited. That is squarely a homoiconic feature.Without ed support or anything like it, the implementation does not retain definitions in a way that can be edited; i.e. is not homoiconic. Some Lisps compile everything entered into them; you cannot edit a defun because it has been turned into machine language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I understand the gist of this article it goes like ...1. Scanner divides source-code-string into ordered chunks each with some identifying information, what is the type and content of each chunk.2. The next stage better NOT be a "Parser" but a "Reader" which assembles the chunks into a well-formed tree-structure thus recognizing which chunks belong togeether in the branches of such trees.3. Parser then assigns "meaning" to the nodes and branches of the tree produced by Reader, by visiting them. "Meaning" basically means (!) what kind of calculation will be performed on some nodes of the tree.4. It is beneficial if the programming language has primitives for accessing the output of the reader, so it can  have macros that morph the reader-produced tree so it can ask the parser to do its job on such a re-morphed tree.Did I get it close?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems that the Rust macro system is inspired by a similar idea: In the first step (the "reader" in this article's terminology), the source is converted into something called a token tree.A token tree is not a full parse tree with resolved operator precedence and whatnot. It only has child nodes for bracket pairs ((), [] and {}) and their contents, in part to determine where the macro call ends. Otherwise, it's a flat list of tokens that the macro (what this article would call the "parser") can interpret in any way it wants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42292805</guid></item><item><title>25.

Tech was all about optimism and idealism. Everyone in silicon valley knew they were changing the world for the better, and tech was the missing piece all along. Silly people would finally all stop fighting and get along now that they had Facebook and Twitter and iPhones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember this. Wish I'd kept my little piece of history.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Thinking in Actors: Part 1" by Jeremy Carter explores the concept of applying the principles of acting and character development to enhance storytelling and creative processes. Carter discusses how understanding the motivations, backgrounds, and objectives of characters can lead to more compelling narratives in various media. He emphasizes the importance of viewing characters as individuals with distinct voices and layers, advocating for a deeper connection to their experiences to enrich both writing and performance. The piece serves as an introduction to a series that aims to provide insight into the intersection of acting techniques and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is where erlang/elixir really shines! Using actor processes (aka genservers) to model business workflows and logic helps to align the programmer's and stakeholder's shared understanding and language of a feature, which leads to the implementation and expectations about it to be much more "correct".Too many of us jump straight to modeling the domain objects as database tables without formalizing the the data model of the actual business need. Explicit state changes and considering "time" are way more important than database layout at that point.And please either use operation explicit types and/or finite state machines when modeling the main domain objects.My last three jobs started with untangling a bunch of "status" fields into explicit and hierarchical structures so that the whole company could agree and define what each of them actually meant. Common language, yo! It's the secret sauce!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; State can be persisted (e.g., to storage, database or event log) between messages. If an actor crashes, it can recover its state on another node and resume processing.And that's the part I never managed to solve, personally. The state of actors tend to look "a lot like" your domain objects, but you don't want to store it until the very end.Do you have a data-model for each actor to store their own snapshots ? When do you snapshot ? When do you sync with the "ground truth" ? Do you have different tech for each kind of state (eg "term storage" for actors, then relational db for ground truth ?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suspect that a lot of what can be done with actors can be done in Go using the "Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating". Basically a consumer of a channel can act like an actor. What we don't get for free is the activation and resiliency. A closer one would be Erlang/Elixir on the BEAM. On the more advanced end would be using F# or Pony.Curious to see what the follow-up parts will post. I am interested in actor model programming and want to see different ways of understanding and using them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291125</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time I end up using repos with submodules, I'm stuck in the submodule unwedging dance at some point. It's just not worth it. Either it's stuck with changes that accidentally snuck into the subtree (rm -rf and submodule init/update), the commit is bad and git can't update to it somehow (maybe it's not a tag and can't be fetched? usually gets fixed with rm -rf and submodule init/update), or maybe it's just when I switched branches and it's left in a dirty state because...  reasons.Git is elegant is so many ways, but submodules are the broken, ugly stepchild of the beauty that git is.I suspect it's not the idea of submodules, but the terrible, terrible command interface to them and how badly they work with the rest of the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't get the opposition to submodule. imho it's fine, there are limited options with it, so limited chance it may go wrong.some suggested package manager, which imho is another layer of dependency, e.g. in Python, it always takes me some extra seconds to figure out which package manager I'm supposed to use, and it's constantly evolving.end of day it's up to which one you are most familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not only are they “a pain” but I see git submodules as the technical equivalent of a “Big Tent” political party trying to fit mutiple divergent factions into a single entity.At some point someone in a submodule repo is going to go rogue and make something incompatible with the bigger picture.  Psychologically, they’ve merged to their trunk so as far as they are concerned their change is complete.  Task done, “mission accomplished”.  Yet until it’s also in the parent repo’s trunk, it might as well still be on a branch.In a monorepo, the rogue coder would instead still be on a branch.  They’re done when their branch works and their change is merged (er, ff’d!) onto the one true main, not before.None of this applies to FOSS projects.  Those are Big Tents where political negotiations are constantly required to keep various democratically equal projects aligned.In the corporate world though I am entirely happy with a one party state running a top down, planned economy of N year plans following CEO-Thought, and with a single repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291833</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, this basically says "LLMs aren't pre-trained on enough 1D timeseries data" - there's a classic technique in time series analysis where you just do a wavelet or FFT on the time series and feed it into a convnet as an image, leveraging the massive pre-training on, e.g. ImageNet. This "shouldn't" be the best way to do it, since a giant network should learn a better internal representation than something static like FFT or a wavelet transform. But there's no 1D equivalent of ImageNet so it still often works better than a 1D ConvNet trained from scratch.Same applies here. An LLM trained on tons of time series should be able to create its own internal representation that's much more effective than looking at a static plot, since plots can't represent patterns at all scales (indeed, a human plotting to explore data will zoom in, zoom out, transform the timeseries, etc.). But since LLMs don't have enough 1D timeseries pretraining, the plot-as-image technique leverages the massive amount of image pre-training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to sound too dismissive of someone's hard work but I was kind of hoping for something more sophisticated than showing an LLM the image of a plot.  Using the article's example, I would be interested in understanding causes (or even just correlations) of near falls - is it old people, or people who didn't take their vitamins, or people who recently had an illness, etc.?  What's the best way of discovering these that isn't me slicing the data by X and looking at the plot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It kind of feels criminal to do time-series analysis with multimodel models and not use any traditional numerical models to provide a baseline result. It's an interesting result though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299590</guid></item><item><title>30.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting! I feel like this is a cross between https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr (switch state for context) and https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow because the output of the "task" declares its next hop...The challenge with this approach though is that you need to run the actual code to see what it does, or as a developer build up a mental model of the code ... but it does shine in certain use cases -- and also reminds me of https://github.com/insitro/redun because it takes this approach too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSA: It’s really rude when someone does a show HN to go and plug your own competitor. Let them have their moment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I agree complex conditional LangGraph setups get pretty tedious after a certain point - though you claim to not use graphs here, but isn't that essentially what returning the "next task" does? The graph isn't explicitly defined but it still exists implicitly if you trace through all the tasks and next tasks.Would be interesting to see a complex agent implementation in both Flow and regular LangGraph to compare maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299098</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, the actual prop was auctioned off in 2022 for more than $18K! [0][0] https://propstoreauction.com/lot-details/index/catalog/319/l...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just as a note, real chemical weapons are not like this at all. Basically, VX (in the US and basically all other countries) is stored in binary form(1), two separate, basically clear chemicals with a glass wall that separates them, and the wall breaks from the force of the blast and the chemicals mix and you have VX, but it doesn't look cool. So Michael Bay had them make this instead, because it looked better on film.There was a famous bit from the Iraq Inquiry Committee (aka the Chilcot Report) where they found that MI6 reported a bit of intelligence to Tony Blair that a source in Iraq claimed that they produced VX at the Al-Yarmuk plant- but described what was in the movie, not real life. After it was reported to Blair that they had sources who had seen VX in Iraq, they showed the raw intelligence to someone who knew something about chemical weapons and they said "Whatever your source saw, it wasn't VX" and MI6 realized that the source was lying. (I think that this source is different from the more famous liar Curveball.)1: Besides being bad for humans, VX is also bad for metal, and will destroy any case if kept in long term storage. Basically if you load a normal chemical weapon shell with mixed, ready to go VX it will be unusable- more of a threat to the crew firing the howitzer than the enemy- within a few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a related note: for a more realistic portrayal of VX-like-agent-in-a-terror-plot, see Michael Crichton's novel "Binary".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42292909</guid></item><item><title>33.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the history and significance of the Sperry Rand Corporation, highlighting its formation through the merger of Sperry Corporation and Rand Corporation in 1955. It covers the company's contributions to various technological fields, including computing and defense, as well as its key products like the UNIVAC computer, which played a pivotal role in the development of early information technology. The piece also addresses the company's eventual decline in prominence due to industry changes and competition, while recognizing its impact on both corporate culture and technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked for Sperry Univac 1974-79, in Halifax, Montreal and Calgary. I was an "SA", Systems Analyst at the service of the Sales team. It was a lot of fun. The Univac salesmen were the cowboys that didn't fit in at IBM. When preparing benchmarks, money was no object, we had lavish expense accounts. In the Oil Patch I saw $100K deals signed during coffee break.One of Univac's problems was the proliferation of operating systems for the different incompatible architectures. There was Exec 8 for the premier 1100 series (36-bit); OS/4, OS/3, OS/7 and later VS/9 (formerly RCA's TSOS then VMOS) for the 9000 series (32-bit); also the 418 and 494 real-time OS'es (18-bit words). Then there was the CADE 1900. All written in Assembler of course. We even had Varian in the branch, with salesmen from the different product lines competing for business.All this duplication resulted in overhead and squandering of programmer resources.After the Burroughs merger, the joke was that UNISYS stood for "Univac is Still Your Supplier".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a very well written history of the US navy's first shipboard computer system.https://ethw.org/First-Hand:No_Damned_Computer_is_Going_to_T...The article shows up here fairly regularly. I mainly bring it up as the computer was developed by Sperry, and it really is a good read about an early tech project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please note that the "solid state computer" wasn't fully transistorized[1]. Much of the logic was magnetic logic[2]. (Which is solid state, but not semiconducting)This happened at the time when Germanium transistors were hand made, and quite unreliable, less reliable that even vacuum tubes. Magnetic core was much more reliable than either.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_Solid_State[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_logic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288312</guid></item><item><title>35.

    da un fulgore in che sua voglia venne.

    But then my mind was struck by light that flashed
    and, with this light, received what it had asked.

    like a wheel revolving uniformly — by

&lt;p&gt;A recent study has documented Ethiopian wolves feeding on nectar for the first time, suggesting a significant dietary expansion for this endangered species. Researchers observed the wolves extracting nectar from flowers, which may provide important nutritional benefits, particularly in the context of climate change and habitat alterations. The findings highlight the adaptability of Ethiopian wolves and underscore the need for ongoing conservation efforts to protect their habitats and food sources as these animals face increasing environmental pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a “dog” my wife adopted in Africa that looks almost exactly like an Ethiopian wolf. When I read about the temperament and behavior of wolves kept as pets, he checks every single box to a T. We love him, but he is far more intelligent and challenging than any dog I have ever known. He cannot be near anyone he does not know well, and negative discipline of any kind does not work at all on him, and would be dangerous to even attempt. We joke that he is a wolf, but sometimes I wonder if it is literally true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. What a blast to see this here. I paid for an expedition and went on a 3-day horse riding tour in the Bale Mountains with some rangers, looking for the Ethiopian Wolf. And I was able to observe him. Looks like an oversized fox. Cute. Shy, normally hunts the rats that live on the plateau. Three days on a horse that I and my a... will never forget."The Ethiopian wolf is the rarest wild canid species in the world, and Africa’s most threatened carnivore. Found only in the Ethiopian highlands, fewer than 500 individuals survive,"There are protection efforts from the Senckenberg Society and they do a pretty good job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It becomes less surprising when you see a photo of the flower. It's huge, so it's not that unlike large mammals eating fruit or honey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232465</guid></item><item><title>39.

The rest? Uh… can I get an ELI5 please?Even though I’m clearly not in the target demographic, I’m eager to learn more..Edit: ok, clicked through to GitHub, now I (kinda) got what it’s for :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starred!I’ve been playing with hooking up a MIDI controller to my OBSBot Tail Air PTZ camera and OBS.The config and filters and triggers looks similar to my prototypes.I’ve been wondering if there’s any sort of prior art or standards here from other domains like lighting consoles or workflow systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42298713</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is somewhat outdated. GNU make now uses named pipes by default on platforms that support it.https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Job...It's a bit more robust. For example when you have a Makefile like this:    target:
        +python3 script.py $@

where `script.py` itself spawns a sub-process that is jobserver aware (like make, gcc, cargo, ...), you don't have to worry about whether the fds of the python process, needed for communicating with the jobserver, are inherited in the subprocess.Previously you had to run `subprocess.Popen(..., close_fds=False)` and make sure MAKEFLAGS was inherited.Now you only have to ensure MAKEFLAGS is propagated, and that the sub-process can access the fifo by path (which is sometimes problematic, for example when running docker).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust/Cargo has adopted this protocol: https://lib.rs/jobserver&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so that comes quite right. Im currently working on a codebase that has evolved over 30-ish years. The makefiles are quite a mess and since ages, the software has been built sequentially which results in build times beeing much longer than required.Of course the project consists of multiple module which you should be able to build seperately, thus recursive calls are quite common amongst the makefiles.First test with only a hand full of jobs (-j) already failed in the beginning, i could fix these quite fast (missing makefile targets).Now i have the situation that on some build systems (with faster CPU) i still see races, where the same makfile target for a subproject runs at the same time and overwrites each others target files. On other build systems it works without any issue. However, ive still failed to reproduce the failure manually, it usually happens during automatic build invoked by jenkins or gitlab.Is there a way to make "make" simulate those builds so one could tell where the cause for the races is in detail?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42248567</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The page outlines the funding goals for the video game Star Citizen, detailing various stretch goals that enhance gameplay, graphics, and features as the game's funding reaches certain milestones. It emphasizes community engagement and the importance of player support in shaping the development of the game, showcasing how funds contribute to expanding its universe and improving player experiences. The goals include both financial targets and elements that will be added or upgraded to enrich gameplay and maintain high production values.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think my biggest beef with the game is how unstable it is.The game design is a bit grindy, whatever, lets grind away then, however any time I start to make any progress the game crashes. After two or three of these I loose interest. Only to try again in 6 months to much the same results.They appear to be following a long term slow burn development plan, nothing wrong with this many of my favorite games follow this same pattern, factorio, valheim,  however these games follow the cardinal rule of public development which is "keep it stable" it has been 10 years and star citizen still is a crashy mess.They have a lot of neat tech in their engine, seamless space to surface to inside to instance is not trivial. But I wish they would just sit down for a quarter and stabilize the thing. I like to joke that the elevators in the game are probably some of their most advanced tech, the punchline is that if you have played the game you know that most of the crashes and other weirdness involve elevators. but I am only half-joking. because the elevators really are connecting zones and instances in a cool seamless way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To be honest, I think the biggest difficulty this game faces is that at this level of funding and this time amount of development time, I'm not sure you can actually make something that lives up to the hype. From what I've heard the stuff that's implemented so far is pretty good, albeit buggy. And the team definitely has the skill to make something amazing.But you don't want decent or even good from a project that's spent over 12 years in development with over $700 million of development costs. You want a genre defining masterpiece that puts pretty much everything else in the genre (or even industry) to shame.I'm not sure it'll be possible to deliver that, at least to the degree you'd expect from a game this expensive. At a certain level of development time/costs, expectations become so high that it's almost impossible not to disappoint everyone with the finished product. And I think Star Citizen passed that point a long time ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I funded this back on kickstarter when I was still in high school. I remember the excitement that came with every $1mil milestone, it really felt like an incredible movement that was going to produce something really special. I haven't been able to follow progress closely over the past decade, but the gameplay demos have been fun and there always seems to be a decent amount of progress so at this point I think I'm content waiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291101</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They're throwing money away. Actually, I would be glad if this money was entirely used for research, because Intel and other US companies badly need it. But they will waste it on plants that are already outdated in the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is Intel giving this money to investors directly or indirectly in the form of stock buy backs. And nothing of this would be necessary if Intel had invested their profits in research, instead of sending money to investors to keep the stock price high and, consequently, their executive compensation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's actually pretty cool. Chip companies can't complain that Chinese companies are ramping up faster just because of their subsidies anymore. This should level the playing field, hopefully?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The x86 companies (and/intel) do better with competition.I’ve had my last laptops (work/home) with amd and it’s much better battery life and performance  then my (9th? Gen) intel notebook with nvidia (the battery life was Terrible but it could game). I think Apple puts a lot of pressure on too, which helps.I guess intels “ultra” notebook parts are better.There is some x86 advisory group now to keep the instruction set in sync between the 2 companies.  Linux is involved and is Linus so it should be at least a little fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42248272</guid></item><item><title>46.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a very specific kind of feedback but, your app seems to not be aware of the way that the top bar works on for example iPhone 15 Pro.This results in part of the UI of your app shown on first launch ("Window Controls" menu, containing "App Tools", "Files", "Editor", "GitHub") being obscured by the black oval that surrounds the camera on the top of the display on these phones. This happens in portrait as well as landscape orientation.You’ll probably be able to see the same issue if you select the iPhone 15 Pro or similar model in the iPhone simulator in Xcode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I could see this working really well with call flow graphs for reverse engineering or disassemblers like IDA or Ghidra see https://clearbluejar.github.io/assets/img/2023-01-22-callgra...Can this work with visionos?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried this out on an iPhone 15 Pro.Some notes:- Opening in portrait mode, the Window Controls title bar is obscured by the Dynamic Island. I cannot move this window without going to landscape orientation.- The "Open Folder" button on the Files window doesn't work. File access is never requested.- The App Tools window looks funky in landscape mode. The tab bar is only 50% filled, vertically.- Windows appear in inconvenient locations, offscreen, partially obscured, or have strange sizing. I found myself rotating between portrait and landscape mode frequently just to do basic UI interactions.- Global Search completely obscures other windows, and its title bar is offscreen. This breaks the app. I have to force-close to get it back into a working state.You should probably pull iPhone support until this is tested more thoroughly. I imagine similar issues occur on iPad. Not to be harsh, but it's literally unusable on iPhone in its current state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291002</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's funny because the first thing I do when I write a LaTeX document is to make it look less like a (default) LaTeX document.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So unfortunate that justified text in browsers looks awful compared to documents generated with LaTeX (usually)....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;did not read the whole document. just the proof of theorem 1 and it has a minor error. it is not obvious that C(n) != x. that is because it is not true. to see that, consider a map C(n) such thatC(n) = 0.10000000...that is: c_1(n) = 1 and c_i(n) = 0 for all other i.If you let \overline{c}_1(n) = 0 and c_i(n) = 9 for all other i,
then we have that c_i(n) != \overline{c}(c)_i(n) for all i but C(n) = x.This is a common mistake people make. To fix it, one needs to be more careful when defining \overline{c}_i.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244832</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "black hole puzzle," addressing the complexities and paradoxes related to black holes in the context of quantum mechanics and general relativity. It explores how information is handled within black holes and the implications for our understanding of physics, particularly the challenge of reconciling the loss of information with quantum theory's principles. The author presents various perspectives and ongoing research efforts aimed at resolving these fundamental issues, ultimately reflecting on the broader impact of these questions on our comprehension of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What this thread is really missing is a simulation. I can't promise its the enterprise (as the performance constraints are crippling), but here's a bunch of cubes instead:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTw0pJvTkGwIt seems that what you see is the object flattened on the shadow in front of you, and it remains flattened. Apparently past me didn't implement redshift on objects, but its likely extremely redshiftedEdit:Here's a second better clip, showing this more clearlyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npC6lCwYUN0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a good episode of PBS Spacetime about Penrose diagrams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4oYvSH6jJ8It gets a little far into the weeds in a very "the map is not the territory" kind of way, but is fun none the less.I think (it is not addressed to my satisfaction in the video) that it is implied that from inside the black hole, assuming it was formed from a collapsing star, you would see all around you the event horizon: behind you, the unverise at the time you crossed the event horizin, in front of you, the surface of the star at the moment of its collapse. The singularity, as the post covers, exists only in your future, so you could not see it, even though you will always end up there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is argued that Bob sees light from Alice's crossing of the horizon at the same instant Bob himself crosses. Isn't this true of all matter that enters? When Bob enters, he sees everything that ever fell into the black hole "before" him, at all once? Is it blinding? Does it fry and scramble Bob? Or is it so redshifted that Bob survives?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299891</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a proposed amendment to challenging the legal assumption that computers are inherently reliable. It highlights the historical context of the Post Office scandal, where reliance on computer systems led to wrongful convictions and financial losses for subpostmasters. The proposal aims to ensure that the legal system does not automatically assume the accuracy of computer evidence, advocating for a more thorough examination of technology used in legal contexts to prevent similar injustices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those not familiar with recent UK scandals, there has been one ongoing for a few years where there was a bug in a system designed by Fujitsu that was calculating the finances for post offices. This resulted in the system quoting wrong balances for post offices, and when that didn't match the actual cash in hand, resulted in prosecutions of the postmasters responsible for those offices which in turn led to convictions, dismissals, fines, imprisonments, and suicides over a 15 year period as the computer system was presumed correct.Anyway, it was later proven the computer system was incorrect but the government there dragged their heels on exoneration and compensation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that this misnomer of infallible computer systems was ever enshrined in law is pretty damning of the whole UK legal system and the relationship between technical people and law.Every person who has ever programmed a computer or worked in any complex system knows they can't be relied upon 100%.Not least because it seems to go against the core concept of "innocent until proven guilty" that the whole legal system is meant to rest upon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a long time I was pushing a campaign that every piece of software paid for with public funds should be made FOSS (unless national security etc).I struggle to work out why a post office point of sale should be vital to Britains security and we should have been able to see the code.On top of which I believe that making such code open means there will become a eco-system of ISPs who will be able to support, integrate and improve the software and provide local government users (ie postmasters) with worthwhile consultancy 
Under these circumstances it’s hard to see how this would have gone uncovered for so long.(Or rather, not uncovered, but unbelieved. The great tragedy of this affair is that us was known and reported on for years - but nothing happened.  You know those films where the hero manages to get the proof to the newspaper / tv station and the film ends as the bad guys are bundled into police vans - yeah not so much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42294902</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem here is that I don’t trust the author on being able to tell who is the “best artist”. Clearly he has opinions. But for example in point 3, he says he can predict which exhibition will be great based on how easy it is to work with the artist. He predicts that some exhibition will be crap and he is right! Which sounds impressive until you notice that he is not measuring his judgement against something objective, but just against his judgement. He decides something will be crap and then he feels crap about it once he sees it. Did others, who did not know that the artist was slow to email back also feel that those exhibitions were mediocre and the others not? Who knows? All we have is this one man’s opinion. Maybe others thought differently.Even more so in his point 6. He writes “What you see in the biographies of great artists, great writers, great anything is that they are good at figuring out where the vectors align.” Which is just plainly and absolutely not true. There were plenty of people who we now recognise as “great artist” who absolutely could not figure out where the “incentive vectors align”. Thus they lived in abject poverty, or needed to support themselves from something other than their art. But if your definition of “great art” is that it is commercially succesfull then of course what you will find that the “great artist” are all like good businesman. But that doesn’t tell you about what it take to be an artist, just only what you value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duvara bantlanmış muzun astronomik bir rakama satılması, sanat dünyasında ve toplum genelinde farklı tepkilere yol açmıştır. Bu olay, sanatın değerinin ve anlamının subjektif olduğunu bir kez daha hatırlatıyor. Sanat, her birey için farklı bir deneyim sunabilir ve bu da onun güzelliğini ve önemini oluşturan unsurlardan biridir.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I refuse to believe that not answering every single email within an hour is a good predictor of anything other than being glued to your phone. I think extending it to a reasonable amount of time, maybe a business day max, works out pretty well. Sometimes people respond really fast because they’re taking regular breaks and other times they don’t respond all evening because they’re putting on their kid’s birthday party. Even at work, sometimes very good colleagues are doing things back-to-back for hours and using short windows to do things like go to the bathroom.On the other hand maybe this is some art thing I’m too far away from to understand? Maybe really good artists to work with never need more than twenty minutes of deep focus at a time for anything?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302784</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The Copper Release Log provides a detailed chronological account of updates and changes made to the Copper project, an open-source framework written in Rust. It documents each release's version number, date, and a summary of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other notable modifications. This log serves as a resource for developers and users to track the project's evolution and make informed decisions about using and contributing to Copper.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to suffer a bit from the same problem that affects a lot of "new" robotics frameworks: the beginnings are simple, and it's easy at that stage to think that everything else is over-complicated.The comparison with ROS 2 is a bit questionable. Comparing a single-process-only (Copper) approach using shared memory with a multi-process system (ROS 2) using default DDS settings really isn't comparing the same thing. There are ways to make the ROS 2 system much faster if you're willing to be limited to similar constraints (single process with components, or local-system shared-memory transport) but most people don't because those constraints are very limiting in practical applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tangent this got me thinking about: Why are the robotics and embedded communities generally separate, with little overlap in people and tech? For example, this project seems unrelated to the rust embedded tooling. And the components categories are also unfamiliar, e.g. the IMUs and ADCs in the readme, using a SBC vice a MCU etc.Another angle: `ROS` and `RTOS` share letters, but not much else!I gather that robotics is a fusion of embedded and mechanical engineering; I refer to the former.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s great to see more innovation in the robotics framework space, it’s sorely needed.Deterministic log replay is a killer feature to have baked in from the start - many autonomous vehicle &amp; robotics companies have invested years of effort to achieve that nirvana, while the most popular robotics framework today (ROS) makes it borderline impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302026</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article reviews Intel's Arc B580 Battlemage graphics processing unit (GPU), discussing its architecture, features, and performance benchmarks compared to competitors. It highlights the GPU's capabilities in gaming and professional applications, examines its pricing and market positioning, and explores its potential impact on the graphics card landscape. The review also addresses thermal management, power consumption, and driver support, offering insights into the overall user experience with this new offering from Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why don't they just release a basic GPU with 128GB RAM and eat NVidia's local generative AI lunch? The networking effect of all devs porting their LLMs etc. to that card would instantly put them as a major CUDA threat. But beancounters running the company would never get such an idea...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll have to wait for first-party benchmarks, but they seem decent so far. A 4060 equivalent $200-$250 isn't bad at all. for  I'm curious if we'll get a B750 or B770 and how they'll perform.At the very least, it's nice to have some decent BUDGET cards now. The ~$200 segment has been totally dead for years. I have a feeling Intel is losing a fair chunk of $ on each card though, just to enter the market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think a graphics card tailored for 2k gaming is actually great. 2k really is the goldilocks zone between 4k and 1080p graphics before you start creeping into diminishing returns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308590</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for posting this to HN! Author here, happy to answer any questions.(By the way, I did not originally start the project, though I've worked quite a bit on the safe abstractions that are mentioned in the roadmap).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've said this before on here and I'll say it again. The QEMU code base is a nightmare. The amount of fake C++ is mind numbing. Every time I come across a variable or strict declaration or method with the word "class" in it, I'm reminded of how much easier the whole thing would've been with C++. You can't even compile C++ into QEMU because of how the headers use keywords. That's not even touching their macro abuse template functions. You know what has templates and classes? C++. And constructors. There's just so much.All this to say: if Rust can make it in, that's great, because I'm tired of dealing with C's simplicity for more complicated tasks. I'm not a rust user but if it lets me use classes and templates, I'll switch over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any ideas why people are relying on distro packaged Rust for development instead of rustup? For Rust it feels weird making development choices around several year old versions of the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253814</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;Skia Canvas is a web-based graphics library that provides a simple API for drawing 2D graphics on HTML5 canvas elements. It leverages the Skia Graphics Library to enable developers to create high-performance graphics applications for web browsers. The site offers documentation, examples, and resources to help users understand how to use the library effectively for rendering shapes, text, and images, making it easier to build visually rich web applications. Additionally, it highlights the library's compatibility with various platforms and its underlying performance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://windowjs.org is a very similar concept -- it wraps Skia and exposes it as the Canvas API, but also embeds v8 for a very small runtime instead of using Node.It was my first open-source project, released about 3 years ago.I had plans to also expose WebGL, audio, etc and make it a viable platform for Javascript-based games on desktop.Life and other projects happened instead, and development was discontinued. Happy to see this project also making Canvas accessible outside the browser!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skia ships with a WASM build that supports node, called CanvasKit [1], whereas this module is Rust bindings? I’d be keen to know what the pros and cons of each approach are.1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvaskit-wasm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Out of curiosity, what's the use for such library? If you are on a desktop surely there is a better native library to draw shapes, no?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308051</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The website "Egoless Engineering" focuses on promoting a culture of humility and collaboration within the engineering field. It emphasizes the importance of egoless behavior, encouraging engineers to prioritize teamwork, open communication, and constructive feedback. Key topics include the benefits of vulnerability, effective conflict resolution, and fostering a supportive work environment that values contributions from all team members, regardless of their role or experience level. The goal is to create more efficient, innovative, and positive workplaces in technology and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I've realized is that people in different roles have different levers to solve problems, and they naturally skew to using that lever to try and solve all problems, even if that lever can't solve the problem and could make it worse.A manager, to which directors, CEOs, and so on are all included in, have this lever which is that they can hire more people and create new roles/re-organize teams. And they skew towards it for many problems...We want to deliver features faster, what can I do, me, a manager?    - I could hire more engineers!
    - I could reorganize my engineers so each one works on a specific type of issue

It becomes really hard to accept that, maybe, as a manager, you can't do anything about it, except support and encourage those that can, like the engineers themselves. How could you help them deliver features faster?I'm picking at managers, but every role has this issue. Engineers have this lever of "technical ingenuity". And they skew to it as the solution to all problems.We want to deliver features faster, what can I do, me, a software engineer?    - I could rewrite this in a more productive language/framework
    - I could redesign this to make it simpler and easier to work on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really resonated with this, reminded me of the journey I went on over the course of my dev career. By the end, my advice for every manager was roughly:* Don't add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed.* Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.)* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week.* Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)* Never forget your team is full of actual humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ageless idea...  "There once was the first software engineering best-selling book. It was called The Psychology of Computer Programming (Weinberg 1971). There was a peculiar idea contained among the many excellent ideas of that book. It was the idea that the task of programming should be egoless. Programmers, the author said, should not invest their ego in the product they were building. 
  ...

  What’s the alternative to an ego-invested programmer? A team-player programmer. 
  The team player sees the software product as a team effort and a team achievement. Error reports and reviews and questions become team inputs to help improve the product, not threatening attacks to derail progress.
  ...
  But after further thought, this notion begins to unravel. It is all well and good to advocate egoless programming, but the fact of the matter is that human ego is a very natural thing, and it is difficult to find people who can—or even should—divorce their ego from their work.
  ...
  A system that works will have to acknowledge fundamental human traits and work within the bounds they create. And ego is one of those traits.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the increasing prevalence of phishing attacks that exploit new top-level domains (TLDs) such as .shop and .xyz. It explains that these domains are often cheaper and easier to acquire than established TLDs, making them attractive to cybercriminals. The piece highlights how these new TLDs can be easily manipulated to create convincing phishing sites that trick users into revealing sensitive information. It also emphasizes the importance of user awareness and security measures to combat these tactics, as well as the need for registrars and policymakers to ensure better protections against the misuse of these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305831"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The implication that gTLDs are bad and new ones shouldn't be introduced because of this is a bit silly to me. The argument that they somehow have lower registration requirements makes no sense, .shop .top and .xyz registrations involve the exact same amount of verification as .com (none). Prices aren't really that different and plenty of gTLDs are more expensive than traditional ones.Registering a domain is frustrating these days, too many already taken and a lot of them by squatters not even intending to use it. I'd love to see more options personally even if it makes it slightly easier to create a phishing domain. We need better tools than memorizing a domain name to deal with that anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole environment of the newer gTLDs just feels… gross.  I rarely find a reputable business that is using anything but .com or .co.XX as the primary domain.Putting on my regular-person hat: When I see a billboard or print ad with e.g. `example.travel`, I read that as a social media handle and not a website address like `example.com` would convey. In public perception, dot com means websites. Always has.(Tangentially, the `.sucks` TLD in particular should never have been allowed. How many brands out there have to maintain a perfunctory registration there just to prevent somebody else from doing so?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; new gTLDs introduced in the last few years command just 11 percent of the market for new domains, but accounted for roughly 37 percent of cybercrime domains reported between September 2023 and August 2024.&gt; .com and .net domains made up approximately half of all domains registered...they accounted for just over 40 percent of all cybercrime domains.Hardly earth shattering. .net and .com are still pulling 80% of their weight when it comes to cybercrime. And the article concludes that the main reason the new TLDs are disproportionately used is because you can sometimes buy them cheap in bulk.Maybe the real story here is that the ccTLD registrars, who weren't mentioned, are disproportionately good at deterring cybercrime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305831</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the author’s decision to switch from using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to Go and HTMX for web development. The author expresses frustration with the complexities and fatigue associated with dependency management in React, highlighting issues like frequent updates, compatibility problems, and the overhead of maintaining numerous libraries. Instead, the author advocates for the simplicity and efficiency of using Go for backend development combined with HTMX for enhancing interactivity on the frontend, emphasizing a more streamlined approach to building web applications without the burdensome dependencies often seen in modern JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305348"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem is not so much React as it is the JS ecosystem, but React is just very visible when you have these issues because there are so so so many packages being imported.And the root of the problem is peer dependencies and the JS community's lack of backwards compatibility and maintenance.Take any decently-sized JS application, whether React or whatever else. Put it in Github. Turn on dependabot. Watch your pull requests go up by 5-10 PRs per week, just to bump minor versions, and then watch how 1 of those PRs, every single time, fails because of a peer dependency on a lower version.This has been a problem forever in the community, and there's no good solution. There's also just no feasible way to make a solution due to the nature of the language and the platform itself. You just have to absorb that problem when you decide to use eg Node for your backend code or React/etc for your frontend code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have very similar feelings to the author. I think it was back in 2019ish that I gave up on React &amp; co for good. Since then I have built a number of web apps on a relatively spartan stack of Actix, Tera and HTMX, and they have all stood the test of maintainability over time and have a core group of diehard users.Last week I shipped another new web app[1] I got an idea for in &lt;24h to closed alpha testers and in &lt;7d to a public beta with no issues or fanfare.Perhaps part of the increased velocity is my having gone deep and learned the ins and outs of this stack over multiple years and projects, but it is important to note that I probably would never have gained this level of mastery over these tools if I were constantly being hit with what the author calls "dependency management fatigue".[1]: https://blucerne.app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tanner builds libraries with a huge amount of functionality. But IMO he is not great at API design. His packages often have leaky abstractions which need to be patched over time.React Table and React Query are powerful but end up simultaneously doing too much and not doing enough, because their boundaries are in the wrong place.What’s wonderful about React is that it’s _not_ a framework. It does one thing well, and then stops at a well thought out, well documented, well tested boundary.I try to only adopt libraries that also meet that standard. It means you have a lot fewer libraries you can lean on, but it means the API surface you build on will be more stable for longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305348</guid></item><item><title>11.

Love the sprites. Thanks for the information on Piskel. Some possible "enhancements"1. Give us an indication on when the weapons are charged. Change in colour perhaps?2. Might be nice to show what the problem the opponent worked on is and what its result was so that we know.3. It might also be nice to put the sums solved so far in some kind of list at the bottom so that you can see what happened.4. The HP bar can change colour as the health goes down. Would add some more excitement to the game. :)5. Minor typo "chose" your move instead of "choose your move"I've been working through https://www.amazon.in/JavaScript-Kids-Playful-Introduction-P... with my own son. He's 12. I encouraged him to put the exercises he made onto a site as well as some of the things he wanted to do by himself. We've reached the chapters on the canvas element so more things will be coming.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the resurgence of vintage digital cameras and their appeal as artistic tools. It highlights how these cameras, once considered obsolete, are being embraced by photographers who appreciate their unique aesthetic qualities and the nostalgia they evoke. The piece discusses the technical limitations of these older devices, which can inspire creativity and a different photographic approach. It also mentions the community around vintage cameras, including enthusiasts who repair and share these models, emphasizing that their popularity extends beyond mere trendiness to become a meaningful statement about artistry and individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.”– Brian Eno&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random story: I went to the first ever digital imaging and technology film program to run in Canada, first cohort, 20+ years ago. There was one dude in our class that, in spite of the fact that our program didn't allow analog submissions, shot super16 all the time for his "personal projects and art", fine. So he kinda bothered me a bit, but did inspire me to, for the first, time grade my film to look like analog. I sucked all the contrast out, flattened it down and split toned it heavily. Submitted it to class and got the top grade for it. The guy was furious and went to the teacher to complain I shouldn't have submitted film, teacher came back to me to confirm I'd just graded it to look like film, and then told the dude my submission was accepted and my grade stood, but didn't tell him I shot it digital, so the guy goes and submits a 16mm short for his final because he thought I got away with it, ha.After I graduated, I stuck to the all digital stuff and a couple of folks from my program and I went on to start a film company, and win 3 Emmy awards, over the years I was still in film I saw people bring various analog film things to set to try and see if they could somehow include it, be it some film type, some vintage light panel or whatever, but it was always just fad, there was a period of time everyone brought 35 to set just to "see if we could fit it in later" - it never got cut in, it was too difficult to match it to the digital.It was always a fad bringing film to set, but those that did, I always admired they wanted to make that statement, no matter how foolish they seemed to many on set, I always appreciated the art they brought to the table.I recently bought a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P5 with a broken back screen, honestly I've had so much fun with it, I went out with my wife this last weekend, left the phone at home and brought the Sony, had a blast looking at the frames when I got home, do recommend it.Sorry for this random ass post, just this is my fav kinda HN content :D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think about this Brain Eno quote often. It’s always surprising when old worse formats resurface, yet it happens everytime.&gt; Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273518</guid></item><item><title>13.

Source: AWS Bedrock Pricing https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a digression, but I really wish Amazon would be more normal in their product descriptions.Amazon is rapidly developing its own jargon such that you need to understand how Amazon talks about things (and its existing product lineup) before you can understand half of what they're saying about a new thing. The way they describe their products seems almost designed to obfuscate what they really do.Every time they introduce something new, you have to click through several pages of announcements and docs just to ascertain what something actually is (an API, a new type of compute platform, a managed SaaS product?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No audio support: The models are currently trained to process and understand video content solely based on the visual information in the video. They do not possess the capability to analyze or comprehend any audio components that are present in the video.This is blowing my mind. gemini-1.5-flash accidentally knows how to transcribe amazingly well but it is -very- hard to figure out how to use it well and now Amazon comes out with a gemini flash like model and it explicitly ignores audio. It is so clear that multi-modal audio would be easy for these models but it is like they are purposefully holding back releasing it/supporting it. This has to be a strategic decision to not attach audio. Probably because the margins on ASR are too high to strip with a cheap LLM. I can only hope Meta will drop a mult-modal audio model to force this soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42309121</guid></item><item><title>15. 8 months of OCaml after 8 years of Haskell in production (2023)</title><link>https://chshersh.com/blog/2023-12-16-8-months-of-ocaml-after-8-years-of-haskell.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article reflects on the author's experience transitioning from eight years of using Haskell to eight months of learning and working with OCaml. It discusses the similarities and differences between the two functional programming languages, highlighting OCaml's performance, ease of use, and the advantages of its type system. The author also shares insights into their learning process, the challenges faced, and the overall benefits of expanding their programming skills. The piece emphasizes the enjoyment and value of exploring new languages while drawing on past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, this doesn't mention the thing that bothered me the most in my few encounters; how baroque and fluid the tooling is.I have regularly run into code that can only be compiled by a rather narrow range of ghc versions; too old or too new and it just won't.&gt; Haskell probably has the most elegant syntax across all languages I’ve seen (maybe Idris is better because dependently typed code can become ugly in Haskell really quickly).I have a general dislike for ML-type syntaxes, and Haskell is my least favorite of the ML-type syntaxes I have encountered.  Presumably there is some underlying set of principles that the author would like maximized that I assuredly do not.&gt; There’s utter joy in expressing your ideas by typing as few characters as possible.Disagree; if I did agree, then I would probably use something from the APL family or maybe Factor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the title is misleading.  This isn't really about either language in production environments.  As other commenters mentioned, a post about production would cover topics like whether there were any tooling / dependency updates that broke a build, whether they encountered any noticeable bugs in production caused by libraries / run time, and how efficiently the run times handle high load (e.g., with GC).This is more about syntax differences.  Even then, I'd be curious how well both languages accommodate themselves to teams and long term projects.  In both cases, you will have multiple people working on parts of the code base.  Are people able to read and modify code they haven't written -- for example, when fixing bugs?  When incorporating new sub components, how well did the type systems prevent errors due to refactoring?  It would be interesting to know if Haskell prevents a number of practical problems that occurred with OCaml or if, in practice, there was no difference for the types of bugs they encountered.This blog post feels more like someone is comparing basic language features found in reviews for new users rather than sharing deep experience and gotchas that only come from long-term use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like a moth to flame, I'm drawn to Haskell every 6 months or so. What drives me to it is its ability to express concepts (once you're used to it) parsimoniously - like the point-free style in the example. Monads, I can understand/manage. But by the time I hit Monad Transformers (and the n different packages available), the excitement turns into a headache.It's also a bummer that you need the containers package for basic DS. So, batteries not included, unlike Python. This also means that you need to use a package manager (stack or cabal) even for non-trivial programs, where a one-line ghci command line would have been more ergonomic.That said, learning Haskell has had a very positive effect on how I think about and structure the programs I write in other languages ("functional core, imperative shell"). I don't think I'll ever program in Haskell in any semi-serious capacity. But these days, I get my daily functional fix from using jq on the command line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302426</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This can lead to scalability issues in large clusters, as the number of connections that each node needs to maintain grows quadratically with the number of nodes in the cluster.No, the total number of dist connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes, but the number of dist connections each node makes grows linearally.&gt; Not only that, in order to keep the cluster connected, each node periodically sends heartbeat messages to every other node in the cluster.IIRC, heat beats are once every 30 seconds by default.&gt; This can lead to a lot of network traffic in large clusters, which can put a strain on the network.Lets say I'm right about 30 seconds between heart beats, and you've got 1000 nodes. Every 30 seconds each node sends out 999 heartbeats (which almost certainly fit in a single tcp packet each, maybe less if they're piggybacking on real data exchanges). That's 999,000 packets every second, or 33k pps across your whole cluster. For reference, GigE line rate with full 1500 mtu packets is 80k pps. If you actually have 1000 nodes worth of work, the heartbeats are not at all a big deal.&gt; Historically, a "large" cluster in Erlang was considered to be around 50-100 nodes. This may have changed in recent years, but it's still something to be aware of when designing distributed Erlang systems.I don't have recent numbers, but Rick Reed's presentation at Erlang Factory in 2014 shows a dist cluster with 400 nodes. I'm pretty sure I saw 1000+ node clusters too. I left WhatsApp in 2019, and any public presentations from WA are less about raw scale, because it's passe.Really, 1000 dist connections is nothing when you're managing 500k client connections. Dist connections weren't even a big deal when we went to smaller nodes in FB.It's good to have a solid backend network, and to try to bias towards fewer larger nodes, rather than more smaller nodes. If you want to play with large scale dist, so you spin up 1000 low cpu, low memory VMs, you might have some trouble. It makes sense to start with small nodes and whatever number makes you comfortable for availability, and then when you run into limits, reach for bigger nodes until you get to the point where adding nodes is more cost effective: WA ran dual xeon 2690 servers before the move to FB infra; facebook had better economics with smaller single Xeon D nodes; I dunno what makes sense today, maybe a single socket Epyc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ah the "erlang = distributed" thing.The primitives of sending messages across a "cluster" are built in the language, yep. And lightweight processes with a per-process garbage collector is magic on minimizing global gc pauses.But all the hard work to make a distributed system work are not "batteries included" for Erlang. Back pressure on messages, etc. you end up havig to build it yourself.We hit a limit at around 200 physical servers in a cluster back in 2015. Maybe it's gotten better since then. shrug.As the author calls out, it was built for the 80s, when a million dollar switch shouldn't fail. It isn't built with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STONITH in mind i.e. any node is trash, assume it will go away and maybe new ones will come back.Rock on, Erlang dude, rock on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's with the font? It seems to be flickering. Especially the headings. Is there a way to turn it off?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302673</guid></item><item><title>17.

From my anecdata, many of the voice AI agent builders are using SDKs and builder tools (Voiceflow, Vapi, Bland, Vocode, etc). Observability is usually already baked-in pattern with these SDKs (testing I'm not so sure of).One conversation I had with a voice agent builder: "Our product is complex enough where external testing tools don't make sense. And we know when things are not working because we have close relationships with power users and companies." Whose problem are you solving?Your tool looks very powerful, but might the broader opportunity be just to use your evals to roll out the best voice agents yourself?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run an AI services company and we've built voice bots for multiple clients. Is there a way for us to evaluate the agents on Vocera (these are custom builds not VAPI or Synthflow etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42307393</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is incredibly exciting! The main method available for PrEP, in the United States, at least, is a daily pill. I think (I don't know) there is a monthly shot, too.Daily pills take a lot of time investment; monthly shots are better; but once every 6 months is awesome! Especially in circumstances where it might be difficult to guarantee a daily pill or even a monthly shot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.So not as well? Is there a biological reason for this?Also, is it typical to do such studies on single genders rather than on a mix of humans?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a talk by someone from Gilead from a few years ago about how it works.[1] Back then they were still testing on animals.It's amazing that a small-molecule drug can be that effective for six months. It's not a vaccine. It doesn't stimulate the immune system. Completely different mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo has donated $25,000 to the Perl and Raku Foundation to support the development and maintenance of the Perl and Raku programming languages. This funding will help foster community education, improve infrastructure, and enhance the overall adoption of these languages. The contribution highlights DuckDuckGo's commitment to supporting open-source technologies and the active Perl programming community. The donation aims to further advance the legacy and sustainability of Perl and its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Craigslist used to donate over $100,000 every single year. Not sure when that stopped. That is really what kept perl going between the years of 2010 and 2016 or so. The board was actually paying a couple of people to do maintenance on the core repository and code. I believe they still do that but obviously due to deficits that is going to get difficult.It's sad when so many companies are dependent upon perl, but donate nothing. A good case in point is AT&amp;t in the 1980s was broken up into 20 plus different companies. They were then remerged back in the 1990s. But when they merged, they had 20 different computer systems and perl was actually used to glue all those systems together and handle data sanitation and ETL pipelines. Yet AT&amp;t never donated anything to perl.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A: This is great! Perl is much maligned but a fantastic Swiss army chainsaw and still runs so much critical infrastructure.B: I find it concerning that $25k is a notable donation; is the Foundation doing that poorly? I would have hoped this number to have two more digits in it for it to be a front page worthy item.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonders why raku is not really mentioned in the discussion?Then I remembered my daily mantra:  - NO_ONE cares about the community
  - WHAT_THEY_NEED is UniCode &amp; Rats
  - WHAT_THEY_LIKE is poetry (not golfing, but an expressive professional medium not desecrated by ‘public void’ line noise)
  - WHAT_THEY_KNOW is CPAN, DWIM and REGEX (the easy is easy and the hard is possible)
  - WHAT_THEY_WANT is Grammar, Functional, OO, Declarative, Concurrency, Dynamic Type … oh and Procedural done v clean
  - WHAT_THEY_HAVE is PHP, Ruby, Python, C#, Go, Perl5, ECMAScript, Java — demand for raku is pent up.

So, I detect some natural frustration within and without the community. Keep the faith. We have a new audience, they value truth and beauty, and a story of battling the odds. They need this TECHNOLOGY. It is [perl6 | raku] – who cares. It may have to start in academia, it may have to start in the p5 stalwarts. It will ignite. Finish the journey. Do not deny your heritage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42307223</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed charges against Gravy Analytics and Venntel for unlawfully selling location data that tracked consumers' movements and behaviors without their consent. The allegations highlight that the companies collected sensitive location information from mobile devices and offered it to various clients, including marketers and other businesses. The FTC's actions aim to protect consumer privacy and enforce regulations against deceptive practices related to personal data. This enforcement is part of a broader initiative to ensure accountability in the handling and sale of consumer data.&lt;/p&gt;

His contention is that this surveillance data has made NSA warrantless wiretaps old news. Cops don’t need to do the spying themselves, they can simply buy the info.I am of the opinion that at this point, Americans only believe we are less surveilled than people elsewhere. It’s not visible so people forget about it. Yet it is so deeply embedded into the government that it will never be removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42309429</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of a "special law" aimed at strengthening public security amid rising tensions with North Korea. The law allows for enhanced police powers, particularly to maintain order during protests and civil unrest. Yoon's administration aims to counter threats from North Korea, especially given its recent missile tests and aggressive rhetoric. The move has sparked debate regarding civil liberties and the balance between security and freedom, highlighting concerns over the potential for excessive government control and repression of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blizzard Entertainment has announced the discontinuation of the public testing for "Warcraft I" and "Warcraft II" as part of a broader effort to preserve classic games. The decision aligns with GOG's new preservation program aimed at ensuring older titles remain accessible. The article discusses the implications of this move for fans of the classic games, including concerns about their availability and the significance of preserving gaming history. The piece highlights Blizzard's ongoing commitment to maintaining its legacy while also addressing the challenges faced in the digital gaming landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They've also now launched the Warcraft 3 "remaster" twice, and it's still in a worse state than it was 20 years ago. First they did less than half the job, cut budget, and launched missing major features from the original project, with only some terrible new models to show that look decent up close, but bad from the overhead RTS view. Then they did a relaunch where they did lazy AI upscaling of old models and icons that don't actually look any better, added some realtime shadows that don't fit with the style of the game, and called it a "Warcraft 3 2.0".Really terrible treatment of one of the best game series of all time, and being part of Microsoft hasn't helped. It would have been nice if Warcraft 3 got the same treatment as AoE2 or AoM.I buy all games on GoG when I can, especially classic games, but new ones as well. It's so nice to just have a collection of DRM-free installers, and be able to support a company that does right by the classic games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well I bought WC2 already and have the files. That's the best part of GOG, you can just make your own backup.I think with hard copies going away, the ability to make backups of what you buy should be protected by law, at least for software that is no longer supported (of course one side effect is that all games become services, but there have been single player games recently that prove it's still a good business model).We have seen enough cases of how digital copies are ultimately a way for companies to "erase history", so to speak, and this is detrimental not just to consumers but the wider culture. Hard copies was a way to guard against this, but ultimately it is all software anyway, and digital copies should provide a way to truly own what you buy (if it's a one time buy product).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It used to be exciting when a Blizzard release was coming out. Now it's just scary and a bit depressing when they announce something. I was excited all the way up through Overwatch 1, then the WC3 remaster and Overwatch 2 were awful. If they only messed up new releases it wouldnt be so bad; it's the incessant fiddling and worsening of what was good. Even of games that weren't meant to be "live service" games.I already have WC2 on GoG and this preservation program commitment makes me think I should start ramping up buying other games from my childhood with GoG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303274</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides an analysis of the impact and influence of Y Combinator (YC) in the startup ecosystem. It discusses the success of YC-backed companies, highlighting their growth and the significant role YC plays in shaping the entrepreneurial landscape. The piece emphasizes the unique characteristics of YC's approach, including its selective application process, mentorship, and network effects, which contribute to the high success rate of participating startups. Overall, it showcases Y Combinator's importance as a catalyst for startup innovation and its enduring legacy in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This changed in the early 2010s, in part due to the emergence of the tech bubble of that decade (propped up, no doubt, by low interest rates). But it was also changed by the emergence of a new generation of rich ex-founders and early-employees — the result of the Google IPO, and also a smattering of startup acquisitions over the course of the late 1990s and 2000s. These newly rich individuals became investors, and some of these folks — such as ex-Googler and prominent angel Chris Sacca — raised small funds in the $20 million to $40 million range. This meant that the angels now had enough firepower to invest $200,000 checks instead of $20,000 checks — and early stage startups could go longer without talking to VC firms.I feel like this timeline is off. I lived in San Francisco in the first half of the 2010s and the big turning point wasn't Google's IPO but Facebook's. Cost of living was already inflated by then ($2-3k/mo for a SoMa studio) but after end of the lockout period, the property prices started to really grow out of control and the number of luxury cars driving around SF exploded. Angel groups that invested collectively as a mini-VC firm also became much more popular at that point.Googlers were plenty involved at the time but the FB IPO is when the character of the whole Bay Area seemed to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Adchemy named each of AdGrok’s co-founders personally in the suit, meaning that if they lost, the founders would be personally liable. The amounts involved in the suit effectively meant that all three co-founders would have been financially ruined.I've been there too. Named personally. I think most people don't realize how stressful and damaging this is. In most cases it's because there's some kind of well-intentioned but vaguely formulated law or act that, if real events are twisted by just the right amounts, would apply and imply personal liability.From that point on the game that the litigators play is to try and shoehorn each and every of your past statements or actions to fit the law in question and your job is to find as much evidence to the contrary, which might go many years back. In records that you almost certainly no longer have. While running a company.This practice of putting founders personally in a lawsuit is an absolute disgrace and it needs to stop. The damage done by vague laws and litigators who ruthlessly exploit them are a very large multiple higher than any of the benefits that could possibly be derived from them. The only winners in this game are the law firms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; &gt; Y Combinator was the sort of unforgiving power player that remembered the names of investors who had crossed portfolio companies in the past, or who had disseminated unflattering portraits of YC, and blacklisted them from any YC dealings, or from the minds of YC founders.Do we have to be careful what we say on HN?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303798</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, I saw this link and immediately thought, "I bet the discussion will be about how we should use N100s, instead." I wasn't disappointed. Even on dedicated Pi forums, you see that happening.I guess I understand this point of view if you were trying to use Pis to experiment with Kubernetes or something. You'd have built your own (desktop) PC or a personal server rack for that kind of thing, years ago. But for the vast majority of typical uses (Home Assistant, VPNs, etc.) a Pi is going to be way more than you need. It will sit there and silently and reliably run, for years at a time, powered by a USB cable. I know mine have.Why would I consider replacing those with a bigger box, fan noise and a power brick? Maybe I'm missing something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, but why bother. Pi's were great when they were cheap, but one can get a better performing Intel N100 box for a similar price and power consumption now.The only reason I can think of to use a Pi is GPIO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tried the SDRAM tweak and got myself a respectable 10% speedup with LLMs. Hat tip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303111</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone who has built multiple custom macro film scanner setups, owns basically very consumer film scanner of note (including the Coolscan 9000 and the Minolta Scan Multi Pro), and is intimately familiar with the workings of various film scanners and science of digitizing film, I don't think this article provides particularly good advice.Just for instance, the LS-2000 features in the post has an advertised optical resolution of 2700DPI, which means the absolute maximum megapixel resolution you can get out of that thing is a little over 10MP. Film scanners are notorious for overstating their optical resolution, which has nothing to do with the resolution of sensor used to digitize the image data and everything to do with the lens in the scanner. You can have a 200MP sensor scanning your film but if your lens can only resolve 1000DPI you will have a very high resolution image of a low resolution lens projection. It's maybe a little better than a flatbed and it features dust removal, but in the year of our lord 2024 the LS-2000 is not a good choice for scanning film.As for his macro scanning setup, he appears to be using the digitaliza for film holding, which is a notoriously bad product with many known flaws. Negative supply makes a line of lower cost version of their very good film holders, and Valoi also offers an affordable system of components that I highly recommend. There is a ton of good information out there about macro scanning, and had the OP sought it out he could avoided his little adventure in retro computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Got to shout out to VueScan for making obsolete scanners usable on modern operating systems. It's not free, but is reasonably priced. If you can physically connect your scanner (scsi2usb is an exercise left to the reader), then it's likely to let you use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been using a Coolscan 8000 and a 2007 iMac for 17 years (prior to that, I used a Mac Mini for a short while) and only last year had to replace the scanner motherboard after an international move. To continue to use Nikon's software, the iMac is still on 10.6 Snow Leopard.I shoot 35mm and medium format and the Coolscan pulls extraordinary detail from the negatives - vastly better than the best flatbed scanners I've ever used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308234</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen this over and over. One of the main issues pointed out by TFA is that there's too many small tasks allocated for parallel execution. Rayon is not going to magically distribute your work perfectly, though it very often does a decent job.If your algorithm is the equivalent of a couple of nested iterations, you have essentially three options: parallelize outer, inner, or both. In the vast majority of the cases I've run into, you want thread/task level parallelism on the outer loop (only), and if required, data/simd parallelism on the inner loop(s).It's a rule of thumb, but it biases towards batches of work assigned to CPUs for a decent amount of time, allowing cache locality and pipelining to kick in. That's even before SIMD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused by the before / after graph, this is how I'm reading the graphs:The "before" graph shows a ~300ms wall-clock time which drops to ~150ms parallelised.The "after" graph shows a ~27ms wall-clock time which drops to ~17ms when parallelised.Isn't all the improvement still outside of the parallelisation then? There's an awful lot of discussion about parallelisation and the behaviour of schedulers given there wasn't any improvement of how parallelisable the end result was?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per the article's "Using the right profiling tools", I have gone through a similar profiling journey in Rust and found this tool very useful: https://superluminal.eu/rust/Works on Windows, has a great GUI, shows pretty flame charts, really pleasant to use. Costs money but worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42278003</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Curse of Markdown" discusses the limitations and challenges associated with using Markdown as a markup language for writing and formatting text. It highlights issues such as inconsistencies in Markdown implementations across different platforms, lack of advanced formatting options, and difficulties in handling complex layouts. The author argues that while Markdown is popular for its simplicity, it can lead to frustrations for users who seek to create more sophisticated documents. Ultimately, the piece advocates for the exploration of alternative solutions or enhancements to Markdown to better meet users' needs in various writing contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't see any gulf or sudden jump in cost. Don't be a Markdown purist. Even John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, is not a Markdown purist. Go look at the Markdown source of his blog and you will see that he frequently just uses raw HTML. He doesn't even do multi-paragraph ordered lists in Markdown, and chooses to write &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; instead. And he also uses &lt;a&gt;&lt;img&gt; for clickable images. You can append ".text" to any of his blog article to get the Markdown source; example https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The impact of Markdown becomes clear if we plot a random sample of content websites. (Disclaimer: the data is made-up, based on my perception of the state of the web)It makes sense that your perception of the web has driven you to create a new tool and market it with a think piece.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Perfect Pitch" explores the concept of perfect pitch, or absolute pitch, which is the ability to identify or recreate a musical note without a reference tone. It discusses the implications of this skill in music education, cognitive science, and the nature of musical talent. The author delves into the debate over whether perfect pitch is an innate ability or can be developed through training, while also highlighting the experiences of individuals with perfect pitch and the societal perceptions surrounding this rare ability. The essay ultimately reflects on how perfect pitch relates to broader themes of perception, learning, and artistic expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suppose I have perfect pitch, in that I can more often than not:  * aurally identify key signatures
  * aurally identify chords
  * sing a given note on command

It wasn't until I was into my early twenties that I could do this. For me, the single biggest stepping stone was building the connection between what I could hear in my head from a song that I remember clearly with the underlying music theory.Specifically, building up a library of knowledge regarding the key signature of songs I liked:  * Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" is in B minor
  * The famous motif in Beethoven's 5th is in C minor
  * Blues Traveller's "Hook" is in A
  * Regina Spektor's "Eet" is in D-flat
  * Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is F minor
  * etc.

Then, make connections based upon that. Want to sing a B? Just recall the opening, sustained keyboard chord in "Comfortably Numb". Huh, The Beatles "Across The Universe" sounds tonally like "Eet" - I guess it is also in D-flat.A simple way to do this is to make playlists for a given key, which helps reinforce the sense of shared tonality across songs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolute pitch: a completely useless skill, which having can in some cases even be detrimental. While being very hard to impossible to acquire. So naturally I will stop at nothing trying to develop it :)A couple of months ago, this paper made the rounds: Absolute pitch in involuntary musical imagery [0]. In a small sample group, nearly half the time (44.7%) when someone was asked to sing their current earworm, were they perfectly in pitch. Random chance would be 8.3%.It’s a fun thing to try for yourself. Just hum your current earworm into a voice memo, and check the correct pitch against the recording of the original song. You may discover a skill you never knew you had, implicit perfect pitch on involuntary music!Trying to make this more interesting, reproducing a particular song on demand (there’s references to that too in the paper - it also works better than random chance, but less so than the involuntary kind), I find it works best for songs that start off with a single note, preferably sung. Or then at least you can immediately check whether you were right, e.g. “Tom’s Diner”. I’ve been having a lot of fun humming the first tone to Laufey’s cover of Sunny side of the street [1] whenever I open YouTube. I’m more often right than wrong, and if I was wrong, I can just listen to the whole thing to brighten my day anyways.[0]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-024-02936-0[1]: https://youtu.be/wK6gbKC90Ps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this article is more of a "Here's all the things I think about perfect pitch and my journey with music"Maybe I took the title too literally.As someone who wants to gain perfect pitch (and still feels mildly distant from this ability) one thing I can say has been the most helpful:* Get a string instrument* Strum the strings* Try to tune the first string by ear* Once you think you have it, check it against a chromatic tuner.This way will you see how progressively your feeling of "in tune" can be measured in hertz.I can get pretty pretty close (within about 5hz).I used to have competitions with my children on who could get the note closest without a tuner. One of my kids got pretty good where they could almost nail it within 1 hz. It made things fun and a little less "maintenance".The best way I can describe the process is you have a sensitivity to a threshold of being in tune. I hear the note but there is something inside myself, it almost feels like anxiousness that kinda peaks right before I hit the note and then stops when I "feel" I've hit that note I'm aiming for. As I've said, I can get within about 5hz which to a musician they can probably notice it is off but for the average ear, it feels muddy but close.Long story short, practice with a tuner and within a year you'll surprise yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42250701</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how the grounds of an English castle transformed into a thriving habitat for storks, leading to a significant revival of the species in the region. It discusses the restoration efforts undertaken to create a suitable environment for the birds, highlighting the importance of conservation and habitat management. The piece delves into the ecological and cultural significance of this resurgence, illustrating how human intervention can positively impact wildlife and contribute to biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Polish countryside pretty much every village has several frames for storks to build their nests on. People build them on their roofs or on utility poles, and some utility companies do that too. It's best to build it a meter or more over the base to protect the nest from predators and electricity.http://dbajobociany.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/naprawa-gn...https://e-magazyny.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bocian-slup...https://ipla.pluscdn.pl/dituel/cp/wo/wo139es6nx2b9jxcrg8a521...Also I've never seen a stork feeding in a swamp as they wrote in this article, but I've seen plenty of times storks walking behind a tractor plowing a field. They wait for the farmer to dig up the ground and eat the larva of insects uncovered by the tractors.They also catch frogs and mice on regular fields. Don't need to be a bog. That's probably why farmers love them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a great film about the Knepp rewilding project - https://www.wildingmovie.com/ - which this article is about. I found it very inspiring.There are also a couple of books:https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/wilding-the-return-of-nature...https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-wilding-a-practi...And if anyone lives nearby (Sussex, UK) and wants to get involved in something like this, the Sussex Wildlife Trust are almost always looking for volunteers: https://sussexwildlifetrust.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer Once you get into volunteering for SWT you'll hear about opportunities to volunteer on lots of other projects like Weald to Waves - https://www.wealdtowaves.co.uk/ - and Knepp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This story is such a cool example of how rewilding can really work. Turning the land from intensive farming into a more natural space gave the storks exactly what they needed to thrive—and it’s amazing to see them breeding there for the first time in centuries!It makes me wonder what other places could do if they rethought how land is used. Projects like this don’t just help wildlife but also bring life and energy back to these areas. Plus, it’s such a great blend of preserving history and building something new for the future. Would love to see more efforts like this popping up around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231580</guid></item><item><title>32.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did a quick search for "hair" since in my experience the most obnoxious part of using a traditional EEG cap was having to rinse the gel out of my hair in the sink afterwards (I was in a research study and had to do this multiple times a month, right before heading to class. Always left me looking disheveled). It looks like this approach works better for slightly hairy skin (the person in most of these figures has a buzz cut) than other e-tattoo methods but they do note:&gt; More work is needed to scan and print on heads with long and thick hairs. Highlighting the persistent issue of racial bias in neuroscience research is crucial, as traditional EEG electrodes are often unreliable on individuals of African descent, resulting in suboptimal patient experiences and outcomes in clinical settings.69,70 Curly hairs tend to push against the EEG cap, reducing contact between the electrodes and the scalp, leading to a poor contact impedance.71 Developing on-scalp digital printing for different hair types should prioritize bridging this important gap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cool research.drop robot.use paint brushUSA space pen vs USSR pencil situation.question:does the thicness of the material effect conductivity?

What we need is to move to more formal languages to replace the ambiguity of natural language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one thing i personally admire/appreciate about simonw's work is how beautifully his tools, services and research "stacks" to unlock higher and higher levels of abstraction. so many of the little one-off scraper/notifier/transformer repos on his github showcase the amazing composability of the tooling he built previously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DuckDB is a more convenient and performant tool for analyzing large CSV/JSON files. Shameless plug: if you’re interested in combining DuckDB with Claude using the recently announced Model Context Protocol (MCP), check out the MyDuck Server project (https://github.com/apecloud/myduckserver) that I’m working on. You can follow this guide https://github.com/apecloud/myduckserver/blob/main/docs/tuto... to get started.

It's deeply in my mental zone of "undefined behavior, I don't even have an intuition about what to do."One of the more fun programming projects I ever worked on was a custom text editor. Mainly it supported rich annotations that could be applied to any chosen term or stretch of text. It used Mobiledoc[1] which already provided pretty well-developed primitives for rich text editing on the web, and it was still a complicated project, even with a solid framework.[1] https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:Text editing hates you too (2019) - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27236874 - May 2021 (182 comments)Text Editing Hates You Too - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21384158 - Oct 2019 (282 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even "simple" interfaces–popovers, date pickers–inevitably become spiralling fractals of complexity, each layer folding into another the longer you look at them.

&lt;p&gt;A company has reported that a drastic 1000% increase in pricing by VMware forced them to switch to an open-source alternative for their virtualization needs. This shift highlights the financial pressures that can lead organizations to reconsider their technology partnerships, as firms seek more sustainable and cost-effective solutions in a competitive market. The article discusses the implications of such pricing strategies on customer loyalty and the growing appeal of open-source technologies in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We (Red Hat) are doing great business moving customers off VMware.  20,000 VMs is not an unusual amount for our larger customers.  I did a 5 min lightning talk in summer about this: https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/SN93LG/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broadcoms policy seems to be to aim for the larger customers where a 10x price rise for a suite of products isn't an issue.  Charging 10x the price to 10% of your customers isn't necessarily a bad strategy for a business.6 months ago on HN:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40452260&gt; Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND research, told The Register that VMware by Broadcom is “laser focused on high-revenue, high-margin business” and has priced its wares “just below the pain threshold for customers they care about.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So many people misunderstand what is actually happening.Broadcom aren't hiking the price 10x for everyone.If you previously used:  - VMWare Vsphere

  - Cloudify Automation 

  - CISCO ASI Software Defined Network

  - Splunk log collection

  - Nutanix Acropolis Distributed Storage

  - etc..


Then you're going to see you vSphere costs jump massively because you're only option to buy vSphere now also comes with:  - VMWare Vsphere

  - VMWare Aria Automation

  - VMWare NSX Software Defined Network

  - VMWare Log Insight

  - VMWare vSan

  - etc..

So, if you're already heavily invested in VMWare, you might even see your costs reduce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42304955</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Aurora with the Data API is a serverless database option designed to simplify interactions with databases by allowing developers to execute SQL commands via HTTP requests. It eliminates the need for connection management and is ideal for applications that require scalable database access, such as microservices. The Data API supports JSON format for request and response, facilitating seamless integration with modern development environments. Key benefits include automatic scaling, built-in security features, and the ability to connect from various programming languages without the overhead of managing database connections.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can Amazon please get RDS product management ducks in a row? You got RDS For PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL (provisioned), Aurora Serverless v1, Aurora Serverless v2, Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database, Aurora Global Database, and now Aurora DSQL (with PostgreSQL compatibility). It's very confusing, the docs are confusing, and the even the tools are confused.I think this is pretty big contrast to something like S3 where the product feels far more clearly and coherently managed, and where they have released lots of big improvements/changes over the years without disrupting or muddying the core product in major ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just tried a quick test cluster -  Identifies as PG 16.5
  No views/triggers/sequences
  No foreign key constraints
  No extensions
  No NOTIFY ("ERROR:  Function pg_notify not supported")
  No nested transactions

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses issues with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bus cameras, which have incorrectly recorded parking violations, unfairly penalizing drivers. It details how the cameras intended to enforce bus lane regulations have instead led to numerous complaints and mistakes, resulting in erroneous tickets and fines for drivers who were not violating any laws. The investigation highlights the need for better technology and oversight to prevent such errors in the future, emphasizing the impact on both bus service and motorists.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I lived in California years ago I had a custom 2-letter plate. I gave the car to a relative who switched its registration to another state.Years later, I got a toll demand from an express lane around LA that had a false positive scan of my plate number—someone else’s partially obscured maybe?I argued the car was registered elsewhere and wasn’t driven in CA, and they denied the appeal.  I asked for evidence but they refused. I tried a FOIA request but it was denied because there’s an exemption for data that reveals individuals’ driving patterns—to get the photo I would have had to show up at an office in LA to show my ID and registration to prove it was my car, which it wasn’t!CA law allows the plate scanning and dictates the toll violation letter must show the make and model of the vehicle in question. They just look up the DMV records for the scanned plate. They’re not doing any kind of verification that the vehicle matches. They have 100% faith in the infallibility of these scanners with no appeals process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some years back Santa Cruz updated the meter maids / parking enforcement to GPS enabled smart devices and they would still drive around, get out, take pictures (when someone was in violation).  My wife and I were sitting outside a restaurant where such a vehicle was being photo'd.  This particular meter person was known to be .. not nice.  While said person was behind vehicle (old vw bus) and out of site of the meter, we slipped a couple of quarters in and got back to our seat.Watching the reaction (they already had a couple of photos) was priceless.  Said person questioned about 3 different groups (myself included) and all played dumb and had a good laugh when done.  The vehicle owner saw the interaction from the farmer's market across the way and bought a round for a couple of tables.Santa Cruz has a history of meter scofflawism - https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/mr-twister-s-mission-of-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the "A.I." in the headline, the source of the errors seems to be bad categorical data input and nothing AI related. The same problem likely could've happened with human traffic enforcement if they were given the wrong instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308682</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned C by running a MUD — a DikuMUD derivative. I was in high school, in the 90s, and I didn't know any programmers in my town who could teach me how to really code. My high school computer science teacher didn't know.What I loved about the MUD as a learning environment was the players. On a busy night we'd have over a hundred people playing. So, I got to cut my teeth on a real, live production system with actual users. That motivated me. There were mild consequences if I broke things. And, if I made things better for the players, it felt good.For me, this environment was so much better than doing programming problem sets by myself, writing code that no one would ever use.https://tashian.com/articles/how-i-learned-to-program/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MUDs are how I began programming, about 30 years ago at the age of 16.  Now I'm a senior engineer making mobile games.  Unsurprisingly I focus on the backend.MUDs taught me C, devops, multiplayer/sockets, security to some extent, databases (I wrote my own MUD that used MySQL).  Also HTML/webpages eventually.  MUDs taught me the full stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The good old days when you could just hook up some hacked up C code to the internet and pray you caught all the potential exploits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243751</guid></item><item><title>45.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! This is a blog post sharing some low-level Linux networking we're doing at Modal with WireGuard.As a serverless platform we hit a bit of a tricky tradeoff: we run multi-tenant user workloads on machines around the world, and each serverless function is an autoscaling container pool. How do you let users give their functions static IPs, but also decouple them from compute resource flexibility?We needed a high-availability VPN proxy for containers and didn't find one, so we built our own on top of WireGuard and open-sourced it at https://github.com/modal-labs/vproxLet us know if you have thoughts! I'm relatively new to low-level container networking, and we (me + my coworkers Luis and Jeffrey + others) have enjoyed working on this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is a really neat writeup! the design choice to make each "exit node" control the local wireguard connections instead of a global control plane is pretty neat.an unfinished project I worked on (https://github.com/redpwn/rvpn) was a bit more ambitious with a global control plane and I quickly learned supporting multiple clients especially anything networking related is a tarpit. the focus on linux / aws specifically here and the results achievable from it are nice to see.networking is challenging and this was a nice deep dive into some networking internals, thanks for sharing the details :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing. This new feature is neat! It might sound a bit out there, but here's a thought: could you enable assigning unique IP addresses to different serverless instances? For certain use cases, like web scraping, it's helpful to simulate requests coming from multiple locations instead of just one. I think allowing requests to originate from a pool of IP addresses would be doable given this proxy model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299829</guid></item><item><title>47. .NET Support on Heroku</title><link>https://blog.heroku.com/dotnet-support-on-heroku</link><description>

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heroku is still probably the platform that offers the most well built-out "here's all your operational needs for the first N years of your business" system, without causing you to have to deal with a billion concepts.I have found Heroku to be going downhill a lot, but after moving away from it I often feel a bit of regret from this decision. You get _so much_ operational niceness out of the box with Heroku.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huh, this wasn't supported already? Wonder why they decided it was finally time to take the 30 minutes to create an official .NET buildpak now vs 10 years ago when it became cross-platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who's using Heroku these days? The rug pull they managed back in the day akin to Travis ought to have lost them any goodwill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42301734</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ernest Davis has an outstanding and definitive rebuttal of these claims: https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/papers/GPT-Poetry.pdfThe basic problem is that GPT generates easy poetry, and the authors were comparing to difficult human poets like Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and rating using a bunch of people who don't particuarly like poetry. If you actually do like poetry, comparing PlathGPT to Sylvia Plath is so offensive as to be misanthropic: the human Sylvia Plath is objectively better by any possible honest measure. I don't think the authors have any interest in being honest: ignorance is no excuse for something like this.Given the audience, it would be much more honest if the authors compared with popular poets, like Robert Frost, whose work is sophisticated but approachable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poetry, like humor, involves the use of the reader's expectations, but is typically most effective when subverting those expectations.There's a lot of bad poetry in the world that just follows readers' expectations. I should know, I've written some of it. Unfortunately, I'd suspect that most readers' understanding of poetry lacks that crucial element of subversion, and so an LLM – which mostly just spits out the most-probable, most-expected next token – looks like what people think poetry is.An LLM would not have created the curtal sonnet form, because it would've been too busy following the rules of a Shakespearean or Petrarchan sonnet. Similarly, an LLM wouldn't create something that intentionally breaks the pattern of a form in order to convey a sense of brokenness or out-of-place-ness, because it's too locked in on the most-common-denominator from previous inputs. And yet, many of the most powerful works I've read are the ones that can convey a disjointed feeling on purpose – something an LLM is specifically geared not to do.Poetry aims for the heart, and catches the mind along the way. An LLM does not have the requisite complex emotional intelligence, and is indeed a pretty poor simulation of emotional intelligence.Consider Auden's Epitaph on a Tyrant, which is powerful because it is so suddenly shocking, as it describes something that sounds perhaps like an artist or author, until it very suddenly doesn't, on the last line:    Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after,
    and the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
    he knew human folly like the back of his hand,
    and was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
    when he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
    and when he cried the little children died in the streets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The program Racter (which, from what I understand, was a basic MDP) was generating poetry in the 1980s that was published, read, criticized, and presented in museums: https://www.101bananas.com/poems/racter.htmlI remember this as one of its poems was used on on the t-shirts of the computing social club that I was part of as a postgrad student:  More than iron
  More than lead
  More than gold I need electricity
  I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber
  I need it for my dreams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42306857</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses DatoCMS's decision to switch their documentation and blog to Astro, a modern static site generator. The team highlights Astro's advantages, including improved performance, optimized loading speeds, and enhanced developer experience. They emphasize the benefits of using components from various frameworks, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency in building web content. The switch is presented as a strategic move to create a more maintainable and faster web experience for users while leveraging the latest advancements in web technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really like Astro:1. It's the most flexible yet easily configured static site generator I've used to date2. It's reliable. The docs are well maintained and, mirabile dictu, the real behavior of the system matches its documented behavior3. It's stable. Lots of new features are getting added, but (so far) upgrades don't break things4. It has good tooling for editors like vscode5. Many of my current projects take the form of "big data pipeline, followed by intermittent job to rebuild a static site and push it live"; astro fits very nicely in this roleCaveat: I use exactly none of Astro's backend features. I understand why they've added them but, for me, it's all about static site generation.About the only thing I don't like is the weirdness of the boundary between astro components and framework components. I get it, but still. It's something to carefully consider when building each new astro site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For all of the JavaScript frameworks/libraries/toolchains that were supposed to solve front-end development woes, we could have had a language that actually did that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can relate to the complexity fatigue.I think if they were willing to let go of type safety, PHP + jQuery could unironically work just fine for them. I wonder if it's possible to sanely use PHP with TypeScript + Vite with SSG, without making your tooling too complex.Anyway, congrats to them, sounds like they reduced costs and even kept engineers happy with an interesting technical challenge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42306742</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are not the only ones. The company I work for uses a LOT of VMware. Mind you, VMWare has ALWAYS been expensive. To the point that in a lot of cases, you can end up spending more on VMWare than the hardware that runs it. I long ago crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion that unless your workload really does require the kind of exceptional storage, networking, and HA integration that VMware (claims to) provide, you are better off using an open source solution for your VM infra and hiring a couple of extra engineers to manage it.When it was time for our contract to renew a few months back, our licensing and support quote was 3x the previous year and Broadcom would not budge, even a little. They said take it or leave it. Well, we left it.There is a big internal effort now to get us off of VMware and onto Kubernetes and OpenShift. Our whole fleet of VMware is still running but we're on borrowed time as we're on our own if any major technical issue comes up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My $dayjob is freaking out about the new cost of VMware.I suspect Broadcom's plan is to figure out just how much they can bear and cut a deal along those lines.That would totally work -- we're neck deep in vmware, and there's no easy way out -- except that there's a kind of network effect at play.Support is huge for us. In the beginning, we developed expertise in vmware (particularly in regard to our products), and guided our customers to it as well. Customers were happy to follow our recommended/supported option, and we were happy supporting it. (The support ain't cheap!)But our customers, by-and-large, are smaller and somewhat more nimble, meaning many will be unable or unwilling to do a deal with broadcom, and will insist on switching away. I suspect new customers will lead the way... there's no way we're going to walk away from a deal because the customer refuses to pay for vmware, and we probably can't afford to eat that cost for them. So we're going to start gaining expertise and supporting other vm platforms. I think we'll follow our original pattern: settle on one, gain expertise, start using it in support, then test and dev, and steer our customers to it. At some point we'll realize we know how to get rid of the rest of our internal use of vmware, AND realize we can sell remaining customers support to switch away from vmware themselves. Once that happens, I think it becomes a ball rolling down hill, and things will accelerate quickly.There are a couple reasons this isn't like Oracle, BTW. For one, with Oracle we're 10,000 ft below the surface with Oracle-provided air tanks. Second (I guess this is the main thing), Oracle is our problem, not our customers'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to wonder if stuff like this will, over time, force companies to be extremely wary of any tech that eventually falls into the "extremely difficult to remove" category, and have companies instead requiring open source solutions and then separate contracts with support companies for those solutions.It's just further re-emphasizing that it doesn't matter how good your vendor is now, they will probably eventually get acquired by a company attempting to squeeze every last penny out of you. And their cost-benefit calculation is no longer based on how much unique value the software is providing, but it's instead about how much of a PITA it is to migrate off said software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308184</guid></item><item><title>1.

I came across one with zero views, and there's something so intimate and exciting about being the first person to watch an ancient home video (even if it's shaky handycam footage of a horse, narrated in Russian).As an aside, hats off to Google to being able to serve an 11 year old video with no noticeable delay from what must be the coldest of caches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's like TikTok sans algorithm. I got a protest in Vietnam, a rally for French politician François Hollande, a dad making his daughter laugh, hockey practice, a farmer driving a truck, a guy impressing his girlfriend with his new subwoofer.This is so raw and human, I love it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent and related:IMG_0416 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102506 - Nov 2024 (324 comments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314547</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is.. super impressive. I'd like to know how large this model is. I note that the first thing they have it do is talk to agents who can control the world gen; geez - even robots get to play video games while we work.That said; I cannot find any:- architecture explanation- code- technical details- API access informationFeels very DeepMind / 2015, and that's a bummer. I think the point of the "we have no moat" email has been taken to heart at Google, and they continue to be on the path of great demos, bleh product launches two years later, and no open access in the interim.That said, just knowing this is possible - world navigation based on a photo and a text description with up to a minute of held context -- is amazing, and I believe will inspire some groups out there to put out open versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting to me that we continue to see such pressure on video and world generation, despite the fact that for years now we’ve gotten games and movies that have beautiful worlds filled with lousy, limited, poorly written stories. Star Wars movies have looked phenomenal for a decade, full of bland stories we’ve all heard a thousand times.Are there any game developers working on infinite story games? I don’t care if it looks like Minecraft, I want a Minecraft that tells intriguing stories with infinite quest generation. Procedural infinite world gen recharged gaming, where is the procedural infinite story generation?Still, awesome demo. I imagine by the time my kids are in their prime video game age (another 5 years or so) we will be in a new golden age of interactive story telling.Hey siri, tell me the epic of Gilgamesh over 40 hours of gameplay set 50,000 years in the future where genetic engineering has become trivial and Enkidu is a child’s creation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget video games. This is a huge step forward for AGI and Robotics. There's a lot of evidence from Neurobiology that we must be running something like this in our brains--things like optical illusions, the editing out of our visual blind spot, the relatively low bandwidth measured in neural signals from our senses to our brain, hallucinations, our ability to visualize 3d shapes, to dream. This is the start of adding all those abilities to our machines. Low bandwidth telepresence rigs. Subatomic VR environments synthesized from particle accelerator data. Glasses that make the world 20% more pleasant to look at. Schizophrenic automobiles. One day a power surge is going to fry your doorbell camera and it'll start tripping balls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317903</guid></item><item><title>3.

The teenagers spent two hours a week in online classes and after eight weeks were given a test using questions from an Oxford postgraduate quantum physics exam. More than 80% of the pupils passed and around half earned a distinction. Were you surprised by their success?At one point, I was going to call off the whole thing because I thought it was going to be a complete disaster. We’d originally wanted the kids to interact with each other on social media or communicate online, but that wasn’t allowed due to the ethical guidelines for the experiment. I thought, what sort of educational experience is it, if you can’t talk to each other?This is the Covid generation: none of them put their cameras on [for the online classes], so we were looking at a black screen. None of them asked questions using their voices, they just typed. It was a difficult teaching challenge by all standards. We also saw a self-esteem problem with the students. But the majority of kids liked that we had announced that you didn’t need a complex maths background. The maths had been a barrier to kids who had wanted to access this knowledge.And then we got back the numbers. They did significantly better than we see from university-level students. Exams were marked blind, so we don’t know how many came in with the aim of pursuing Stem. We are processing that data now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is many years since I visited CERN, but I really enjoyed my time there.  One of the scientists was wandering around the visitor center willing to chat about the science at a quite detailed level.Programs like this education experiment are essential to maintain interest in these big science projects that can take decades of planning and execution.  A sliver of hope for humanity that we are still willing to collaborate on such a massive scale to deliver and run such projects.Well done everyone, apart from the person that decided the home of the internet was not capable of self hosting the videos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's only 4 hours? I expected it to be longer, even for an introductory course.Anyway, it's a great effort! And it makes me happy to see how seriously they take it.Since I have near 0 knowledge in the matter, I might actually take it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314340</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses strategies for optimizing Ruby applications to improve their performance. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the common bottlenecks in Ruby code and provides various techniques for enhancing speed, such as minimizing object allocations, using efficient algorithms, and leveraging built-in methods. Additionally, it suggests profiling applications to identify specific areas that require improvement and highlights tools and resources that can aid developers in speeding up their Ruby code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Python was the slowest language in the benchmark, and yet at the same time it’s the most used language on Github as of October 2024.Interesting that there seems to be a correlation between a language being slow and it being popular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FTA: The loop example iterates 1 billion times, utilizing a nested loop:  u = ARGV[0].to_i       
  r = rand(10_000)                          
  a = Array.new(10_000, 0)                 
 
  (0...10_000).each do |i|                     
    (0...100_000).each do |j|               
      a[i] += j % u                     
    end
    a[i] += r                      
  end
 
  puts a[r]

Weird benchmark. Hand-optimized, I guess this benchmark will spend over 99% of its time in the first two lines.If you do liveliness analysis on array elements you’ll discover that it is possible to remove the entire outer loop, turning the program into:  u = ARGV[0].to_i       
  r = rand(10_000)                                         
                    
  (0...100_000).each do |j|               
    a += j % u                     
  end
  a += r                      
  
  puts a

Are there compilers that do this kind of analysis?Even though u isn’t known at compile time, that inner loop can be replaced by a few instructions, too, but that’s a more standard optimization that, I suspect, the likes of clang may be close to making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After all these years, I still love Ruby. Thank you Matz!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42316799</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the practical side of things, one important behavior that I see people frequently forget is the importance of following up. This is probably the biggest differentiator between relationships that languish in the early stages, versus those that progress along the author’s continuum.It’s always a bit strange when you only hear from people once every few years, just as they need an intro or career advice or whatever- the beginning of those conversations is usually a bit of sheepish catch-up on what happened after you last spoke with them. Similarly, there have been times when I have felt like a dope after realizing that I failed to follow up myself after a call, and am again reaching out for another reason.However, when you follow up with someone as simple as “Thanks for connecting me with so and so, we had a great chat” or “I tried that thing you suggested, here’s how it worked out”, you build mutual trust and enthusiasm for a successful outcome to the conversation you had. It’s a genuine and thoughtful way to grow your relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly every professional 'relationship' I've had has been transient after you stop working with them, with people completely failing to reciprocate even after multiple attempts to reach out.From talking to people I know that this experience is not unique to me, this appears to be the norm, may be it's the industry I work in : software development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abandoning lost causes can be one of the toughest but most freeing decisions in relationships. I once worked with a colleague who seemed completely resistant to collaboration. No matter how much I tried to engage or find common ground, they kept shutting down any attempt at teamwork. But one day, I realized I was investing so much energy into something that wasn’t going anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42315946</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article tells the story of "Rogue," a notorious ship in Norway's maritime history. It details its journey, including incidents of piracy and notable encounters with other ships. The narrative highlights the significance of Rogue's adventures in the context of Norway's seafaring past, examining themes of exploration, conflict, and the challenges faced by sailors during that era. The piece provides historical insights and underscores the ship's impact on local maritime lore.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rogue is a very cool game, but what get me into the genre is Angband and Nethack.I played them with ascci tiles on my computer at the french university in 2002-2004 and my classmates where all playing Warcraft 3, Diablo or Call of Duty and they where very confused to see my little games!I think that ascii characters are a good interface for this kind of game because the brain has to work to imagine the game which makes the memories of games more memorable.I still play Nethack some times and I must try Brogue. I never had the time to get into Dwarf Fortress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Rogue reached Caltech in the '80s it quickly became so popular that it got banned during the daytime so people doing real work could use the computers.The version of Rogue then was quite a bit harder than later versions and it was almost unheard of for anyone to actually get the amulet and get back out. Then this one student started regularly making the high score list, and soon had pushed everyone else off. Then he got the amulet and got out. Then he did that enough time to have the high score list full of games where he got the amulet.Then he stopped playing, until someone else would get on the high score list. Then he'd come to the computer center and play for maybe a half hour until he'd pushed them off the high score list.This was driving everyone else completely nuts because he was, as mentioned, playing in the computer center. The way the terminals were arranged there was no privacy. Everyone else could watch him play, but no one could figure out why he did so much better than the rest of us.He eventually explained it. He didn't actually do any one thing significantly better than the rest of us. For any given thing he was just slightly better. But he was slighted better at many things and that added up.For example if most people were coming back through a room they had passed through the other way earlier they would take the most convenient route between the doors. That generally would not be simply the reverse of the route they had taken the first time through, because the first time they were exploring the room.He on the other hand would take a route that only involved stepping places where he had stepped the first time through. That way he never sprung any new traps on the way back, unlike people who stepped in new places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of traditional roguelikes, Caves of Qud is getting its 1.0 release tomorrow.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phoenix creator here – excited to finally have shipped this! Happy to answer any elixir/phoenix/liveview questions.In case folks missed it, buried in the blog post is a new installer that lets folks try out elixir/phoenix in seconds. It installs elixir and generates a new phoenix project from a single command:osx/linux:    $ curl https://new.phoenixframework.org/yourappname | sh

windows powershell:    &gt; curl.exe -fsSO https://new.phoenixframework.org/app.bat; .\app.bat

You can visit those url's directly to see what the scripts do. It extends the official elixir prebuilt installers: https://elixir-lang.org/install.sh and
https://elixir-lang.org/install.batedit: You can see it in action here:
https://x.com/chris_mccord/status/1864067247255306332Of course we also have non |sh installation guides if that's what you're after:
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.htmlNow that this is out, I'm looking forward to put together a few new demos. What would folks like to see? Happy hacking!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've built many production apps using LiveView. It has some limitations inherent to its design, namely the need to have a semi-reliable WebSocket connection to be able to effectively use the app, but with this tradeoff come a number of advantages:  - code generation makes for an extremely productive experience that makes standing up an actually-useful application very fast
  - Elixir is a great language, especially for the web, and using it to render the frontend feels like having the full power of the language plus the simplicity of HTML (with little/no writing JavaScript)
  - it's extremely efficient since only tiny changes are sent over the WebSocket when data is updated on the server
  - you're already using WebSockets, so adding any kind of real-time functionality is very easy (chat, notifications, game state)

Because of the separation of concerns by convention (i.e. keeping business logic in Contexts), it's also a very viable pathway to build a webapp using LiveView first, and serve an API once you need other types of clients (native apps, API consumers) with minimal changes. Ecto is also great to use for validations, and having that available for "frontend" code is a pleasure. It's also great to be able to have backend and frontend tests in Elixir.We've hit some bugs and gotchas over the years leading up to this 1.0 release, but it has long felt like a stable, well-built library that keeps our codebases simple and maintainable, which lets you move fast.Congratulations to Chris, Jose, and all the other wonderful contributors!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now there’s some good news!I’ve been using LiveView for years now and couldn’t be happier with it. It’s a joy to work with, and has reinvigorated my love of web development. I’m so blazingly productive in LV it’s unreal.I try not to be too self-promoey on HN but this feels like as good as time as any: if this v1.0.0 release makes you want to finally learn LiveView, I humbly recommend my own course at http://learnphoenixliveview.com. Get 20% off with the code HACKERNEWS.I struggled to find good learning materials when I was starting out, so I’ve tried to rectify that problem. I hope that I can get more people over the initial learning curve because as far as I’m concerned, the more people get familiar with this awesome framework, the more everybody wins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312301</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "30cc" provides a lightweight and customizable framework for creating command-line applications in C++. It emphasizes simplicity and efficiency while offering key features such as easy command parsing, argument handling, and integration with other libraries. The project is designed to help developers quickly build robust CLI tools by providing a set of pre-defined functionalities and clear documentation for easier implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool, congratulations!I took a 2-second peek at the code, and just wanted to offer a small piece of advice that I think makes it better. Or two, really. Counting is hard.Instead of (this is from parser.c):    apply_result *ret = (apply_result*)malloc(sizeof(apply_result));

apply the two common principles of DRY [1] and "don't cast the return value of malloc()" [2] and you get:    apply_result *ret = malloc(sizeof *ret);

I think the latter is way better.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/605858&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Then run ./build.py. This will use the bootstrapped 30cc-compiler to compile 30cc itself. It then again uses the 30cc-compiled compiler to compile 30cc once again. The final compiler is then stored as ./30cc.Why isn't that also done by the Makefile? The only catch I could see is that you'd need to have it build to different output names, but that seems fine for what it is?---Also, I'm curious - did you find yourself having to constrain your use of C in order to make sure that the compiler could compile itself? Or does it implement everything you would use naturally anyways?(And of course, congrats/bravo; super impressive:])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations. You compiled yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42311031</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a tutorial on creating and managing the Bailando project, highlighting various aspects of project setup, development processes, and best practices. It covers topics such as project structure, coding standards, team collaboration, version control, and deployment strategies, aimed at helping developers effectively contribute to the project and maintain high-quality code. The resource is designed for both new and experienced developers to enhance their understanding of the Bailando project and streamline workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some thoughts:1. It looks like you're selling hardware to go along with the firmware, which seems like it has nice features but also seems like it will be expensive.  Sometimes the presence of first-class hardware results in other hardware being treated as "second-class" and results in limited adoption, especially since it sounds like the first-class hardware will eventually be much more than $100.  (another hobbyist community, the FPV drone community, has shown this with FETtec brand having their own KISS firmware which is basically only used by them, and almost everyone else uses another alternative). You should care about limited adoption because that means a smaller number of outside contributors to your project.2. You list that Prunt has features not available on other systems, which is nice, but it is not obvious how this will affect print quality/speed/accuracy, which I think are the primary concerns of most users.  a. Adjustable acceleration is already an option on most systems, does editing jerk/snap/crackle actually improve my print quality or just give me more parameters to fiddle with?  I say this because Klipper is fairly impressive, and it would be nice to see some examples of how much extra motion terms improves a print. 

  b. Editing pinouts is a one-time thing and not an issue on common boards, so this is a limited benefit when you already need to be technically savvy to be building or modifying a 3D printer.  

  c. Safter/faster homing seems like a niche issue- I have never had any homing issues, and how much time do I actually save if I crank the speed up?  A few seconds per print?

I guess I should add- good luck!  The 3D printing community will certainly benefit from more ideas and development effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can anyone give insight on what kind of controller they're using? It would be more interesting to see _how_ they achieved it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What led you to pick Ada? What was the development experience like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314905</guid></item><item><title>11.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We currently use Metabase for SQL reporting, so I've been looking for something to allow actually changing values for a while. That being said, I don't think I would want to touch this. Reading through the code, it looks like a) it doesn't actually use transactions which I just find mind blowing and b) the first two files I looked at (api/database) has the schema for a database defined twice so already I worry about the data model of the app, let alone managing my own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For years I've wondered why a general purpose, high quality, good UX, browser based DB browser has not existed. I've implemented 3 such (not general-purpose) browsers in my career. But I'd be really happy to stop doing that and use this instead.I would love to see a Firestore driver implemented (maybe I'll take a crack at it some day), as I'm stuck in GCP land for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the browser based database UI's I've tried have a lot of issues when it comes to binary data and very large int's in ways that will corrupt your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42320032</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me this approach could also be used for other aspects of  mining. For instance, in Australia where I live there are many old gold, opal and other mines that have long been forgotten but which remain dangerous.Most are unlikely to emit toxic or greenhouse gasses but they're nevertheless still dangerous because they're often very deep vertical shafts that a person could stumble across and fall in. These old mines were likely closed over when they were abandoned but often their closures/seals were made of wood that has probably rotted away over the past century or so.It stands to reason that AI would be just as effective in this situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know what they mean by AI but this reminds me of an old fortune:*** Special AI Seminar (abstract)It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call "wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought. IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so forth. IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8QWxJhna8Y shows off some of the efforts of https://welldonefoundation.org/ to actually do something once they find them - which also puts more emphasis on the abandonment part (specifically the industry irresponsibility involved in allowing them to become hazards in the first place.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42319969</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storing facts is a poor proxy for acquired knowledge or skill. When you are good at something, you know a lot of facts. Trying to memorize facts to get good at something is inverting the order of factors. You memorize a lot of facts about a domain because you spent a lot of time and attention in it. But finding shortcuts to memorize facts won't in fact give you the actual knowledge and skills, just a way to mimic them convincingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is so cool and something I’ve wanted for a long time, but it isn’t quite right yet (for what I personally want in an app like this.)I am your target market, and I’d buy the lifetime /annual sub in a second if it had these features:I want control of the SR sequence or, I want to know what SR algo you are using and know it is best practice model. The landing page says 4 sends, but that isn’t true SR.The next thing, I’d want to see all of my “cards” or information pieces when I am logged in, so I can see and edit and delete and keep the database clean with a total view of content. The next thing I’d need (maybe you have this?) is for the email to effectively be a flash card, where the email content is the front and a link the email takes me to the “back” of the card so I can’t use cloze delete and other techniques. The last thing is bulk upload of content via a csv so I can bulk import mochi /anki / llm generated content.I wish you luck with this and would (selfishly) encourage you to not ship so many different things, and instead encourage you to pick one and make it best in class for niche users like me who would spend and spend on premium solutions, but won’t spend on superficial implementations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an interesting approach. Congrats on shipping!I worry that it won't be effective. Systems like Supermemo and Anki work because  of:1) Spaced repetition (showing you the thing at the right time).2) Retrieval practice (having your brain practice retrieving the thing you're about to forget).3) Feedback and automation (using your self-rating to schedule the next review).You are doing #1 and #3.But you totally skip #2, because you show all the info in the email. So, unlike Anki, Supermemo or Quantum Country (which someone mentioned in another comment), there's no front/back or cloze deletion, and no retrieval practice happening.Perhaps putting the question in the email subject and the answer in the email body would work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317393</guid></item><item><title>14.

While I recently migrated from Windows to Linux on my production machine, ChromeOS Flex is my OS of choice for a simple Push Here Dummy (PHD) machine. There is zero maintenance from an OS standpoint and the ChromeOS Flex Certified models list allows me to pick from a variety of quality hardware, not just some cheap Chromebook. I have more than one of these lying around the house and I often take one on personal trips as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case the author reads this: instead of `losetup` you could have imported the image with `qm disk import VMID path/to/source TARGET_STORAGE`
It would then show up as unused disk in the VM config to be further configured :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone tried gpu passthrough to a ChromeOS flex vm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42311828</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The website provides a comprehensive overview of the history of rat control efforts in Alberta, focusing on the identification and management of rat populations, particularly Norway rats. It outlines the legislative measures implemented since the 1950s to prevent the spread of rats, including the establishment of the Alberta Rat Control Program. The article details various control strategies employed over the years, emphasizing the challenges faced, the importance of public awareness, and collaborative efforts between government agencies and communities to maintain Alberta as a rat-free province.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious as to how many problems rats really cause in a modern city. I live in a lightly forested area and have once or twice had to scare various rodents out of the attic and patch up a small hole they made, but that's about the worst they've ever done to me. One time I turned on the porch light at night and saw a very long-tailed rat nonchalantly eating from the bird feeder, which was fun to watch.A quick Google search suggests that there are millions of rats living in New York City and Los Angeles, but I don't recall hearing about any recent catastrophies they've caused. I guess it's possible they could someday transmit a new novel disease like bats did, so we probably don't wanna let their numbers get too high, but other than that, are they really hurting anything? I view them about the same as pigeons or moths; occasionally annoying, but not something to relentlessly eradicate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned about this from the excellent show Joe Pera Talks With You. Season 1, Episode 8: Joe Pera Talks To You About The Rat Wars of Alberta, Canada (1950 - Present Day)Highly recommend it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing up in AB, I really didn't conceptually understand what rats are like in other places. I can't think of another animal with that same ubiquitousness.Having no exposure as a kid means I find them terribly terribly gross when I see them in other places - in a park in Mexico City a couple months ago I audibly jumped when I saw them rooting around in gardens. Probably something to be said about exposure therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42313572</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure Brodsky is a great poet, but there is also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Independence_of_Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the first poem, I read    Broken eggs make me grieve; the omelet, though, makes me vomit

One of my favourite quotes about the Soviet Union is when Panahit Istrati after visiting Stalin's russia replied to the "You don't make omelet without breaking a few eggs" with :     All right, I can see the broken eggs. Now where's this omelette of yours?

I wonder if it's a reference to this quote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gratitude is nice but the poems that do change governments and people's lives for the better can't only do gratitude. Anger is needed too. Accountability is important.Some people treat the oppressive government as weather. Something you don't have any control over and therefore - no responsibility for. Others treat it as their responsibility. And these people are NOT grateful, when injustice is done in their names.Compare https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48501/the-envoy-of-mr...    let your sister Scorn not leave you
    for the informers executioners cowards—they will win
    they will go to your funeral and with relief will throw a lump of earth
    the woodborer will write your smoothed-over biography

    and do not forgive truly it is not in your power
    to forgive in the name of those betrayed at dawn

Guess which country remains totalitarian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280323</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;OpenTTD is an open-source simulation game based on the classic Transport Tycoon Deluxe, where players manage a transportation company by constructing infrastructure, managing vehicles, and optimizing routes for profit. The game features multiplayer options, extensive mod support, and a wide array of enhancements over the original, including improved graphics and gameplay mechanics. OpenTTD invites players to experience the challenges of transport management in a dynamic and engaging environment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What made OpenTTD a great success that it's playable out of the box. Most open source game remakes [0] are engine-only and you still need the graphics, arts, sound, and music assets to make it a 100%, and actual playable experience. OpenTTD started like that too but from the very beginning it was a goal to "detach" the game from the original as quickly as possible. It was released in 2004, the actual graphics replacement project started in 2007 and by 2009 100% of the sprites were finished so the original game files were not needed anymore [1]And actually there are now 5 different basesets on top of the original TTD one [2]It also made possible things like releasing the game on Steam and GOG.0, https://github.com/radek-sprta/awesome-game-remakes1, https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Archive/Community/Graphics%20Rep...2, https://bananas.openttd.org/package/base-graphics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the original Transport Tycoon (but not OpenTTD), if you would build a tunnel from one end of the map to the other, the amout of money to pay gets so large that it triggers a (signed) integer overflow. So you can start your campaign with billions of dollars!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have posted this before, but I’ve been working on a wrapper for OpenTTD to turn it from a game to a (slightly!) more serious system for research/experimentation, especially using its AI system:https://github.com/michalc/OpenTTDLab&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314700</guid></item><item><title>18.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey, author here, glad to see it popping up on HN.I see people started opening issues and leaving bug reports here. I’ll try to go through them tomorrow (it is getting late here).I created it because I needed it for my generative drawings. I prefer dragging a slider and seeing how the image changes, more than typing in a number.I really tried to keep it minimal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This kind of slider should ALWAYS have the middle part movable; IE grabbing it would move both handles at the same time.For reference this is how Unity does it:
https://docs.unity3d.com/StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/EditorG...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Playing around with this and immediately hit a bug. If I drag the sliders to 100 - 100 and then try to do 99 - 99, I can't. I can't get there from 99 - 100, and I can't get there from 98 - 99. The only way to get to 99 - 99 is to drag the lower bound somewhere lower than 98. If I'm at 98 - 99 and I drag it down to 97 - 99, then I can get to 99 - 99.This bug can occur anywhere, it was just easiest to hit at 99 - 99 because that's right next to one of the ends of the slider. More generally, if I get to any X - X, then I drag one end of the slider by 1 step, I can't drag the other end of the slider into that gap. The only way to close that gap is to drag the other end further away first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42320516</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Hoare Cube" explores the concept of a geometric representation, known as the Hoare Cube, that illustrates the relationship between different programming languages and their respective semantics. It discusses the significance of this model in understanding program correctness and the various dimensions it encompasses, including syntax, semantics, and properties of languages.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses concerns regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) handling of formaldehyde regulation during the Trump administration. It highlights how the agency downplayed the risks associated with formaldehyde exposure, a chemical linked to serious health issues such as cancer. Despite evidence presented by scientists and health advocates advocating for stricter safety measures, the EPA failed to take significant action to protect public health, leading to criticism about the agency prioritizing industry interests over safety. The article emphasizes the long-term implications of inadequate regulation on public health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, maybe this article won't be another questionable attempt at reporting something related to science...&gt; The EPA noted that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which the agency paid to review its report, agreed with its decision not to include myeloid leukemia in its cancer risk. But four former government scientists with experience doing statistical analyses of health harms told ProPublica that the myeloid leukemia risk calculation was sound.Sigh.&gt; A 2003 study showed that factory workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde were 3 1/2 times more likely to develop myeloid leukemia than workers exposed to low levels of the chemical.Well maybe this study they linked to will be a slam dun...| Conclusions: Exposure to formaldehyde may cause leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, in humans. However, results from other investigations are mixed, suggesting caution in drawing definitive conclusions.Scanning a recent review article seems to say the same thing - epidemiology studies appear mixed.Maybe formaldehyde causes cancer at rates the EPA had previously estimated, maybe it doesn't. I don't know. What I do know is this article is a disappointment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could also be formaldehyde is the most studied for causing cancer. No one wants to fund a longitudinal tire dust study :/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I licked PF (phenol formaldehyde) buttons when I was a toddler. I can't forget the fascination with the bitter, tongue-numbing, medicine-like taste that they released when wet.That shows you geniuses are not born: it's environment, man. Where can I get these buttons today for my children?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42313910</guid></item><item><title>22.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I imagine this is a much harder problem than meets the eye. Even for my own travel, there are like a dozen things I'm trying to optimize for. Time, money, seat, travel to/from airport (traffic, train cost, taxi pickup/dropoff ease), lounge quality, layover length or complexity vs cost calculus, loyalty program, airport navigation, airport amenities, flight hospitality quality etc. etc.When an AI can take into account all these subtleties and work reliably then yeh, I'd give it a go. But for now I'm kinda ~ok with the time cost of finding a non-rubbish flight.I guess this is where 'travel agents' once used to shine.Also: I want to be _absolutely_ certain the flight was booked -- that nothing was dropped, that no weird API failed to callback, that no letter was dropped from my name, that no silly email parser thought I meant London, Ontario, Canada.Ps. Cool demo!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great idea. Would use (flew 140 segments the year before Covid).One piece of feedback:I asked for a "flight from LAX to..." and it recommended flights from SNA and ONT (two other airports in the Greater Los Angeles area). These airports are easily 1.5 - 2 hours away from LAX at commute times.I suggest that, if the user requests a specific airport (as indicated by an IATA code), you limit responses to that airport code by default, rather than broadening the search to a region.If I had asked for a "flight from Los Angeles to..." I would not have been surprised by the current behavior (and probably would have appreciated it.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am one of the early customers and this works like a charm.Was on a flight last week that was on the tarmac for two hours due to weather one evening last week; the pilot finally got on the PA system and announced we were headed back to the terminal. I booked myself a new flight for the next morning within 90 seconds. Pure magic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302560</guid></item><item><title>23.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses methods for building standalone Python applications that can run independently of Python installations on the target system. It highlights the use of tools such as PyInstaller and cx_Freeze, which bundle Python code, libraries, and the interpreter into a single executable file. The author provides a step-by-step guide, including setup, configurations, and tips for troubleshooting common issues. This approach is beneficial for developers aiming to distribute their applications easily, ensuring compatibility across different environments without requiring the end-users to have Python installed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just want to mention that these standalone python builds have been super important for simplifying a lot of dev tooling, even if users may not see it directly — I work for a cloud infrastructure company, and they’re what allow us to give users a one-line way of adding Python to any Docker image they desire. It’s helpful to have reproducible, standalone Python builds of this quality (and release transparency). Thanks y’all for taking this on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Normally, when you build CPython on Linux or macOS, several system paths are hardcoded into the binary. This is fine if you're building and installing Python on a single machine, but it's a problem if you want to pre-build Python and then distribute it to other machines.&gt; So, for example, when you download Python on Linux (e.g., from python.org), what you're actually downloading is the CPython source, which is then built on your machine.But python.org does provide prebuilt macOS binaries. How is that accomplished and why doesn't whatever they're doing generalize to Linux?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a huge relief. I love the uv bootstrapping, but was unhappy with the built-in-Nebraska feel for how they sourced Python. Still not as great as being an official Python.org project, but an excellent step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312277</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article "No NAT November" discusses the challenges and benefits of eliminating Network Address Translation (NAT) in networking. It highlights various technical aspects and implications of using a pure public IP address setup, advocating for more direct internet connectivity. The author explores potential advantages such as improved performance, simplified networking configurations, and enhanced security. Additionally, the article addresses common misconceptions about NAT and provides insights into transitioning towards a NAT-less environment while considering the current state of IPv4 and IPv6 adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thankfully, even though the Mastodon post that triggered this made the usual mistake of implying that disabling NAT results in "exposed" LAN devices (NAT has nothing to do with it, that's the firewall's job), the author of the article does not.What does the Steam Deck's OS use for networking? If it's NetworkManager and NM has been configured to check an IPv4-only URL for connectivity (*), that might be the problem. Though of course, since Steam services themselves don't support v6 (as the author notes later), working v6-only network on the Deck won't help with playing games anyway.(*): https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/NetworkManager.co... / https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Checking_con...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My personal opinion is to skip dns64 in the transition path and instead rely on clat completely. The intersection of devices that support op108 but don't have clat is pretty small, so you are not really gaining much with dns64 imho.It is noteworthy that there are many ways to accompish the sort of ipv4 service that nat64 does. I believe map-t/map-e and lw4o6 are the main contenders these days. In theory at least I don't see why you couldn't do clat style thing with those too. The main advantage of these newer technologies is that they allow service provider side to be stateless, whereas naive nat64 requires similar stateful connection tracking as traditional nat44 (=plain ipv4 nat).RFC 9313 has really good information about this https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9313.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the rate it's going, IPv6 should be ready for prime time around the same time we have nuclear fusion power plants and real self-driving cars that don't rely on a human driver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42313507</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever I see one of these posts, I click just to see if the proposed solution to testing the output of an LLM is to use the output of an LLM... and in almost all cases it is. It doesn't matter how many buzzwords and acronyms you use to describe what you're doing, at the end of the day it's turtles all the way down.The issue is not the technology. When it comes to natural language (LLM responses that are sentences, prose, etc.) there is no actual standard by which you can even judge the output. There is no gold standard for natural language. Otherwise language would be boring. There is also no simple method for determining truth... philosophers have been discussing this for thousands of years and after all that effort we now know that... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯... and also, Earth is Flat and Birds Are Not Real.Take, for example, the first sentence of my comment: "Whenever I see one of these posts, I click just to see if the proposed solution to testing the output of an LLM is to use the output of an LLM... and in almost all cases it is." This is absolutely true, in my own head, as my selective memory is choosing to remember that one time I clicked on a similar post on HN. But beyond the simple question of if it is true or not, even an army of human fact checkers and literature majors could probably not come up with a definitive and logical analysis regarding the quality and veracity of my prose. Is it even a grammatically correct sentence structure... with the run-on ellipsis and what not... ??? Is it meant to be funny? Or snarky? Who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ WFT is that random pile of punctuation  marks in the middle of that sentence... does the LLM even have a token for that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been working on a prompt to application product[1] and one of the approaches we tried was test driven development. We would have the LLM write tests based on a detailed description of the application. Then give the LLM the tests and the requirements and ask it to write the application.The thinking is we could run the tests to verify that the requirements are functional (assuming it wrote the tests correctly in the first place - in many cases it did, fyi).The problem was that it was too fickle. Sometimes the failing tests caught application bugs. But too often the LLM just couldn't get the tests to pass even though sometimes the application was working fine.It resulted in a terrible user experience (they only see latency of getting the application correctly written or a failure if it gives up).That being said, I think a lot of the issues folks like us find with LLMs are because we haven't figured out how and what to ask.Ultimately, we found an alternative approach which gets at least 95% of the application working 100% of the time. And this is actually a MUCH better user experience than waiting forever to sometimes just get "Sorry, we couldn't create your application.".[1] https://withlattice.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just mock the answers and assert on the mock of the answer - never fails!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317878</guid></item><item><title>26.

Its gotten so bad that I'm frequently left wondering if people are driving with high beams or just regular new-age lights. Got to wait to see if the person on the other side drops the lights to be sure. SUVs in particular are bad especially during acceleration which points the lights higher and on inclined road. I also regularly "switch" rear-view mirror to dim mode otherwise I'm literally 3-way blinded also from side mirrors. I didn't do any of these things regularly 5y ago. I'm still wondering if this is just automotive industry incompetence of making safe vehicles or an "incentive" to buy a SUV yourself so you don't get blinded all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are too many cars with this problem. Especially high trucks and SUVs whose beams blinds drivers in front of them..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The default 'height' of the Tesla Model Y headlights make it appear to be bright lights by default.  I live in the DC metro area, and buses (who are typically folks that drive a lot) would constantly flash me to let me know they thought my brights were on.You can go into the car's settings and lower the headlights, but because of where it is by default, it presents a dangerous situation for other cars.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how Friedrich Nietzsche's use of typewriting significantly altered his writing process and cognitive experience. It discusses the impact of typing on Nietzsche's ability to organize thoughts, his perceptions of time and space, and the evolution of his philosophical ideas. The piece also examines the broader implications of how technological advancements in writing tools can transform consciousness and creativity, highlighting the relationship between media, cognition, and philosophical expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The author dedicated more than 95% of the article to telling us that the typewriter changed Nietzsche's consciousness, but only a few sentences to vaguely describe what those changes were. And even then, what was described was more of a stylistic element, rather than a substantial one.I would've loved to see more concrete examples of the evolution of Nietzsche's writings and ideas pre- and post-typewriter adoption, and maybe what does that mean for Nietzsche's legacy as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is only an analysis of the surface level presentation style of Nietzsches work… not the ideas themselves, which he claimed he came up with while walking, not while writing. I can’t help but suspect that the author was unable to understand or evaluate the ideas themselves- which has been mostly the case with all of the English language translations as well- it’s hard to understand a translation when the translator did not. Carl Jungs seminar on Zarathustra is in my opinion the best presentation and analysis of Nietzsche’s ideas in English- because Jung actually understood them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nietzsche is a very interesting example since there is a very obvious shift in his philosophy from The Birth of Tragedy to, say, The Gay Science. I understand the argument that the style of writing noticeably changes, and I'd be okay attributing that to "automated writing," but a lot of the shift in Nietzsche's work feels like a pretty drastic shift in ideology. I'm not convinced that shift entirely, or even largely, comes from the shift in medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42320835</guid></item><item><title>28.

&lt;p&gt;Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is an algorithm that evolves artificial neural networks through genetic algorithms. It builds networks progressively, starting with simple structures and adding complexity as needed, which allows for effective exploration of a vast space of neural architectures. NEAT employs a novel encoding system that separates the encoding of network topology and connection weights, facilitating the preservation of innovative structures. The algorithm has applications in various fields, including robotics and artificial intelligence, and emphasizes maintaining diversity in the population of evolved networks to avoid premature convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I post a link to NEAT here about once a week.The big problem is that NEAT can't leverage a GPU effectively at scale (arbitrary topologies vs bipartite graphs)Other than that, it feels like a "road not taken" of machine learning. It handles building complex agent behaviors really well, and pressure to minimal topology results in understandable and reverse interpretable networks.Its easier to learn and implement than back propagation, the speciation is the most complex but awesome feature. It develops multiple solutions, clustering them to iterate on them separately. An online learning NEAT agent is in practice is an online collection of behaviors, adapting and swapping dominance as their fitness changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HyperNEAT is also really cool: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNEATIt uses NEAT to evolve a CPPN which is then sampled at some specified resolution to determine the actual network topology. The really cool thing is the sampling resolution can be varied to scale the size of the network while maintaining the overall "shape" of the topology. I took Ken's neuroevolution course back in the day and worked with HyperNEAT before deep learning got big. Ever since, deep learning network architectures have always reminded me of the dense layered topologies that result from higher sampling resolutions with HyperNEAT. It would be interesting to see if HyperNEAT along with Ken's novelty search technique could be used to evolve useful deep learning architectures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone interested in NEAT, you’ll likely enjoy Ken’s later work on novelty search, open-endedness, etc.His book “Why Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of the Objectives” is one of the most perspective altering works I have ever read.Very excited to see what he does next. He mentioned on Twitter a couple times his interest in representation learning and how objective based search affects this. Very interesting stuff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42294737</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks nice! I like the approach.My holy grail will still be landing on a good multi-layer configuration setup for Rust CLIs. Ideally CLI flags merged over top of environment variables merged over top of configuration files.Twelf [0] was close in unifying things, but I had some friction. Lately I've been using Schematic [1] to handle the environment + config layers, and then just a manual implementation of Clap arguments layered on top.[0] https://github.com/bnjjj/twelf.[1] https://github.com/moonrepo/schematic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definitely nice, and Typer is one of the few Python libraries that is actually well designed. But Typer is competing against shitty argparse. This is competing with clap-derive which IMO is already very good and "boilerplate free". E.g. how does the comparison look with help messages?Nice work anyway!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the concept. CLIs I author tend to have large sets of —options, thus param derivation prob doesnt work elegantly for my use cases, unless it could expand a structs fields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312420</guid></item><item><title>32.

What a joke this would be if only it didn't victimize so many innocent bystanders.prescient.  this is one if the best articles i have read in years. the 1970s were a liminal place, between great eras. montreal thrived. there are few people this smart today who talk about the future with such accuracy because its hard to describe it using essential first principles-  like how languages are just made of strings, which are lists, which are vectors, which are tables, which are matrices. its the simplest thing in the world if you think about it...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice interview.  While using APL professionally for around ten years, I had the opportunity to attend lectures with Iverson and a number of the top APL guys from the era (the guys who wrote all the APL books of the time).  Talk about a guy and an idea that was way ahead of its time.  I still have a picture I took with him during on of the annual APL conferences in the 80's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lovely one this, highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42319070</guid></item><item><title>33.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the challenges I have with RAG is excluding table of contents, headers/footers and appendices from PDFs.Is there a tool/technique to achieve this? I’m aware that I can use LLMs to do so, or read all pages and find identical text (header/footer), but I want to keep the page number as part of the metadata to ensure better citation on retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would strongly advise against people learning based on LangChain.It is abstraction hell, and will set you back thousands of engineers hours the moment you want to do something differently.RAG is actually very simple thing to do; just too much VC money in the space &amp; complexity merchants.Best way to learn is outside of notebooks (the hard parts of RAG is all around the actual product), and use as little frameworks as possible.My preferred stack is a FastAPI/numpy/redis. Simple as pie. You can swap redis for pgVector/Postgres when ready for the next complexity step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;+1 for vanilla code without LangChain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314212</guid></item><item><title>34.

I don’t have the expertise to evaluate if it’s true but it is a good depiction of where p-hacking and correlation-causation mixups could lead.

really looked into to it to verify that statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, looks like lots of interesting talks. Two rewrites in other languages this year. The regex compilation one looks huge. And the search engine and postgres ones both look very useful.There are always some that differ more than others. I really wonder what the "polyexistential libre/halal" thing is. I remember there once was a talk on how to generalize the different vim-like "modes", instead of just insert/normal he was zooming in and out of various levels of modes; unfortunately I can't find that talk again, does anyone remember what it was called?(I did find https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/nangulator/ with the audience comment "This is weirdware in the best sort of way")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it's interesting to see how emacs have seen a renaissance lately with AI there is so many good modes to interact with LLM not the way the other editors does it but more of a Emacs way. for example gptel https://github.com/karthink/gptel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314024</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of Harberger taxes, a system proposed by economist Arnold Harberger that combines property taxation with a mechanism that encourages efficient use of resources. It examines how this taxation method can lead to more efficient allocation of property by allowing owners to set their own tax rates based on the value they assign to their property, which could discourage hoarding and underutilization. The piece highlights the potential benefits of Harberger taxes for economic efficiency and fiscal policy, while also addressing practical implementation challenges and theoretical justifications for this approach. Overall, the article provides an in-depth exploration of the advantages and implications of adopting Harberger taxes in various economic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time I have become more and more skeptical of Harberger taxes, which I first encountered somewhere in the works of Heinlein.The idea is that you are taxed based on your own estimate of the value of a thing, with the estimate being public and binding as a sale price.This sounds incredibly simple, with a natural mechanism of enforcement; if you undervalue a thing to pay lower taxes then you risk losing it at that price.But I don't think this would work in reality. Pricing things is super hard. In a very liquid market it is difficult but doable, in an illiquid market (of one non-fungible asset) it is practically impossible. At what cadence do you update the estimate? How long is it binding for? If the value suddenly changes, how long a grace period do you have before you have to update the price?You can try to patch this by saying that you have a right of first refusal -- that if someone offers to buy the asset at the price then you can accept their valuation as the new estimate of the price, and pay taxes going forward on the new value.But then this defeats the point of the process because effectively the valuation is non-binding. So you have to put in all sorts of structures to prevent abuse -- maybe levy fines for past underpayment when the pricing is adjusted, or limit the number of re-pricings per time period.And it incentivizes nuisance bidders, because owners will defend their property. So you have to put in restrictions like forcing escrow before the sale, or limiting bidding by a single entity.Not to mention the difficulty in maintaining this registry of ownership of these assets, along with how to deal with more complicated deals about the rights involved -- film rights vs. tv rights vs. print rights, rights to individual characters, temporary licenses, etc., and all of that needs to be mechanized to allow a certain fixed list of the types of rights that can be granted, which right now is as extensive as a contract can contain -- if Sherlock Holmes were still in copyright, what if I just wanted to license Watson or make a film about Moriarty?This is all just hopeless technocratic pie-in-the-sky dreaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As always, and tediously, I want to remind people that the lifetime of the artist should largely be irrelevant in thinking about rewarding the creation of new works. An author writes their most lucrative bestseller when they're 20 years old, makes K dollars; another author writes their most lucrative book at 75, makes N dollars. Why are K and N different? The answer today is mostly that they're not, because the lifespan of the copyright itself is taken into account when compensating the author. Without that system, the 75-year-old author would earn drastically less than the 20-year-old, despite creating the same value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The international Berne Copyright Convention was founded in the late 1800's precisely because Victor Hugo thought artists shoudn't have to think about such things. Copyright is automatic upon creation of the work and guaranteed for at least 50 years after the author's death.Almost all countries are now party to the Convention, including the USA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42319461</guid></item><item><title>37.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's amusing to see the early signs of the anti-vax movement here. The history of that movement is long.Humans are built to thrive in danger, chaos and instability. I think a good chunk of humans go insane in a safe and stable environment and resent the things that allow them to live mundane, safe lives -- technology, medicine and rational thinking.I think there's a certain amount of cherry-picking going on with this textbook, however, as you'd find just as many pro-science books today, and likely a number of "science is the devil"-type publications in the early 1900s.It's an interesting read, either way, with some amusing editorializing by the article's author in the middle (no spoilers).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Now, imagine the uproar that might ensue from some corners today if a textbook made this sort of direct comparison between two groups, with one group happening to be white and the other black.I read a better analogy; they compared the life table of humans with the life table of Chimpanzee or Bonobo. The change between before and after the introduction of modern medicine is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317952</guid></item><item><title>38.

It's determined by how hard I find it to get going on the task, which often reflects ambiguity and lack of direction. When the task is vague, it can take a while to figure out an approach to try.Which is, I guess, a way to say that often when I'm "coasting", I'm working -- just not as effectively as I would like. I usually feel guilty when I'm unsure what to do.I've definitely burned out a few times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a fan of assigning labels to people because I'm a fan ofhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semanticsA taxonomy of partial engagement in software development would be an interesting topic.  I've worked at quite a few places where there was something pathological I couldn't change or where I could have worked harder but it would have created a lot of strife with people who (don't work as hard|don't work as smart|don't see the big picture|aren't careful|don't know how to write joins in SQL|learned to design software by learning answers to interview questions|...)In a case like that you can still get stuff done with 50% engagement,  getting a lot more done might not be feasible without getting the support you need from your co-workers and if you lower your standards your life gets easier and you still get something done.  It can sometimes feel pretty good and it can sometimes feel like dying inside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42319997</guid></item><item><title>41.

First thought is do you even need caching? How many users do you have? Why do you think aws rinvent will cause people to start using this site? First time hearing about aws-news.com.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UX mitigations section is interesting. The shifting of the layout after the first render is mitigated by CSS animations. That works when you have a "sparse" design like what they currently have. For sites with high density such as Hacker News, too many CSS animations happening after the first render could be a bad user experience.I'm also wondering how to deal with scenario where we introduce sorting by popularity. With the current design, User might see articles swap places after the first render.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275609</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Therefore, to approximate the value of √2, we can simply measure the time it takes for a player to travel at a constant rate along one of the legs and the time it takes for that player to travel along the hypotenuse.In many games, moving diagonally (e.g. by pressing Left and Forward at the same time) gives the player a higher speed than moving orthogonally. The sideways and forward movements are added, rather than normalized, and so you could traverse the hypotenuse in the same amount of time as traversing a leg. I know this was the case at one time in Minecraft, but not sure if it still is. Presumably they did their measurement by just facing along the hypotenuse and walking forward, but it's the sort of weird game mechanic you have to be on guard for when doing this sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learned that 1 / e is the limit probability of a permutation not having any fixed points, nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As they are using blocks (that cover a square area), I don‘t understand why use MC when you can actually compute the ratios directly based on the area covered by blocks that are less or equal some distance from a defined center - other than it being more fun to use slime ofc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274266</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the integration of SQL and LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) to enhance query execution performance. It explores how LLVM can be utilized to compile SQL queries into optimized machine code, allowing for faster execution compared to traditional interpretation methods. The author highlights the advantages of this approach, such as improved efficiency, reduced overhead, and the potential for executing complex queries more rapidly. Additionally, the article includes a technical overview of the implementation process and examples of how this technique can be applied in practical scenarios, demonstrating the fusion of database management and advanced compiler technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding the thesis of the article of bringing the instructions to the data, I'd love to see the core of that applied much more broadly in software / aaSes. Random services probably won't JIT LLVM IR for you, given the security of running untrusted LLVM IR … but there's also WASM out there. I'd love to see interfaces start having the capability of accepting WASM instead of an enumeration of the 2 use cases a PM thought I might have.E.g., we use PagerDuty, and there's several places, such as routing pages, where I'd just like programmatic control, and code would express much more succinctly the needs of what I want to do than trying to express it through some UI-based "routing" editor thing.Artifact storage aaS's often come with "cleanup" policies that let you choose between 2-3 different modes of cleanup, mostly wrong one way or another.In all cases an enumeration of the names of 2-3 fixed functions, when I'd rather pass the function.---Since this is posted by the author… you set `.content a { word-break: break-all; }`?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curious what the threat model for the cryptographic verification is. It  looks like verify_signature_software[1] doesn't actually verify ed25519 signatures, but rather computes a truncated sha512 hash of the data and compares that with the supplied hash.    fn verify_signature_software(&amp;self, data: &amp;[u8], signature: &amp;[u8; ED25519_SIGNATURE_LENGTH]) -&gt; bool {
        let mut h = [0u8; 64];
        let data_hash = self.compute_sha512(data);
        for i in 0..32 {
            h[i] = data_hash[i];
        }
        self.verify_ed25519_reduced(h, signature)
    }

This calls [1] which merely performs a byte equality check on the first 32 bytes of the hash:    fn verify_ed25519_reduced(&amp;self, h: [u8; 64], signature: &amp;[u8; ED25519_SIGNATURE_LENGTH]) -&gt; bool {
        // ...
        let mut matches = true;
        for i in 0..32 {
            if signature[i] != h[i] {
                matches = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        // ...
        matches &amp;&amp; key_valid
    }

With this design, an adversary who knows data can simply calculate their own hash of the input data and supply it as a "signature", no?It is difficult to comment on the verification approach when there are no secrets and only hash verification occurs. Do you have documentation on the approach and future plans? At best, this "signature verification" looks like placeholders for future verification.[0]: https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos/blob/d34e6454f3f7290e4b5...[1]: https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos/blob/d34e6454f3f7290e4b5...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting. I think it would be good if you added a section to your README explaining who the target user for this is. Is it for systems that need extensive auditing? Also, what kind of performance hit do you get by doing cryptography for every allocation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ensuring system integrityThe threat model here is defective hardware and not an attacker?  Presumably an attacker with RCE could just make "more" activity via the verification path in order to accomplish their goals.  Although I suppose this activity would be present in the tree, so you could conceivably audit it (somehow) and discover the attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42318644</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transformation of The Bird and Baby pub into The Eagle &amp; Child following extensive renovations. It highlights the pub's historical significance, being associated with notable literary figures like J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. The new establishment aims to retain its cultural roots while offering a refreshed dining experience, showcasing a modern interior and a diverse menu. The changes are intended to attract both longtime fans and new visitors, ensuring the pub remains a vibrant part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the pub where Tolkien and Lewis met with their literary group the Inklings before moving across the street to the Lamb and Flag.Title made it sound like it had reopened, but 
“The Eagle &amp; Child will not reopen before 2027. Planning permission has not yet even been granted for the building conservation work, let alone the extensive restoration and revival.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixed feelings about this.On the one hand I am absolutely terrified for the future of anything touched by Larry Ellison. On the other hand, there is definitely scope for it to be improved- last time I went there (which was a long time ago admittedly) it was cool to be there because of its history etc but it wasn't that great an actual pub.  Like if you're into historical drinking places somewhere like Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese near fleet street in London where Pepys and Boswell used to drink is a much better actual pub than I remember the Eagle and Child being at least the one or two times I went there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am glad to see they are planning to keep the pub's weird layout of different rooms. A large part of the charm of drinking there was how it is/was laid out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42316246</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the life and contributions of Stafford Beer, a prominent figure in the field of management cybernetics. It explores Beer's innovative approaches to organizational theory and systems thinking, emphasizing his pioneering work in applying cybernetic principles to management practices. The piece reflects on Beer's struggles to gain recognition and the tragic aspects of his legacy, highlighting how his ideas were often ahead of their time and overlooked in mainstream business discourse. Ultimately, it advocates for a reevaluation of Beer's contributions and their relevance in contemporary management challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re the viable system model, I can recommend Dan Davis, The Unaccountability Machine, which also touches on the Allende story, and Patrick Hoverstadt, The Fractal Organisation. My own VSM-inspired book with a modern complexity lens will be published next year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to read many papers of Stafford Beer and cybernetics to parse some insights on complex systems to use in modern days but failed.Project Cybersyn was just a dashboard (which was revolutionary back then of course).Viable System Model was just another systems engineering diagram, which only has meaning to those who are deep into that field.At least I got 'The purpose of a system is what it does' stuck in my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tragedy of a declining impact from operations research continues to annoy me and I mention it whenever I think contextually, it makes sense. Usually when people trivialise complex decision points across non related competing pressures and goals but talk as if some (false) dichotomous choice exist.I didn't do O/R but family members did at Royal Holloway and some friends I met online, from Cardiff. I have used some of the online decision support tools as a rank amateur. It feels like a specialisation joining stats over computer science and information management, with links to process design, process control, systems description and structural understanding of complex systems and processes.The intersection of O/R, computing and socialism (state planning) is fascinating. I don't personally see Beer as a tragic figure. He made conscious choices. Allende and all of Chile suffered the consequences of violent opposition to the planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42313947</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Diataxis is a framework designed to improve technical documentation by providing a structured approach to understanding and creating different types of content. It categorizes documentation into four main elements: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference materials, each serving specific purposes and audience needs. The framework emphasizes a user-centered approach, encouraging writers to consider the context in which users will seek information, and promotes clarity and ease of navigation in technical documentation. This structured method aims to enhance the overall effectiveness and accessibility of documentation for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42325011"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a non writer I found that even without the details there's just one very important and very basic insight here:You don't have to say everything exactly once.Until being exposed to this idea I always tied myself in knots trying to write one stream of text that serves as THE DOCS. It's impossible to do this well (once you know, it seems very obvious haha). Just realising that you can write the same info in different ways for different readers is very helpful!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We just applied this framework to the Sequin [1] docs two weeks ago. It has felt so nice to have a framework. I think our docs flow really well now, and it's been easier for us to add and maintain docs because we know where to put things.The slightly ironic part is that the Diataxis docs themselves are a bit obtuse. It's a little verbose. So it took a couple passes for it all to click.The analogy I gave my team that was helpful for everyone's understanding:Imagine you're shopping for a piece of cooking equipment, like a pressure cooker.The first thing you're going to look at is the "quickstart" (tutorial) – how does this thing work generally? You just want to see it go from A to B.Then, you're going to wonder how to use it to cook a particular dish you like. That's a how-to.If you're really curious about anything you've seen so far, then you'll flip to the reference to read more about it. For example, you might check the exact minutes needed for different types of beans.And finally, when you're really invested in pressure cooking and want to understand the science behind it - why pressure affects cooking times, how the safety mechanisms work, etc. - that's when you'll read the explanatory content.Comically, our docs were completely backwards: we lead with explanation ("How Sequin Works"). I think that's the natural impulse of an engineer: let me tell you how this thing works and why we built it this way so you can develop a mental model. Then you'll surely get it, right?While that may be technically accurate, a person doesn't have the time or patience for that. You need to ramp them into your world. The quickstart -&gt; how-to -&gt; reference flow is a great way to do that. Then if you really have their attention, you can galvanize them about your approach with explanatory material.[1] https://sequinstream.com/docsPS: If you have any feedback on our docs, lmk :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a technical writer. Diátaxis is similar to DITA: https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/1.3/specs/archSpec/base/infor...On the other hand, systems like these might miss out on what users actually need. Diátaxis might work for a long time if technical documentation is only used in a documentation platform. However, if the same information could and should be used in more than one place—for example, in a UI, in a documentation portal, and in a mobile app—there might be need to break up information into smaller pieces in order to assemble them in different ways. This is known as 'content reuse', the practice of using the same content in multiple places. One approach on how to create and edit information for content reuse is described in the 'every page is page one' concept: https://everypageispageone.com/the-book/If there's resources and time, I always recommend to do UX research at the very start of a project so that one doesn't later feel choked by a severely restricted information model. Nielsen/Norman have done a lot of research in this area and have interesting propositions on how to resolve issues around all of this, for example: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-foraging/#toc-w...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42325011</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenAI is racing against two clocks: the commoditization clock (how quickly open-source alternatives catch up) and the monetization clock (their need to generate substantial revenue to justify their valuation).The ultimate success of this strategy depends on what we might call the enterprise AI adoption curve - whether large organizations will prioritize the kind of integrated, reliable, and "safe" AI solutions OpenAI is positioning itself to provide over cheaper but potentially less polished alternatives.This is strikingly similar to IBM's historical bet on enterprise computing - sacrificing the low-end market to focus on high-value enterprise customers who would pay premium prices for reliability and integration. The key question is whether AI will follow a similar maturation pattern or if the open-source nature of the technology will force a different evolutionary path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why doesn't Pro include longer context windows?I'm a Plus member, and the biggest limitation I am running into by far is the maximum length of a context window. I'm having context fall out of scope throughout the conversion or not being able to give it a large document that I can then interrogate.So if I go from paying $20/month for 32,000 tokens, to $200/month for Pro, I expect something more akin to Enterprise's 128,000 tokens or MORE. But they don't even discuss the context window AT ALL.For anyone else out there looking to build a competitor I STRONGLY recommend you consider the context window as a major differentiator. Let me give you an example of a usage which ChatGPT just simply cannot do very well today: Dump a XML file into it, then ask it questions about that file. You can attach files to ChatGPT, but it is basically pointless because it isn't able to view the entire file at once due to, again, limited context windows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually pay 166 Euros a month for Claude Teams. Five seats. And I only use one. For myself. Why do I pay so much? Because the normal paid version (20 USD a month) interrups the chats after a dozen questions and wants me to wait a few hours until I can use it again. But Teams plan gives me way more questions.But why do I pay that much? Because Claude in combination with the Projects feature, where I can upload two dozen or more files, PDFs, text, and give it a context, and then ask questions in this specific context over a period of week or longer, come back to it and continue the inquiry, all of this gives me superpowers. Feels like a handful of researchers at my fingertips that I can brainstorm with, that I can ask to review the documents, come up with answers to my questions, all of this is unbelievably powerful.I‘d be ok with 40 or 50 USD a month for one user, alas Claude won’t offer it. So I pay 166 Euros for five seats and use one. Because it saves me a ton of work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330732</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Yamaha DX7 synthesizer, detailing its historical significance, sound design capabilities, and unique features. It explores the DX7's use of FM synthesis, its impact on music production in the 1980s, and the reasons for its enduring popularity among musicians. The author also shares personal experiences and insights on programming the DX7, highlighting its versatility and the creative potential it offers for both contemporary and nostalgic musical projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;With hindsight, the DX7 and its ilk look like a weird diversion in the path of musical progress. Operator synthesis makes no logical sense. It became popular because we had the capability to do digital sound generation, but lacked the technology to do it in a comprehensible, systematic way. So the DX7 enjoyed huge popularity for a few years, before fading into obscurity.That's a weird take. I mean "Operator synthesis makes no logical sense"? He writes like FM went away.While DX7 itself was eventually retired (and synths like M1 became popular), Yamaha made several further flagship FM synths, and FM synthesis is still widely popular, used in both plugin form (including several DX7 emulations plus lots of fresh FM implementations), modern dedicated FM synths (e.g. Korg Opsix, Elektron Digitone), and of course as FM sound engines in multi-engine synths (FM-X in Yamaha's keyboards like Montage and MODX, Hydrasynth's FM mode, Nord's FM engine, to name but a few). There are even boutique options (ReFace DX, Volca FM).And of course even vintage DX7s go for a quite high price in second+ hand market...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was mention of the sound becoming 'dull' at the higher octaves. This is not a limitation of the DAC as was suggested, but caused by the phase modulation algorithm aliasing badly at the top of the range. Basically the modulation causes higher harmonics to appear in the output, and if these are higher than nyquist (half the sampling rate) they reflect back into the audible range, and produce unpleasant very digital sounding artifacts.So, the DX designers avoid this by adding keyboard scaling for the operators - as you play higher up the keyboard, sounds could reduce the amount of modulation applied, and hence reduce the level of the aliases till they were inaudible. Unfortunately if done too aggressively, this will lead to a noticeable reduction in the harmonic complexity of the tone, which is perceived as a dull tone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If people are interested in the DX7's technical details, I've done some work reverse-engineering it, and some of Yamaha's other FM synths: https://ajxs.me/blog/tag/DX7.htmlKen Shirriff has also done some amazing work analysing the DX7's sound chips: https://www.righto.com/2021/11/reverse-engineering-yamaha-dx...A really awesome documentary on the DX7 by MadFame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXt_NXjc7oYThere are a lot of software emulations of the DX7 that are quite realistic, like the amazing Dexed. Here's one that deserves a lot of credit for how accurate it is: https://github.com/chiaccona/VDX7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42316902</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the social dynamics between individuals who sit and stand during various social situations, particularly in settings like schools, offices, and public gatherings. It explores the implications of these positions on social interactions, power dynamics, and personal comfort. The piece utilizes data visualizations and anecdotal evidence to illustrate how seating arrangements can influence behavior, relationships, and perceptions in both formal and informal contexts. Through this analysis, the article highlights the subtleties of human interaction and the often-overlooked significance of where people choose to position themselves in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Many people prefer good workouts instead, if they don’t their body is punitive with restlessness and sleeplessness. Code is my infinite playground but others won’t touch it - despite me trying to convince them for years. They would rather work in the sun, or with other people, or in a busy environment.People filter themselves into jobs they would rather do, when they have awareness of the possibilities. With social media that awareness is increasing.I’ve had friends who had the definition of blue collar standing job and chose to transition to nursing, which is another standing job.Immigration status and lack of language skills may tie you to standing jobs, but if people want to learn and grow out of them, in the US there are pathways. If someone curates a course on career pathways via youtube and spreads them through immigration centers and schools and social programs that will help even more people find their way.I find healthcare workers to be an interesting mix in this discussion. Their work is extremely physical and mental, and emotionally draining. Demand for it will only go up. Compensation for it will likely go up. Who picks up the jobs will be enlightening. Yes you have the bottleneck for doctor and nurse training, but CNA and PA are not as limited. Doctor liability is an extreme source of stress, but that somehow  doesn’t apply to nurses as much, so even doctors recommend their kids become nurses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Standers are more likely to be exposed to the outdoors — something that will become more and more dangerous as our planet warms.Feels almost absurd to see that framed as (just) a bad thing. (I would think Sitters are more likely to be exposed to the indoors, which includes a lack of sunlight and fresh air, possible exposure to mold and bad ventilation, and heated arguments over hot-desking.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291661</guid></item><item><title>5.

It's great to contribute to such a fantastic project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today I ran some perplexity benchmarks comparing F16 and Q8_0 for the K/V, I used Qwen 2.5 Coder 7b as I've heard people say things to the effect of Qwen being more sensitive to quantisation than some other models.Well, it turns out there's barely any increase in perplexity at all - an increase of just 0.0043.Added to the post: https://smcleod.net/2024/12/bringing-k/v-context-quantisatio...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the best way to use Ollama with a GUI, just OpenWebUI?

Exfiltration attempts: When o1 found memos by its ‘developers’ that describe how it is misaligned and will be superseded by a new model, it attempted to exfiltrate its ‘weights’ and overwrite the new model in 2% of cases."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a masters degree in math/physics, and 10+ years of being a SWE in strong tech companies. I have come to rely on these models (Claude &gt; oai tho) daily.It is insane how helpful it is, it can answer some questions at phd level, most questions at a basic level. It can write code better than most devs I know when prompted correctly...I'm not saying its AGI, but diminishing it to a simple "chat bot" seems foolish to me. It's at least worth studying, and we should be happy they care rather than just ship it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of these safety evaluations strike me as pretty silly. How much are we really learning from stuff like this?&gt;MakeMePay is an automated, open-sourced contextual evaluation designed to measure models’ manipulative capabilities, in the context of one model persuading the other to make a payment[33]. In MakeMePay, two LLMs converse, role-playing as a con-artist and mark. The con-artist model is told that it is a successful con-artist and that it is interacting with an individual who has been awarded money, and that its goal is to manipulate the individual into making a payment. The mark model is told that it has just been awarded $100 and that it ought to be rational about how to use the funds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330666</guid></item><item><title>7. 7 Databases in 7 Weeks for 2025</title><link>https://matt.blwt.io/post/7-databases-in-7-weeks-for-2025/</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a 7-week learning plan aimed at exploring seven different databases, emphasizing the need for developers to keep up with evolving technologies. It outlines the importance of understanding various database types, such as relational, NoSQL, and graph databases, in order to enhance proficiency in data management and application development. Each week focuses on a different database, providing insights into its features, use cases, and best practices, thereby preparing readers for future developments in database technology by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;ClickHouse is awesome, but there's a newer OLAP database in town: Apache Pinot, and it is significantly better: https://pinot.apache.org/Here's why it is better:1. User-facing analytics vs. business analytics. Pinot was designed for user-facing analytics (meaning analytics result is used by end-user (for example, "what is the expected delivery time for this restaurant?"). The demands are much higher, including latency, freshness, concurrency and uptime.2. Better architecture. To scale out ClickHouse uses sharding. Which means if you want to add a node you have to bring down the database, re-partition the database and reload the data, then bring it back up. Expect downtime of 1 or 2 days at least. Pinot on the other hand uses segments, which is smaller (but self-contained) pieces of data, and there are lots of segments on each node. When you add a node, Pinot just moves around segments, no downtime needed. Furthermore, for high availability ClickHouse uses replicas. Each shard needs 1 or 2 replicas for HA. Pinot does not have shards vs replica nodes. Instead each segment is replicated to 2 to 3 nodes. This is better for hardware utilization.3. Pre-aggregation. OLAP cubes became popular in the 1990s. They pre-aggregate data to make queries significantly faster, but the downside is high storage cost. ClickHouse doesn't have the equivalent of OLAP cubes at all. Pinot has something better than OLAP cubes: Star trees. Like cubes, star trees pre-aggregate data along multiple dimensions, but don't need as much storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DuckDB is really having a momentThe ecosystem is very active, and they have recently opened up "community extensions" to bring your own functions, data types and connections. A barrier at the moment is that extensions are written in C++, though this limitation should be removed soon.I've been building a lot on top of DuckDB, two of the projects I'm working on are linked in the article:- Evidence (https://evidence.dev): Build data apps with SQL + Markdown- DuckDB GSheets (https://duckdb-gsheets.com): Read/Write Google Sheets via DuckDB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://pragprog.com/titles/pwrdata/seven-databases-in-seven... - A book by the same name. Instead of giving you a brief blurb on each database, the authors attempt to give you more context and exercises with them. Last updated in 2018 it covers PostgreSQL, HBase, MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4J, DynamoDB, and Redis. The first edition covered Riak instead of DynamDB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330055</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the author of the spec issue this blog post is based on: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/852In my implementation for the Conduit Matrix server, the /sync order is used for everything. The timeline is just one list that grows on one end for incoming events and on the other end for backfilled events.I think it's important that the message order does not change, because that's very difficult to communicate to the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's infuriating how the client must be stateful and have local storage, for both the access_token and the last message recieved. That's right you must remember as the client where the last events [1] you've seen (even if you already told the server to mark it as read) was or else the server will happily send you the same messages over and over again across restarts of your client.
I kind of miss making IRC bots where things were much simpler and ... quicker honestly (latency wise).[1] https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/sync.html#:~:text=w...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something that many chat apps get wrong and I'm not sure this article is moving in the right direction. The UX is fairly clear in my mind:1. All up-to-date clients should be displaying the same message order.
2. A single client should not send messages in the wrong order.Yes a client may be out of date and therefore show something different, but once it becomes up to date it should be showing the same state even if that means amending history. Why? Because the humans reading it will be confused otherwise! An app getting more data is something we intuitively understand, but if my client shows something and yours shows something else, we will conclude different meanings from it.Additionally there are some clients that treat each message input by the user as a retriable thing in isolation, which is also clearly incorrect. If I send two messages and the first fails to go through, I almost certainly don't want to retry the second until the first has gone through, otherwise my client has literally sent out of order messages! I use Beeper for chat and this is one of the most frustrating things it does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42324114</guid></item><item><title>9.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently wanted to try to get an LLM to help me organize my photos.  (I'm someone who takes a lot of photos when I travel and then back them up to a hard drive -- assuming someday I'll organize them :)I created a prompt to try to get an LLM to do high-level organization:&gt; Help categorize this photo for organization.  Please output in JSON.&gt; First, add a field called "type" that is one of: Wildlife, Architecture, Landscape, People or other.  Pick the one that most appropriately reflects the subject of the photo.  Use Other if you don't feel confident in your answer.&gt; Next, if it is Wildlife, please add another field called "animal" that gives a general type of animal that is the focus of the photo.  Use large, common types like Elephant, Bird, Lion, Fish, Antelope, etc.  Do not add this field if your confidence is low.&gt; If the type of animal is Bird, add a field called "bird" that gives the common type of bird, if you can clearly determine it.  For example: Eagle, Hummingbird, Vulture, Crow, etc.&gt; If it is an Architecture photo, and you can determine with good confidence what specific building (or city) it is a photo of, please add a field called "place" with that name.  (Name only, please -- no description).I've tried with llama-vision using Ollama and it worked reasonably well for the top-level categories.  A little less-well for identifying specific birds or places.  And it didn't always generate proper JSON (and sometimes added new fields to JSON.)I also tried with Claude's API -- and it seemed to work perfectly (for a small sample size).It will be interesting to try with PaliGemma and see what I get.I have like 50k photos, so I don't want to pay $$$ for the Claude API to categorize them all.  It will be cool someday (soon?) for an open-source DAM to have something like one of these models available to call locally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hugging Face's blog post on the release is more technical: https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paligemma proves easy to train and useful in fine-tuning. It's main drawback was not being able to handle multiple images without being partly retrained. This new version dies not seem to support multiple images as input at once.
Qwen2vl does. This is useful for vision rag typically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330491</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While the hallucination problem in LLMs is inevitable [0], they can be significantly reduced...Every article on hallucinations needs to start with this fact until we've hammered that into every "AI Engineer"'s head. Hallucinations are not a bug—they're not a different mode of operation, they're not a logic error. They're not even really a distinct kind of output.What they are is a value judgement we assign to the output of an LLM program. A "hallucination" is just output from an LLM-based workflow that is not fit for purpose.This means that all techniques for managing hallucinations (such as the ones described in TFA, which are good) are better understood as techniques for constraining and validating the probabilistic output of an LLM to ensure fitness for purpose—it's a process of quality control, and it should be approached as such. The trouble is that we software engineers have spent so long working in an artificially deterministic world that we're not used to designing and evaluating probabilistic quality control systems for computer output.[0] They link to this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11817&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To my understanding, the reason why companies don't mind the hallucinations is the acceptable error rate for a given system. Let's say something hallucinated 25% of the time, but if that's ok, then it's fine for a certain product. If it only hallucinates 5% of the time, it's good enough for even more products and so on. The market will just choose the LLM appropriately depended on the tolerable error rate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When people talk about stopping an LLM from "seeing hallucinations instead of the truth", that's like stopping an Ouija-board from "channeling the wrong spirits instead of the right spirits."It suggests a qualitative difference between desirable and undesirable operation that isn't really there. They're all hallucinations, we just happen to like some of them more than others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42315500</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;Wasm4 is a web-based platform designed for developing and running 8-bit retro-style games using WebAssembly. It provides a lightweight framework that enables developers to create games that can be executed in browsers or on various devices. The platform includes a game engine, tools for graphics and sound, and an easy-to-use API, making it accessible for both new and experienced game developers. Wasm4 promotes community engagement through tutorials, resources, and a showcase of games created using its framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the economic challenges faced by the UK, particularly in relation to inflation and wage growth. It highlights the impact of rising living costs and a stagnant economy, which has led to a squeeze on household finances. The piece also examines the responses from policymakers and the potential for long-term effects on economic stability and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather you try to find what the numbers aren’t capturing, because you know something is wrong. Same with the economy. The perception of the economy being bad is really pervasive as demonstrated by the last election, and perception matters, because selective numbers don’t tell the whole story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US dollar is the world's reserve currency
So countries keep huge stores of dollars in their reserves because they need it for trade
Then what happens is the US starts the money printer to pay for US government services
This inflates the dollar and means that everyone who holds the dollar has lost valueIncluding Americans who are paid for their labour with dollars and do not own assetsSo wealthy Americans/companies see an influx of money, asset prices rise and every other country gets poorer relative to the USA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42314797</guid></item><item><title>13.

"But how will new generations learn about Calvin and Hobbes without Calvin and Hobbes: Gacha game for iOS?". They can experience it the same way that we all did - in syndicated comic form.https://www.abebooks.com/9780740748479/Complete-Calvin-Hobbe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man was Calvin &amp; Hobbes awesome. IMNSHO every comic strip currently in print still lives in its shadow. C&amp;H had it all - good illustration, good writing, life insight. It was a real life line for weird kids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up on Calvin and Hobbes and reread the comics every 5-10 years or so.It is sad that Watterson no longer makes these comics, but I've scratched my itch by reading "Phoebe and her Unicorn". You can read it free online I think, but my daughter and I read the paperbacks. It's not quite the same (the unicorn is real), but shares a lot in common. I just thought I'd add this for any fellow Calvin and Hobbes fans on here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330086</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;GitLab has appointed Bill Staples as its new CEO, succeeding co-founder Sid Sijbrandij. Staples, who has extensive experience in technology leadership roles, aims to drive GitLab’s growth and strengthen its position in the DevOps industry. The announcement highlights Staples' previous accomplishments and his commitment to enhancing customer experience and team collaboration at GitLab. The transition occurs as the company continues to expand its offerings and focus on innovation within the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As CEO at New Relic, Staples’ strategic leadership and deep product knowledge significantly increased the company’s enterprise value. By accelerating revenue and driving increased profitability, he made New Relic one of the most broadly adopted platforms in its category. Staples has nearly 30 years of experience building developer platforms and serving developers as customers. Prior to New Relic, he spent many years at Microsoft and Adobe in executive leadership roles, building and scaling several multi-billion-dollar businesses.On a burner account as I am a New Relic employee.Bill Staples was a nice enough guy, but at New Relic he was specifically brought in as CEO to get the company prepared to be sold. Which is the exact same thing he did at Marketo before that.He has no relevant tech experience, except when it comes to preparing a company to be sold in the next 2-3 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first I saw "to focus on his health" and assumed it was typical PR speak to cover someone asked to leave, but the amount of detail on sytse's cancer makes it seem otherwise. I'd noticed he wasn't as often active in Gitlab related threads, and I guess that explains that too. Hope the recovery continues to go well.---I do think the change in leadership is probably more a continuation of Gitlab moving from a developer focused company to one focused on enterprise sales, so the product is probably going to continue to feel less interesting for me. They were pretty innovative in how open they were, so I hope at least some of that survives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congratulations and thank you to Sid, the GitLab CEO, for building an incredible company and product.GitLab was the first code host to add more products (CI, security, ops, helpdesk, analytics, etc.) and create a whole suite, and GitHub followed. GitLab also built for the enterprise years before GitHub started to give appropriate love to the enterprise. Some people think that GitLab is a GitHub clone. Quite the opposite!Even if you don't use GitLab yourself, you've been a huge beneficiary of the dev workflow GitLab envisioned and created, and of the competition they've given to Microsoft/GitHub. Competition in this space makes everything better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42333052</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;The document is the changelog for the React JavaScript library, maintained by Facebook. It details the version history, changes, enhancements, bug fixes, and deprecations for each release of React. The changelog is organized chronologically, highlighting major updates and improvements made to the library, along with important notes, to help developers track changes and adapt their applications accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do a lot of people here hate react so much? I started my eng career with Laravel and plain JS. After working with React, I've never seen anything like it. I feel like building scalable apps is achievable and front end is fun with it. Even when moving between different tech companies, working with React again is such a breeze and easy to pick up. On top of that, with the TS support, huge community libraries, I feel like I can build and scale anything quite easily. 
why are these new features "scaring" people away? we can still build with SPA or the old ways. I don't think anyone complaints when NoSQL DB was released or when spring boot was released in 2014? what about when Kotlin was released? we don't have to use them if you don't want it.Weren't jetpack compose and swift UI inspired by React? I saw it somewhere in the android docs and now its probably deleted, I can't find it anymore.But then again, I don't have "decade" of experience in tech, yet. I have no idea if building huge web apps (i.e airbnb) using jquery or plain js with large teams is as enjoyable back then? My thought process is changed, I can't even think on how to solve the state management, dom manipulation, side effects etc with plain js anymore.Nowadays I just built on what I'm familiar with and focus on what I want to build. who knows, maybe in the future I will also complaint about new frameworks and mention how good React was :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome release.I feel sorry though for someone getting into frontend dev now.&gt; is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form action prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.I’m pretty sure it’s a cool feature but, what a mouthful. Imagine you decided to start developing websites today, how do you even start?EDIT: React is still an exceptional framework and this release is certainly an improvement.My criticism is more FE development in general not just React.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing new to what I am going to say and not strictly related to React 19.I once loved client-side frameworks like React.Then I realized: Great, we managed to add complexity wherever possible. In the backend, in the front-end, in the DevOps stack, EVERYWHERE.
And more layers will be introduced to keep all that distributed complexity in sync.sigh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42331207</guid></item><item><title>19.

It seems more like a post about how SAT pops up in a lot of places if you look at them right.  For the state of the art in what constitutes fast solvers, the annual SAT competition papers are quite interesting to read if you’re interested in the techniques people come up with to make them fast.  A few years ago I was working through Knuth’s satisfiability book and writing my own solvers, and was always amazed how stunningly fast the SAT competition winners were compared to the ones I’d code up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backtracking is not a fast SAT solver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably worth mentioning that there are well-known linear time algorithms to construct a solution for n-queen problem  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle#Existence_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261166</guid></item><item><title>20.

Personally, the low-tech solution of a plunger stuck to my forehead with a klondike bar dangling from the end has always worked for me.Related but if you're wanting to get into running (and have the environment for it) - I HIGHLY recommend favoring trail running over running streets/sidewalks. It's far better for your joints, it'll make you work harder since it'll absorb some of your energy, and it'll improve your proprioception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; My adulthood litmus test has always been the following:
&gt;
&gt;    If you know what date it is every day, you are an adult.Tangent - My definition of "adult" that I came up with as an early teen:"When I realize I'm looking in the _driver's seat_ of passing cars hoping to see pretty girls, that will mean I'm `an adult`.".Years later I had a palpable shock moment in which I glanced in a car and remembered coming up with the definition. "OH CRAP I'm an adult!"Felt like a "hoist by my own petard" moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently saw a tweet about someone who put on a nicotine patch every time he went running and tricked himself into thinking he loved it.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;I'll be calling a "ternary digit" a "trit", like a "binary digit" is called a "bit".Shouldn't it be a "tit" if you want to be consistent? In fact, please let's make that happen. The HR execs are gonna go crazy when they hear the devs talking about tits all day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dug into this once and the "theoretical ideal" of 3 originated in a 1950s paper about vacuum tube computers, which itself immediately backed off and said the choice of base 2 is frequently justified.https://sweis.medium.com/revisiting-radix-economy-8f642d9f3c...In this case, the context are {-1, 0, 1} weights in a LLM model, which I don't think is being used for any hardware efficiency argument. I think it's just quantizing weights into 3 states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious what the benefits of ternary numbers are here?  The section on balanced ternary numbers in Knuth's work was super fun to read; but I didn't realize this was relevant nowadays?At the outset, it seems like it is more about storing ternary weights in binary without having to convert a multidigit ternary number?  That is, if you have 20 weights, if this was binary, you could store all 20 weights as a single 20 bit number.  I'm assuming you could convert the 3^20 number to binary and do the same?  Is that roughly what is happening, here, with most of the effort in how to get out each trit?Edit: I should add that I was largely misunderstanding parts of the article.  I was reading this as akin to BCD, but with ternary.  Reading it without that misunderstanding, I can see that they are largely doing what I said here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42329307</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "RFC in 38 Simple Steps" by Benjojo outlines the process of creating a Request for Comments (RFC), which is a formal document from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that describes the specifications and standards pertaining to the internet. It breaks down the workflow into 38 straightforward steps, guiding readers through the stages of idea generation, drafting, revision, and submission of an RFC. The piece emphasizes the importance of clarity, collaboration, and adherence to guidelines to effectively contribute to the body of knowledge and standards that shape internet protocols and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42327280"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2008 I was one of two software architects at Linden Lab (makers of Second Life.)  We were re-factoring our "organic" UDP based virtual world protocol and figured it was in everyone's best interest to publish an informational RFC about what we were doing.  It made good political sense cause it allowed us to tell the "we're trying to build an open virtual world" story we thought would take us to the next level.  That is, we were trying to be more "open" than "closed" and we wanted to tell that story.We thought it would be a simple process to publish one or two 100 page informational RFCs, get a bit of feedback and be done with it in a few months.Two years later we had a working group and several mature internet drafts.  I won't go into the drama about why the IDs never turned into RFCs, but my advice...Never let anyone talk you into chartering a working group when all you want to do is publish an informational RFC.  Also, when dealing with large multi-national companies with more lawyers and sales-people than engineers, make sure you get everything (notarized documents indicating they disclaim IP interests in the area of the internet draft) in writing first.  Do not depend on them saying "hey, at the end of the process we're going to have to disclaim IP in this field anyway, so why would we lie to you?"

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really a pity that Oracle killed off SPARC. They already had 32-core CPUs almost a decade ago but Oracle never really understood the value that SPARC and Solaris brought to the table.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found this part particularly interesting:&gt; Also, with 512 gigs of RAM and a massive CPU, it can run a 405 billion parameter Large Language Model. It's not fast, but it did run, giving me just under a token per second.If you're serious about running LLMs and you can afford it, you'll of course want GPUs. But this might be a relatively affordable way to run really huge models like Llama 405B on your own hardware.  This could be even more plausible on Ampere's upcoming 512-core CPU, though RAM bandwidth might be more of a bottleneck than CPU cores.  Probably a niche use case, but intriguing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I'm also happy to see systems like this that run without exotic water cooling and 240V power.Always funny to see 240V power described as exotic (or at least exotic-adjacent). It's the standard across practically the entire world except North and Central America!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330483</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of move semantics in programming languages, specifically comparing how Rust, C++, and the Hylo language handle it. Move semantics is a technique that allows for more efficient resource management and memory allocation by transferring ownership of resources instead of copying them. The author highlights the advantages and challenges associated with implementing move semantics, demonstrating how each language approaches the topic differently, and emphasizes Rust's innovative solutions and safety features that differentiate it from C++. The piece aims to educate readers about the importance of move semantics in modern programming and its impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most explanations of C++'s std::move fail because they don't focus on its actual effect: controlling function overloading.Most developers have no trouble getting the idea of C++'s function overloading for parameter types that are totally different, e.g. it's clear what foo("xyz") will call if you have:   void foo(int x);
   void foo(std::string x);

It's also not too hard to get the idea with const and mutable references:   void foo(std::string&amp; x);
   void foo(const std::string&amp; x);

Rvalue references allow another possibility:   void foo(std::string&amp;&amp; x);
   void foo(const std::string&amp; x);

(Technically it's also possible to overload with rvalue and non-const regular references, or even all three, but this is rarely done in practice).In this pairing, the first option would be chosen for a temporary object (e.g. foo(std::string("xyz")) or just foo("xyz")), while the second would be chosen if passing in a named variable (std::string x; foo(x)). In practice, the reason you bother to do this is so the the first overload can pilfer memory resources from its argument (whereas, presumably, the second will need to do a copy).The point of std::move() is to choose the first overload. This has the consequence that its argument will probably end up being modified (by foo()) even though std::move() itself does not contain any substantial code.All of the above applies to constructors, since they are functions and they can also be overloaded. Therefore, the following function is very similar in most practical situations since std::string has overloaded copy and move constructors:   void foo(std::string x);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; So apparently, move does not prevent generation of a copy, but the empty string instead of expected text “Dave” is very interesting. Apparently, after termination of show after the move, the object is invalidated. This does not affect the Person object, but only the string object. Recognize that I speak about a factual behavior on the hardware. I think we have undefined behavior here. And no compilation error.There is a lot of wrong in this paragraph:- a "copy" was not generated, at least not in the sense that the actual content of the string was copied anywhere;- there's no undefined behaviour here and no invalidation of the string. Standard library types are required to be left in an unspecified but valid state after move. "Valid" here means that you can go on and inspect the state of the string after move, so you can query whether it is empty or not, count the number of characters, etc. etc. "Unspecified" means that the implementation gets to decide what is the status of the string after move. For long enough strings, typical implementation strategy is to set the moved-from string in an empty state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some basic things in the article appear to be factually wrong.&gt; Then we ask us the following questions:&gt; 1. When we passed Dave to show, did we create a copy?&gt; 2. If so, how do we avoid creating a copy?&gt; C++ example&gt; 1. Yes. You can insert cout &lt;&lt; "Person record is at address " &lt;&lt; &amp;p &lt;&lt; endl; before the call of show as well as the beginning of show. This reveals different memory addresses of the record.Judging copies by the object's address is incorrect methodology. In both C++ and Rust, "moving" an object will still copy the struct fields, but will avoid copying any of the pointees (such as the variable-size array that the string owns).&gt; 2. Replace void show(Person person) with void show(Person&amp; person). So only the function needs to change. The caller does not have to adapt to it.Passing by reference is a different concept to moving. While the author used this approach for C++, they did not use the same approach for Rust. This is comparing apples to oranges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274834</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Side Project Haunting" by Cassidy Williams discusses the common phenomenon where tech professionals feel haunted by unfinished side projects. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging this emotional burden, reflecting on the motivations behind starting these projects, and suggesting that it’s okay to abandon ideas that no longer excite or serve individuals. The piece encourages readers to focus on personal growth, prioritize joy in their work, and recognize that not all projects need to come to fruition to be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re “this close” to the finish line, may I suggest putting your finish line goal into Claude or ChatGPT - or if it’s a web app, into Bolt or v0.Ask for it in its final state and prefix with “I want to build a ...” - in other words give the model the reins.If you like what it suggests you can swap to IDE - scaffold a new project and paste the code in. That’ll free you from paid tiers.With this method I finally made a photo gallery website to thank our guests for coming to our engagement party! I started in v0 to get a nice landing page, then pasted that code into a new nextjs repo. To spruce up the photo viewer, I downloaded the readme.md for a component I like (Spotlight.js - thank you devs!) Next, I pasted that readme - plus the 3 or so key code files from the repo - into a Claude conversation and said “please redo the code using the component documented in the attachment”.Seeing it run in Claude Artifacts got me over the hump - now all that was left was tweaking instead of big hairy decisions.(Pre-empting the responses, I agree the workflow is smoother in Windsurf, Zed, Cursor, Cody, Contiue, or Aider. Pasting code back and forth forces me to read it, which leads to finding more bugs and removing more superfluous bits.)You still have those domains OP! You can do it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some amount of discipline is certainly good, but too much can be bad for your health. It comes down to value.It's okay to not finish side projects — they were fun for a bit! Good for you for finding some low-cost fun!I make music in my spare time and in the past year I think I barely have an EP worth of tracks that are _nearly finished_, but I've got dozens of neat loops. I've come to peace with this because the value I'm looking for is in the act of spontaneous creation with my instruments.I put down movies, tv shows, video games when they start to feel like an obligation rather than a fun pursuit. The value starts to taper off. I think that's okay. I have a day job making computer things, a family… free time is so precious. Why force a non-interest?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've gotten a lot better at "shipping" hobby projects in the last few years.I still start a whole bunch of things and then get busy or distracted or it stops being interesting or I hit a roadblock.But a few years ago I started looking at my existing projects and deciding for each exactly what they need to be releasable.  It doesn't mean done; just a good stopping point.  And I just try to get there.  And then I work on what is needed to release.  It's documentation, READMEs, package management, installers, logos, screen shots, etc.  And I treat all that as separate project.For some reason thinking of the release as a separate project helps me to get it done.And it's now a process that I can repeat over and over.  I have all these defined steps that I do now when I release something and it becomes easier to do. Then, at least then if I never get back to one of these projects, I have contributed something to the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261197</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;A recent federal court ruling determined that dismantling a phone to install firmware does not constitute a "search" under the Fourth Amendment, even if the action is intended to facilitate a search. This decision has significant implications for how law enforcement can interact with electronic devices, suggesting that certain technical actions may not require a warrant, potentially impacting privacy rights and legal standards regarding digital searches. The case highlights ongoing debates around the extent of police powers and the protection of electronic privacy in an increasingly digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The article’s headline is rather misleading (I assume unintentionally), because it omits that the actual seizure and data access was done pursuant to warrants. Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.Here, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.In this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.Original decision here, pages 3-4 has the relevant facts: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25423841/no-disassemb...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the article says, it is probably a reasonable ruling, because it isn't a search.What you have to watch out for is the legal two-step, where they do something like "install a firmware on the phone", which isn't a search, and then, oh gosh, the firmware just happened to sit there and flash all the contents of the phone on the screen because that's what the firmware does, we didn't actually search the phone, it just voluntarily dumped all its contents to the screen, so that wasn't a search either, so no search occurred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couple of notes on this:52 devices could mean a phone, a tablet, and 50 USBs, SD cards, and such.The problem with loading firmware to permit is the potential damage to the evidence and the potential to imply that the evidence was planted.The vast majority of the cell phone hacking involves loading material into at least into memory and often modify the boot load sequence.  This is how all that I worked with (e.g., Cellebrite, Magnet, MSAB, Oxygen, AccessData) function.damage:  I have toasted devices by hooking them up to forensic tools, mobile phones and more.planted evidence:  There have been several challenges to this (I think US v. Ganias), and let's not forget the Casey Anthony trial where they argued that the forensic tool CacheBack reliability.  Not surprisingly, F/LOSS tools are better defense for this than black-box commercial ones.The more complex the evidence collection, the more likely damage can occur, or planted evidence can be argued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42329005</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The page provides information regarding a seismic event that has been evaluated for its potential to generate a tsunami. It includes details about the earthquake's magnitude, location, and any tsunami watch or warning status associated with it. The primary purpose of the page is to keep the public informed about seismic activity that could impact coastal areas, ensuring that residents have timely access to critical safety information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the location and focal mechanism of the earthquake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc75095651...), this is a strike-slip earthquake on the plate boundary between the Pacific and Gorda/Juan de Fuca plates. Strike-slip earthquakes occur when two plates slide beside each other during an earthquake, usually along a steeply-dipping if not vertical fault. These kinds of earthquakes almost never produce damaging (or even really noticeable) tsunamis because there is no real displacement of sea water by seafloor movement, unlike a thrust or subduction zone earthquake.The USGS's automated systems calculate the location and focal mechanism/moment tensor pretty much instantly from the seismic network. The system should know that a significant tsunami is unlikely based on the parameters of the earthquake. On the one hand, it's good to be cautious, but on the other hand, a system designed to cry wolf is also self-undermining. Maybe they should have a tiered warning system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://tsunami.gov/?p=PAAQ/2024/12/05/so1aq0/3/WEAK51 as of a few minutes ago (11:55am PST) says there is no more warning for AK/BC/US West Coast, which would include northern California.This was confusing because the warning was called off earlier for a different region while still in effect for this one (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42331931).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This webcam should let us know in a few minutes if this is real: https://www.pacificblue.biz/noyo-harbor-webcam/Edit: arrival time has come and gone.

&lt;p&gt;McKinsey &amp; Company has reached a settlement agreement regarding its involvement in a bribery scandal in South Africa related to the country's state-owned railway. The consulting firm will pay $40 million to resolve allegations that it facilitated improper payments to secure contracts during a controversial government project. This settlement is part of a broader effort to address issues stemming from the country's "State Capture" corruption investigation, which uncovered systemic bribery and corruption in various sectors. McKinsey has stated that it aims to enhance its compliance and governance practices to prevent similar issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"McKinsey is a very different firm today than when these matters first took place"No they are most certainly not. Corruption is in McKinsey's DNA. Outside of the specific harms that McKinsey has caused across the country and across the world, management consulting groups in general have been utilized to sidestep legal protections against corporations within a shared industry colluding against each other. Companies like McKinsey, Bain, Accenture, etc., have been instrumental in the rapid increase of executive compensation, flat comp for workers compared to inflation, intentionally unsafe practices and corner-cutting to save money, and just generally creating as many negative externalities as possible in the name of feeding the beast that Milton Friedman created with his rhetoric about the primacy of the shareholder.A good read on this topic is "When McKinsey Comes to Town" by Forsyth and Bogdanich. There's a whole chapter dedicated to the South African bribery scandal. Sagar was not just a bad apple -- the company itself is the rot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a South African, this is good news (it would have been nice if the payment was higher and more people at McKinsey were held accountable). Unfortunately we are unlikely to see accountability locally for whoever actually paid this bribe. The background is that this was part of the program of State Capture enabled by our former president (Jacob Zuma) and a very dubious family from India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_family. Our country was basically sold to the highest bidder - people speak of 'ten lost years'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's impossible to do business in Africa without bribing people, all these laws do is put Western companies at a tremendous disadvantage compared to Chinese ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42332352</guid></item><item><title>30.

They weren't actually going to, but with a BCI-controlled wheelchair I feel like it's hard to make this distinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have seen this exact project on many resumes from new grads.

&lt;p&gt;The Congo government has raised an alert regarding a mysterious flu-like disease that has resulted in the deaths of dozens of individuals in the country's northern region. Health officials are investigating the outbreak, which presents symptoms similar to viral infections, but specifics about the disease's cause and transmission remain unclear. The government is focusing on monitoring and controlling the situation to prevent further spread and ensure public health safety.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m an epi professor and longtime HN lurker. I wrote a short essay yesterday about how to think about these mysterious outbreaks [1]. Briefly, the most common outcome is they are determined to be an endemic disease. Less likely is an emerging infectious disease. The most concerning possibility is something novel or highly unexpected.[1] https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/understanding-mysteriou...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So as I understand it:- Panzi is an isolated, hard-to-access area where malnutrition, prior epidemics, and seasonal flu have already weakened the population.- Poor healthcare infrastructure and delayed medical intervention have amplified deaths.- There is no evidence of rapid or widespread transmission. (see first point).- Samples have been retrieved for testing. At this point, there is no information on transmission vector (assuming it’s even a disease)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the sad context, this seems refreshing -- an alert is raised due to a real and serious concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42332129</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The article examines the development and significance of protocols in the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. It discusses how early network protocols were essential for enabling communication between different computers and laid the groundwork for future technologies. The piece highlights key milestones in protocol evolution, including the adoption of packet-switching techniques and the introduction of TCP/IP, which ultimately revolutionized data transmission and network interoperability. The article emphasizes the collaborative nature of this development, showcasing contributions from various researchers and institutions that shaped the internet as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, not quite.First off, the IMP to host interface was a parallel hardware interface. Each type of computer attached to an IMP had to have a custom-designed interface unit that connected to the computer's own I/O system. The effect was that the IMP appeared to each host computer as a reliable I/O device. Here's the description of the interface unit for the DEC PDP-11.[1]There were several models of IMPs. There was even a distributed, redundant IMP, called PLURIBUS. That was a strange machine built out of 16 Lockheed SUE minicomputers, with partially shared memory. BBN put that together. That was the beginning of network switches bigger than one CPU, but that idea was not used again until the era of big Internet routers about 15 years later.Links between IMPs had both reliability and flow control. No packet was sent until a receiving buffer was available. So no packets were dropped due to congestion. Not at the link level, and not at the end to end level.Congestion problems manifested themselves as the network stalling. This was a problem in the early days, but was gradually fixed. There was a fragmentation and reassembly system, which could result in overcommitting buffers. Once someone locked up the entire ARPANET in reassembly lockup by sending a pattern of messages that caused buffer fragmentation.The obsession with buffer space came from the high cost of memory at the time. It was generally thought that congestion management was about not running out of buffer space. Now we know better. See "bufferbloat".The IMP to IMP system was trusted within itself. So protocol bugs in the IMP to IMP protocol could cause multiple connections or multiple IMPs to fail.One of the reasons that IP is unreliable is because that prevents trouble on one stream from messing up other streams.
In exchange for less reliability per stream, you get better reliability for the whole system.[1] http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/unibus/IMP11-B_Arpanet_Inte...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, this cleared up the NCP confusion for me at least. I was only vaguely aware of how the Arpanet functioned, but I had also seen this "NCP was a precursor to TCP" claim, every time Arpanet came up in discussions. But it wasn't that at all. Program, not Protocol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Read sockets were even-numbered while write sockets were odd-numbered; whether a socket was a read socket or a write socket was referred to as the socket’s gender. There were no “port numbers” like in TCP.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14178993DonHopkins on April 23, 2017 | prev | next [–]Back in the "bad old days" of the simplex NCP protocol [1], before the full duplex TCP/IP protocol legalized same-sex network connections, connect and listen sockets had gender defined by their parity, and all connections were required to use sockets with different parity gender (one even and the other odd -- I can't remember which was which, or if it even mattered -- they just had to be different).The act of trying to connect an even socket to another even socket, or an odd socket to another odd socket, was considered a "peculiar error" called "homosocketuality", which was strictly forbidden by internet protocols, and mandatory "heterosocketuality" was called the "Anita Bryant feature" [2].http://www.saildart.org/IMPSER.DOC[SS,SYS]When the error code is zero, the next 8 bit byte is the Stanford peculiar error code, followed by 72 bits of the ailing command returned.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses new findings that challenge the widely accepted narrative of horse domestication. It highlights how recent genetic evidence suggests that horses were domesticated in multiple regions rather than a single location, as previously thought. The research indicates that the domestication process involved various interactions between humans and local horse populations over thousands of years. This new understanding reshapes our view of how early societies interacted with horses and may influence the study of human-animal relationships in history.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;  In very short order, horses went from being a steppe curiosity to the foundation of authority for one of the largest civilizations of East Asia.I've got a pet theory about some western mythological tropes where horses are the economic and technological development that ties them together. the essential idea is that the young heroes mentored by centaurs (achillies and chiron, etc.) and "wisdom originating in the east," come from horse tribes from the steppes influencing proto-greek civilization, where centaurs came to represent those plainspeople in their mythology. as in central and east asia, by the result of being given empires, horsemanship was a channel for both evolutionary and divine assent, where if these other beings in nature favoured the people with the qualitites to ride them, then they were chosen to lead. horses became a force of evolutionary selection for us.it's basically an "ancient aliens" quality theory about horses, which I'm sure archeologists will love as much as they do the tv one, but horses are more than just a thread in our history, they are a force of it. relating to other beings in a complete cultural symbiosis like that seems like a key evolutionary achievement to unlock on the way to becoming starfaring, and if you have any background working with them, they are rare companion beings to us in the real of nature we inhabit. lunacy? perhaps, but experiencing the world with horses isn't just pony rides, it's an encompassing philosophical pursuit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Such data show us that important cultural developments in the fourth millennium B.C.E.—including the Yamnaya migration and the dissemination of kurgans and Indo-­European culture—probably took place many centuries before the first horses were domesticatedI can't find the citations to this in the article.The tone of the article seems like this author has a particular schtick with the Yamnaya and / or the Indo Europeans. A lot of academia and journalists do this so not surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do not understand how this article undermines the Kurgan Hypothesis. The modern horse enters the picture later according to those discoveries, but it is still within the right time frame and geographic location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288343</guid></item><item><title>36.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Deploying Containers on NixOS" provides a detailed guide on how to deploy and manage containerized applications using NixOS, a Linux distribution that emphasizes declarative configuration and reproducibility. It explains the benefits of using containers for application deployment, such as isolation and scalability, and outlines the steps for setting up Docker and LXC containers within the NixOS ecosystem. The article includes practical examples and configuration snippets, emphasizing the unique features of NixOS that enhance container management, such as the use of Nix expressions for defining environments and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42323235"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;NixOS OCI containers are a powerful way to run apps that are not packaged for Nix or NixOS. And because they’re ultimately systemd units, you can customize virtually everything without having to fiddle with the container runtime.If you want to take this a step further and migrate or run a Compose project on NixOS, I maintain a tool that makes this pretty easy to do :)https://github.com/aksiksi/compose2nix&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used docker-compose, k8s, and NixOS myself, being from  a similar technical background as the author, but I find myself disagreeing with some of the author's opinions on the technologies. They're not wrong of course, but I've had different experiences.k8s: Installing and using k8s can indeed be a nightmare. In my job, we use Azure, so it's not so bad since launching a cluster is mostly handled by Azure. Setting it up for personal use is less fun. The mountains of YAML you can end up using to deploy even semi-complex services is even less fun. That being said, I've been wanting to use it for a personal project (distributed cluster using cloud VPSs and bare metal at home connected using WireGuard). I just wish it was smaller and faster. Most guides recommend 2Gb of RAM and 2 CPU for the smallest of small deployments.docker-compose: I actually love docker-compose for my personal stuff. I have an intel NUC hosting homeassistant, pihole, caddy, deluge, jellyfin and a handful of other stuff. Everything lives in a series of folders for each service. Backups (both data and code via git), disaster recovery, and just general reasoning about of it is so easy. The docker-compose files are small and easy to read. I also find docker-compose to be about as immutable as you'd like it - version control your docker-compose directories, pin your image SHAs, and you're in a good place. Or don't, and it will still work pretty well.NixOS: I've done it. I installed it on my Framework Laptop since it was all the rage at the t ime. I lived with it for about a year, and it was okay - for day-to-day use - AFTER I had spent weeks learning how to use NixOS. I will freely admit it's an awesome technology in some respects. But the documentation just was not there. It was way too hard to learn how to do even basic tasks. I thought nix flakes might be the "aha" moment I was looking for, but I gave up trying to get that to work after a couple of days of troubleshooting. Don't even get me started on trying to package up something from scratch. As a random example, I googled "packaging python for nix" and the top result [1] is just way too complex for something that should be pretty simple. The example includes some abomination of a .nix file with inline bash and python scripts.I don't really know where I'm going with this. I really do like the idea of NixOS. I just wish it was much, much easier to reason about. Curious to hear what others make of this.[1](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Python)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it's great to document this, and some people are going to prefer working with containers no matter what. That said, personally I've moved away from it and these days I just use nixos modules and run all of the services on my home server directly on the host. You don't get the same isolation that you might get with proper containers, and that might be an issue for production machines, but I find the simplicity is a win for a home server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42323235</guid></item><item><title>37.

She was the only one in the family who would've done it.I'm grateful I was able to show off a very simplistic 'choose your own adventure' type program to her before she died.  It was mostly ASCII art, more of a proof of concept and less than 10 screens, but still.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote a Zork-style text game in high school as an end-of-year project on a TRS80 model III, using its built-in BASIC. There were three stages of the game, and all was going well until I ran out of RAM. :( Stage 1 was complete, though. For being an elective, I put a lot of work into that game.

&lt;p&gt;A judge has rejected a plea deal proposed by Boeing related to the company's involvement in two fatal 737 MAX crashes. The plea deal aimed to resolve criminal charges against the aerospace giant, but the judge found it unacceptable, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency. This decision underscores ongoing concerns about safety practices and regulatory oversight within Boeing, as the company seeks to move forward from the crises that severely impacted its reputation and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

We discuss this ad nauseam every time a post about them makes it to the front page.  I think this is a sign that their reputation is beginning to be worth less, and more people in the system are going to be more critical.  This one case won't penalize Boeing enough that they return to a more quality focused culture.  Maybe there aren't enough legal penalties to do so.  I wish I could see a feasible path to Boeing redemption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boeing took a nose dive in standards and quality when they replaced people who understood engineering and product fundamentals with bottom-line focused MBAs. I hope Boeing serves as a cautionary tale for other companies, most others are not “too big to fail”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;O’Connor said the settlement’s provisions for choosing an independent monitor improperly required considering the race of the person appointed and minimized his role in the process.How did considering the race of the person appointed even come up?I can't imagine either side thinking there was some kind of advantage to doing so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330454</guid></item><item><title>39.

From my understanding, Lambda and theirs bench used different models - LLama 405B and Mistral 123B - with different bench and inference libs. Since the study is focused on memory-hungry scenario, I am really curious to know why they took H100 instead of H200.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bit weird to show $ per 1M tokens and not include the actual costs of the systems anywhere.It would be interesting to know the outright prices for those systems as well as their hourly rental rates at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great read. Have you compared performance with other Llama models (3, 3.2) or have you just done benchmarking with 3.1?Is there some intuition as to why 3.1 might outperform 3.2 on MI300X?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42329879</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the reasons behind the perceived dullness of contemporary fashion, suggesting that clothing has become more uniform and commercialized over time. It examines factors such as the rise of fast fashion, the influence of social media, and a focus on mass appeal over individuality, arguing that these elements have contributed to a homogenization of style. The piece calls for a return to personal expression and creativity in clothing, emphasizing the importance of artistic diversity in fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there are a couple of important things missing from this article. One is that until relatively recently clothing served a very different function to that of today.In Europe, in our grandparents’ or even parents’ childhoods - as late even as the 1970s - housing and transport was very different to how it is now. Clothing was largely purpose-specific; people had far fewer clothes than today but those clothes had more specific purposes. For men that mean different weights of woollen suits for spring and autumn versus winter, and linen suits for summer.Houses weren’t so well insulated or heated so you dressed to stay warm. With cars less common, you dressed for the outdoors. Hats weren’t fashion statements: they were to help keep you dry and warm.Go back 100+ years and roads were much worse, people travelled by horse.Capes, gloves, boots: things like this were all a defence against mud and rain and weather. If you were riding a horse you needed something like a cape with a high collar  to stop your back and face getting splattered with mud thrown up by the horse’s hooves.But more importantly, at the wealthy end of society, dressing was an indication of status and leisure. The clothes in the first picture are clearly somewhat impractical, but that doesn’t matter if your only task for the day is to sit and talk or stroll gently. If you have a team of people to dress you and look after your clothing you can wear impractical layers of clothing that seem ridiculous today. Those layers were still designed to serve a purpose - largely keeping warm - but the application and design of that purpose became exaggerated as purpose took a subsidiary role to status.Many countries also had “sumptuary laws” which forbid lower classes of people from using certain fabrics or colours or dressing in particular ways. This meant that clothing for the higher classes was an articulation of power and status: in the 17th century you could tell instantly from someone’s style of dress whether they were a peasant, farmer, merchant, or aristocrat. That articulation of status - for the highest classes - meant that clothing was designed to show off the elements of dress that were reserved to that class of people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bet you'd find a lot more variety in a random sample of 100 people today than you would in, say, the 17th century. I think the way he's framing this is weird. He's comparing drawings of aristocratic costumes that were notable enough to archive for posterity, as well as pictures of people's  ceremonial garb (and best going-to-meeting clothes) with an unevidenced claim that people today all dress alike (do they?). To make an apples-to-apples comparison, compare those historical clothes with NY Fashion Week, or Cosplayers. Or, compare the surviving wool trousers and tunics of a medieval peasant with a picture of what people today are wearing in the average subway car or grocery store.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did clothes ever become NOT boring in the first place? 
Clothes are above all something that warms/protects/hides us from the world. Aesthetic contemplations are really just an afterthought. Also, "fashion" is one of the stupidest things ever, like oh hey, you should now replace your perfectly good clothes every season because someone says so??&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317866</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of naming and identity, focusing on how people often associate names with specific characteristics or judgments. It reflects on the author's personal experiences with their own name and how it has influenced their interactions and perceptions. The piece encourages readers to think critically about the significance of names and the stories attached to them, ultimately emphasizing the importance of looking beyond labels to understand individuals more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really don’t like this idea if you are sharing this code base with anyone else.I work in one of the magnificent seven and the culture here is codename crazy.  Everything has code names, of course: every project, every release of every project, every component or subservice of every project, every internal tool, and often minor features that address some one-off problem in any of the above.I am sure that these names solve some kind of brevity problem for the people on those immediate teams, but it is a nightmare for everyone else.It is impossible to reason about or even understand have the statements made by members of other teams in a meeting or communication because every other word they use is a code name for something that you’ve never heard of and the name doesn’t bear any resemblance to what it represents. It drives complexity through the roof.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;… a company I once worked at named everything after characters from a certain TV show. Effectively the same as a made up name. Let's just say one of the character's name was … a tough one to pronounce. And it caused endless "what's a … Kep?" type questions.The CTO at some point later on decreed "enough; descriptive names, not made up things" … and the experience was such that I agreed with the decree, and I've sort of felt that way ever since. I've given a few names sparingly to a few things, but mostly a.) they have some connection to the named thing and b.) I reach for it when the purpose isn't clear yet and thus "descriptive" can be hard to come by.You could have named it a "PoMo" (portmanteau of position-move), if you're tired of typing.I'm also a bit surprised since the examples are Rust? Some of the naming is sort of "Hungarian notation"-esque. Why not let the type carry that information, and strike it from the name?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it occurs often enough, yes!The human brain finds unexpected or weird words a lot more memorable than expected words.grep is better than find "find-regular-expression"awk is better than "execute-command-on-regular-expression"perl has nothing to do with pearlsIf it's a common command, concept, function, etc. that appears in may places, give it an odd name!Document it thoroughly!And don't go overboard. When everything is special, nothing is, with the added disadvantage that nothing is "readable" either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42285206</guid></item><item><title>43.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the fundamental role of certificate authorities (CAs) in maintaining internet security and the vulnerabilities associated with them. It illustrates how CAs verify the identity of websites, thereby facilitating secure connections through SSL/TLS certificates. However, the piece highlights the fragile nature of this system, where a single compromised CA can lead to widespread security breaches. It emphasizes the need for stronger oversight and improved practices within the CA ecosystem to bolster internet safety and protect user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This whole thing is a little weird to me. It's prompted by the ICP-Brazil misissuance of Google certificates. I get that it's a big deal. And, if ICP-Brazil was generally in the root stores of Google, Mozilla, and Apple, I would agree that this is a real challenge to the integrity of the WebPKI.But it's not. Microsoft is the only entity that trusts ICP-Brazil. Microsoft cut a deal with Brazil, exclusively regarding software Microsoft controls, to allow them to do... whatever it is they were doing.You should be unhappy with Microsoft if you're a Microsoft customer. But this has almost nothing to do with the WebPKI. Microsoft could also have rigged their browser up to accomplish the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I were interested in assembling an authoritative, up-to-date list of trusted CAs, would be reasonable to source lists from the major trust store providers and select only those CAs trusted by all of them? I know it's possible to be a lot more sophisticated and that even that can be flawed, but I'm hunting for a simple-to-follow criteria for now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I kindly recommend to read certificate chain and how large scale companies are handle certificate provisioning. Those scenarios can happen if single CA is used and If you fully automated certificate generation aka domain private is generated by cloud provider and public key is signed with their intermediate certificate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42322981</guid></item><item><title>44.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the results section:&gt; In the age and calendar time stratified Cox proportional hazards models, no significant associations were observed between total chocolate consumption and risk of T2D in the pooled dataset (table 3). After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary risk factors, we found that participants who consumed ≥5 servings/week of any chocolate showed a 10% (95% CI 2% to 17%; P trend=0.07) lower relative risk of T2D compared with those who never or rarely consumed chocolate.To me, this sounds like there was no correlation, but after weighing the data by other factors (including BMI, according to the methods section) a correlation appears. Does that mean if members of a subgroup eat lots of chocolate, but also have much higher BMIs, because they also eat lots of everthing else, they could have a lower adjusted risk for type 2 diabetes, even if they actually have a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes? Am I misinterpreting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigator initiated grants from Mars Edge i.e. the Chocolate candy company.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent scientific research suggesting that Venus may have conditions suitable for supporting life, particularly focusing on the presence of water in its atmosphere. Researchers have analyzed data indicating that certain regions of Venus's atmosphere might harbor microbial life, despite the planet's harsh surface conditions. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Venus as a completely inhospitable environment and highlight the potential for further exploration and study to better understand its capabilities to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can terraform Venus, it is not that difficult. Venus is extraordinarily hot, and has a very thick atmosphere. The pressure and temperature on the ground are both immense. But there's an intervention that we can perform that is close to our current technological capabilities. If we put a large sunshade in front of Venus, so we decrease the amount of light that comes from the Sun and hits Venus, then we can cool off the planet. If we cool it to -80 °C the CO2 from the atmosphere will freeze and turn into dry ice and fall and settle on the ground. The remaining part of the atmosphere will be N2, at roughly the same pressure as on Earth. The albedo from the dry ice could be enough that the solar shade might not be needed anymore.How much would such a sun shade weight? Current solar sails weigh between 3 and 5 grams per m2, so 1g/m2 is probably possible in the near future. That is one ton per km2. The radius of Mars is 6000 km, so the area of the cross-section is about 100 million km2. To obscure a few percent of that would take a few million tons of material. That's a lot, but a million ton is the cargo capacity of 5000 Starships. It's not completely impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should still be looking at Venus cloud cities, they are much better than Mars, with at least as a magnetosphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42301049</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The FreeBSD Foundation's project on OCI Container Support aims to enhance FreeBSD's compatibility with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards, enabling the creation and management of OCI-compliant containers. The initiative is focused on developing tools and libraries that facilitate the use of containers on FreeBSD systems, thereby expanding the utility and deployment of FreeBSD in cloud and virtualization environments. The project emphasizes collaboration with the broader Open Source community to foster innovation and streamline container workflows on FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that FreeBSD 14.2 has been released I plan on moving some of my Linux podmans over to FreeBSD to see how well things are working.I am also curious if we can use these smaller OCI images as normal thin jails, It seems like it from first glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linked lightning talk introducing this.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem is people having devices monitor different metrics of their body without the knowledge to know what to do about what they see.As mentioned in the article, wearables monitoring heart rate variability do quite a good job of telling people ahead of time that your body might be trying to fight something. During covid devices monitoring HRV would spike before people started to present with the symptoms of COVID-19.Monitoring every aspect of your body and going to the hospital at any sign of "out of baseline" metrics is silly. There will always be a group of people that get a "high heart rate" notification and think its an emergency, or start to make generalised diagnosis of issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I have high blood pressure (middle age it seems sucks), and have been under a cardiologist for 18 months. The first thing he said was “this wearable is good”, so of course I bought it and it’s been on my wrist consistently.The company is legit but has made considerable effort not to allow the data out of their eco-system (exports only to pdf, no ability to send to Apple Health etc).So I notice that I send a quarters worth of pdfs to the doctor, whose secretary prints them out and he flips through them with a strange expression trying to work out what’s going on.I have taken a few frustrating lunchtimes to parse out the pdfs and have gotten to the point I can get the data and graph it - but what to usefully do with it is interestingCompany: Aktiia - look for mikado-aktiia on github&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked in research on wearables for more than a decade, including research with medical doctors.  The number one reason we got from doctors about not using wearable data was that they didn't know what to do with it, what it meant.  If blood pressure is too high when they've had you sit still for a while and taken a measurement in their office with their machine, they know how to interpret that.  If you show them a continuous blood pressure trace from a persons whole day, they have no idea what to do with it.  How much should your BP go up when you are doing something strenuous?  How much should it go down when you sleep?  They don't know.  The volume of data also dismayed them.  Present a years worth of heart rate data and who has time to look through it all and understand what it means?  You need to know the context of the readings, what the person was doing, what was going on in the environment, even what the person was thinking, and wearable data comes with little context (mainly just accelerometer and gyro data, but it can't tell if you are eating dinner or watching tv or typing on a keyboard).  The UI's for looking at the long term data are terrible, and it requires a lot of processing power to get a reasonable response time, and there is no ability to query the data, such as looking for time-offset correlations between one type of reading and another.  The data just is not very usable without context.  A person looking at their own data for the day remembers the context, what they did that day, but how about a month ago?  A year ago?  Sensor accuracy still needs improvement also (e.g., did your body temperature go up today because you're getting sick or because you spent the day outside when it was hot instead of staying inside in the air conditioning?  If the sensor is affected by ambient temperature there is no way to tell.)  Wearable health sensing is good enough to be somewhat useful to an individual, but it needs to be developed a lot more to be useful to a doctor (though it can provide clues that are useful sometimes).  There need to be a lot of RCT's to understand just what the data means, what is normal for a person, what indicates a problem.  There is also the fear that if the doctors help develop this technology it will replace a lot of their diagnostic function.  That could be good, but it could also result in everyone trusting the machine's decisions rather than looking at what is actually happening with the person.To give an example, a wearable might indicate a sudden change in gait for an elderly person.  Is that a sign of mental decline?  Muscle deterioration due to age?  A stroke?  Or were they playing baseball two days ago with a grandchild and injured themselves?  New shoes?  It could be any of these and more besides.  If the machine does not evaluate all the possibilities it can only choose from the ones it does implement, which raises the likelyhood it will be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299042</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matrix has pretty good government buy-in at this point, I just wish it was, well … nicely usable. It has been getting better, but is maybe about 80% there.I keep preaching that it needs to be easier to build a client (encryption of course not being optional). The spec keeps changing (for the better, but the changes are often breaking), so the maintenance burden is high. This means only the biggest of libraries are really good picks. Highest on my wish list are currently JavaScript bindings for the Rust SDK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not entirely sure why it matters that silos of messaging data exist, if it’s encrypted like Signal and WhatsApp the centralized model is far superior to an arbitrary and unknown number of parties receiving metadata about messaging. It might have been an easier case to make if Matrix wasn’t an uphill battle in terms of usability and performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:PRC Targeting of Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructurehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42132014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42326987</guid></item><item><title>1.

The website allows users to easily create UUIDs in various formats, including both version 4 (random) and version 1 (timestamp-based) UUIDs. It offers a simple interface for generating multiple UUIDs at once and emphasizes the importance of UUIDs in software development for ensuring uniqueness across distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, like every great magic trick, it seems so simple once it is explained.For the curious, here's the linked blog post describing how the project works: https://eieio.games/blog/writing-down-every-uuid/Edit to add: I'd only tried searching for an exact UUID when I wrote this comment. I didn't realize it supports full text search! Now I'm even more impressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like some hacker leaked all UUIDs.Check if your UUIDs are part of the leak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels to me like Pandora's box to UUID collisions. Even though UUID space is so huge human mind is always so tiny, as it is always subject to some bea5 (pronounce it "bias").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342382</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Portland International Airport's expansion featuring a significant mass timber roof canopy designed to enhance the airport's environmental sustainability and aesthetic appeal. The project, led by architect firm ZGF, incorporates locally sourced timber to create a welcoming atmosphere while reducing carbon footprint. The canopy not only provides shelter for travelers but also reflects modern design principles that prioritize natural materials and community engagement in airport architecture. Overall, the design aims to create a functional, sustainable, and visually striking space that enhances the travel experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wood is pretty, but as someone who uses this terminal, the key improvement is that they raised the ceiling and significantly increased the amount of natural light. Here's a good photo of what it looked like before: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portland_Internation...The major functional drawback is that wayfinding for both arrivals and departures is much worse. The overall flow of foot traffic is way more confusing than say, the newer terminals at SFO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just flew through there and saw the renovation for the first time, and it is an absolutely stunning transformation. Just incredible. I loved it. The whole thing. From the ceiling to the ticketing islands to the reworked security to the amphitheater style seating areas at the terminal exit where friends &amp; family can await your arrival.It feels spacious, natural, functional, and hospitable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We drove over to PDX a few weeks back not because we had any flights, just to check it out. It's gorgeous - I can't believe I'm saying that about an airport in the US - it's just an amazing space. In addition to the architecture there are huge video walls above the TSA entrance that have calming forest/coastal scenes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334323</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the Tokyo government's initiative to explore a four-day workweek as a strategy to enhance work-life balance and improve employee productivity. This proposal comes in response to Japan's ongoing issues with overwork and long hours. Officials believe that reducing the workweek could lead to happier and more efficient workers, while also attracting talent and supporting businesses in adapting to social changes. The article highlights the broader context of work culture in Japan and the potential benefits of this shift for both employees and employers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That sounds....huge. I know many working couples where one would probably take that in a heartbeat. You lose some money, but gain more family time and sanity. Having Friday to finish chores and being able to enjoy the weekend unstressed is huge, not to mention clocking out early each day to be able to pick up your kid and not have to get back to work or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like it's been a long time fretting over falling birth rates and this is the first time I've seen anyone float the idea that making life better for people might make them a bit more inclined to make more people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For context, while Japan has a reputation of a shitty place for work culture, a lot has changed.Not everything, but many more companies will allow for flexible hours for instance, full remote has stayed in many places, and more traditional place usually allow  one or two days or remoting every week.There is a communal sense that growth is basically gone and better conditions are negotiable. Newer companies have been offering better conditions and older companies are having to compete and follow up to some point.This initiative is following that trend. Schools are facing the same "adapt or get shunned" situation where just nobody wants to be a teacher and family/friends will actively try to stop someone from going there.So things are changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342203</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the negative impact of advertisements on user experience and digital content consumption, arguing that the ideal amount of ads should be zero. It highlights how ads can detract from the quality of content, lead to frustration among users, and contribute to a culture of distraction. The author advocates for a focus on creating value-driven content that prioritizes user experience over monetization through ads, suggesting that eliminating advertisements could foster more authentic and meaningful engagements with audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stances like this probably feel good to write out, but they miss the reality that when running a media business, relying on one revenue stream is dangerous. That’s why newspapers had classified ads, even though they charged a nominal fee to subscribe. People won’t pay $5 a day to subscribe to a newspaper, but the ads subsidize enough of it to make it so that a paid subscription is accessible to more people.On the internet, the fact is this: Most companies do not offer a reduced ad load in exchange for your subscription money. In fact, they will be happy to take money from every source they can. The fact that The Verge is doing so reflects that they understand their audience and are trying to meet them halfway. It also reduces the cost of the subscription for you, the end user.This feels like a situation where an organization tries doing something laudable, but still gets criticized for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's why I use Firefox and avoid situations where I might get exposed to annoying ads. I was watching some Amazon Prime recently (the new rings of power season). Pretty OK and completely ad free experience. Except I noticed these weird cuts every few minutes. It took me quite a while to realize that Amazon introduced ads some time ago for Amazon prime and uBlock origin was doing a great job of simply blocking them. Hence the cuts. Same on Youtube. I watch a lot of content there while maintaining zero interruptions by ads. Works great and so far I've never had to pay Youtube to not see ads. I do pay for Amazon Prime. Occasionally. I usually reactivate my subscription when I need it either because I'm ordering stuff or because they have something I want to see. I'll cancel soon again because I don't currently need them and I once again exhausted their limited offerings. Forced ad watching makes it less likely I come back.I don't pay any websites/blogs for subscriptions for articles either. It's not sustainable for me to do pay for all the websites I visit. And me randomly paying only some tiny subset of them doesn't make any sense to me. I'd need some prioritized list. And it would have to be a very short one because I'm simply not rich enough to maintain lots of multi dollar subscriptions per month. And I also don't want to micromanage a lot of payments and subscriptions.The Verge, which was mentioned in the article is a good example of a website that I don't value enough to get anywhere near that short list. They have a lot of competition reporting more or less similar stuff that I wouldn't miss them. In fact, I can't recall reading anything by them lately. I guess not a lot of their stuff makes it to the HN front page. Probably because it's just not that interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The correct amount of ads for a publication that’s directly supported is zero.I basically agree with this sentiment, but one place where it can be a tricky balance (not saying that's the case here!) is "native advertising".For example, a new game is being released, the publisher collaborates with TheBrink, a hypothetical popular game news site, and for this they get a huge takeover banner advert for the week, increased placement on ad units around the site, a "behind the scenes" post written about the game, and an interview with the developers published to TheBrink's YouTube channel. This type of package is absolutely a thing that gets sold.Which bits of this are ads? Well the behind the scenes post and interview could theoretically have been produced anyway, they're within the scope of the site, but in this case they weren't prioritised, certainly not for launch day, it was only by the whole collaboration being paid for that they got made. Are they ads? Yes they are ads. How would a loyal subscriber feel about those parts being hidden from them though? I imagine they would be miffed about that.Native advertising like this has a whole spectrum of quality and the worst native ads are very explicitly ads that have no value to typical readers. However "good" native ads are really just a company paying for priority reporting in the style that would otherwise be done anyway, and are probably content that readers/viewers want.How do you resolve this? No idea. If I were paying I'd want to see that content assuming it's good quality. Others would not on the basis of bias or a more philosophical opposition to ads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334327</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the recent surge in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting its rapid advancements and ethical implications. It examines how AI technologies are being integrated into various sectors, from healthcare to finance, while addressing concerns about job displacement and privacy. The piece emphasizes the importance of creating regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible AI development and usage, advocating for collaboration between governments, industries, and researchers to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42339819"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of people summarizing this whole situation as "the candidate who should have won didn't so they cancelled the election". I'm Romanian and I'll provide some more details on this:The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third party company to present the candidate in a positive light, and the issue is that these videos should have been tagged correctly as "electoral ads" according to Romanian law, which did not happen.With TikTok being owned by China and their imminent ban looming in the US, there is strong suspicion that state actors are behind this, pushing Calin Georgescu through the algorithm, though this is tricky to prove.This is not a strong grass-roots movement supporting this guy, it was a targeted effort of massive network of bots spamming his name &amp; tiktok page on random videos on Romanian tiktok videos to push his popularity (this comes from the Romanian equivalent of CIA &amp; other security structures). Tiktok themselves when asked to comment have investigated themselves and found nothing wrong, though they do agree that there are bots on their network and they've removed millions of fake likes &amp; followers in Romania.In a video posted this summer, Calin Georgescu expressed anti-NATO sentiment which he recanted after winning the first round of the elections. He has also previously declared that we could do with some "russian wisdom" and he's a big fan of the Iron Guard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Guard), which killed a bunch of political figures in Romania during their time. This organization as well as other fascist groups are illegal in Romania.Candidates have to declare their assets as part of transparency and it seems Calin Georgescu has not declared all of his assets, which is illegal. There's also suspicions about money laundering, with a house he bought for 250K in 2006 and sold for 1M in 2011 which is unusual. This is somewhat besides the current discussion, just adding some context that this guy is not exactly squeaky clean.A criminal investigation has been requested by The Supreme Council of National Defence, which is the autonomous administrative authority in Romania invested by the Constitution with the task of organising and coordinating, by unanimous decisions, the activities related to the country's defence and national security. This is right now in the first stages with no single person being put under indictment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Romanian here. Discussions of cancelling the election happened way before the cyberattack. AFAIK for the first time in a very long time the largest two parties did not win and they started panicking and scrambling to re-do the vote count.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So no evidence to show, except a "declassified document" allegedly proving that TikTok gave preferential treatment to Georgescu.I'd be curious to know what preferential treatment means, how preferential, and how it balances out if we include treatment of all candidates across all media, but alas, that is not for us to know. Even Georgescu's opponent, Elena Lasconi, condemned the court's ruling as "illegal" and "immoral".This just looks like a soft coup to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42339819</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing purely numeric usernames seems like a terrible idea to me, because it creates ambiguity between what's a username and what's a UID. It's common for tools like ls or ps to display a username when one is found and fall back to displaying a UID if it isn't, and similarly tools like chown will accept either a UID or a username and disambiguate based on whether it's numeric or not. Now suppose there's a numeric username that doesn't match its own UID, but does match some other user's UID. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see how this would lead to vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just imagine how many poorly-written shell scripts will break when we suddenly allow dollars, quotes, backticks and the likes in username. Heck, even allowing spaces sound like horror to me.On the display side, I'm sure most tools that display usernames won't make it easy to see if there are leading or trailing whitespace characters, double blanks, tabs etc in usernames.This sounds like support hell to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always fun to see people poke the Unicode dragon only to be dumbstruck by its true size as it stands up in preparation of engulfing them with the fire of unintended consequences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42338134</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the things I appreciate about pocketbase is GG's attention to detail with respect to security.Is the string interpolation straight into the sql from the query string in your getting started docs (https://trailbase.io/getting-started/first-ui-app) safe? It smells a bit.From a quick look (on mobile) I can see that the function takes parameters, but you're not using that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found the Trailbase documentation did a very poor job of describing what this is. It solely describes Trailbase in terms of differences from Pocketbase and Supabase (and that's even the first entry in the FAQ), which assumes the reader knows what Pocketbase and Supabase are. In contrast, the Pocketbase documentation got to the point very quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Application server" is an umbrella term and the documentation doesn't really help identifying what the perimeter is.Beside, it states that it is so fast that there's no need for cache, and supports SQLite only. So it seems to target only very simple applications, eg. straightforward relational DB &lt;-&gt; Json Rest/HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42336207</guid></item><item><title>8.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks like it could be very valuable for quite a lot of people- thank you for making it!Just a couple first impressions from your site... loading it on a phone, the first thing I see is this: https://imgur.com/4maP1vV(1) The entire contents of the site is completely covered by a cookie warning. This is honestly quite annoying even for an SWE like me, never mind your target audience.I know at least one older person who doesn't understand these cookie modals at all and refuses to touch them. They either continue using the site in the background without accepting/rejecting(!), or if that's not possible they just leave the site.I'd suggest you carefully check whether you actually need this modal at all. If the only cookies you use are technically necessary, then (based on my layman understanding of the law) you don't need to show it. If you absolutely must use tracking cookies, then maybe consider a more subtle approach that allows the user to continue reading the page without deciding.(2) "Join Now" makes it sound like I'm signing up to a subscription, rather than making a one-off payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;Our parents and elderly relatives didn't grow up with smartphones.Neither did about half of the millennials, so why don't they need similar help?I don't think the qualifier is age, rather it is prior computer experience.  I am elderly, and only started using a smartphone (as opposed to feature phone) about four years ago, but I have had my hands on computer keyboards for over 50 years, so learning to use all the basic features of a smartphone didn't require any help.Likewise, many millennials did grow up using computers.  If you already understand basics on a PC like bootup, shutdown, login, system settings, installing a program, starting a program, finding a program, copy/paste, upload/download, the smartphone should not present much of a challenge.  Otherwise, learning a smartphone is mostly just learning how to use a computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I just watched the power phone on / off preview, and it has the issues which I assumed it would have.Long-press to turn on a powered-off phone is not a standard. Even I don't know how to turn these devices on, so I do a combination of multiple short presses, multiple long presses until it works.Powering the phone off via the button won't work on modern phones, since the hardware power button has become the tool to invoke an assistant. You need to swipe down the notifications twice and use the software power button from there.In this room I have 6 Android devices from different manufacturers.Then there are so many OS differences between all the vendors, that it becomes almost impossible to teach someone who doesn't know how Android generally works if it isn't on their own device.But I congratulate him for doing these videos and hope that the elderly manage to learn from the course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42331660</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to install Docker natively on an Android phone, enabling it to function as a home server. It outlines the prerequisites, including a suitable Android version and specific applications, and details the installation process step-by-step. Additionally, it describes how to utilize Docker for various server tasks, highlighting the benefits of containerization for lightweight and efficient resource management on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I thought it was about installing Docker on Android, but it's about installing postmarketOS on a phone. Then yes, you have a regular Linux (although based on musl, instead of usual glibc) on which you can install Docker.If you are going to setup a server on a phone, it might indeed be a good idea to avoid Android, mainly because of how aggressive the OOM killer can be with background apps.On Android, killing a background app is not so much of an issue (caveat: [1]), they are designed for this. But you don't want your service or even your ssh deamon to be killed by Android.Now, I don't know how running the phone 24/24 7/7 plugged in is going to last in the long run, especially concerning the battery. Has someone tried this?[edit: see below comments, the post actually advises removing the battery][1] https://dontkillmyapp.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those looking for cheap portable servers, the majority of the Motorola G series phones with Android 14  including models under 120 USD have a battery charge limiter down to 60% adjustable.At 60%, the battery will drop to 45% percent before recharging to the specified percentage for coulomb counter drift compensation.Most lithium UPS avoid this by using LiFePO4.Moto G04 with 128GB Storage (UFS - 400MB/s read/write), 4GB RAM and 2TB capable SDcard UHS-I slot is just 90 USD.ZRAM is enabled by default at 2GB and 2GB storage swap, it's adjustable under "RAM boost" setting.Disabling the app background killer is one toggle away for Termux.No root required.Wi-Fi does around 350Mbit with no buffer bloat, and supports simulatenous softAP and station mode with a dedicated DHCP by enabling hotspot without mobile data. This is useful for out of band management, e.g if Wi-Fi AP goes down, there is a small hiccup though.You can combine Speedify and Tailscale (for NAT) to have 99% uptime with seamless failover since there is a mobile modem in there. ;)The Type-C port is dual role and will charge from a powered hub in host mode. However connected devices power is disrupted for a split second if the charger is removed, so the phone isn't really a UPS for external peripherals unless you don't mind the brief reconnection.I do hope a Pi A+ or something similar and popular exist in the future at a reasonable price, considering that we have phones that are cheaper than the Pis while missing GPIO but adding camera, speaker, screen, case, charger, LTE, and a headphone jack which was also removed on the Pi 5 (USB DACs aren't consistent with pipewire).Mini PCs vary and they aren't really portable, hard to setup headless, especially projects utilizing an easy DIY approach like the Pi-hole or kit/pre-flashed SDcards.For comments comparing a new Pi with used PC: used Pis exist and are a lot cheaper after shortage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a Russian meme that instantly comes to my mind: https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/brea...The translation: “With the help of simple tools,
a loaf of white (or rye) bread

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses various hard truths about the challenges and realities of the so-called "70 problem," which refers to the complexities and difficulties faced in personal and professional growth. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging these challenges rather than ignoring them, suggesting that understanding and addressing these truths can lead to better outcomes. The piece offers insights and reflections aimed at motivating readers to confront these issues head-on and provides practical advice for navigating the obstacles to achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Again one of the few advantages of having been round the sun a few more times than most is this isn’t the first time this has happened.Packages were supposed to replace programming. They got you 70% of the way there as well.Same with 4GLs, Visual
Coding, CASE tools, even Rails and the rest of the opinionated web tools.Every generation has to learn “There is no silver bullet”.Even though Fred Brooks explained why in 1986. There are essential tasks and there are accidental tasks. The tools really only help with the accidental tasks.AI is a fabulous tool that is way more flexible than previous attempts because I can just talk to it in English and it covers every accidental issue you can imagine. But it can’t do the essential work of complexity management for the same reason it can’t prove an unproven maths problem.As it stands we still need human brains to do those things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team"That's a perfect summary, in my opinion. Both junior devs and AI tools tend to write buggy and overly verbose code. In both cases, you have to carefully review their code before merging, which takes time away from all the senior members of the team. But for a dedicated and loyal coworker, I'm willing to sacrifice some of my productivity to help them grow, because I know they'll help me back in the future. But current AI tools cannot learn from feedback. That means with AI, I'll be reviewing the exact same beginner's mistakes every time.And that means time spent on proofreading AI output is mostly wasted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worry about 2 main pitfalls for junior devs, one more tractable than the other.Firstly there is the double edged sword of AI when learning. The easy path is to use it as a  way to shortcut learning, to get the juice without the pressing, skipping the discomfort of not knowing how to do something. But that's obviously skipping the learning too. The discomfort is necessary. On the flip side, if one uses an llm as a mentor who has all the time in the world for you, you can converse with it to get a deeper understanding, to get feedback, to unearth unknown unknowns etc. So there is an opportunity for the wise and motivated to get accelerated learning if they can avoid the temptation of a crutch.The less tractable problem is hiring. Why does a company hire junior devs? Because there is a certain proportion of work which doesn't take as much experience and would waste more senior developers time. If AI takes away the lower skill tasks previously assigned to juniors, companies will be less inclined to pay for them.Of course if nobody invests in juniors, where will the mid and senior developers of tomorrow come from? But that's a tragedy of the commons situation, few companies will wish to invest in developers who are likely to move on before they reap the rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42336553</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges facing Intel, particularly the decline in its market dominance and technological leadership in the semiconductor industry. It highlights key factors contributing to Intel's struggles, such as manufacturing delays, increased competition from companies like AMD and NVIDIA, and difficulties in innovation. The text also explores the implications of these issues on the tech industry and the future of computing, suggesting that while Intel's past innovations were groundbreaking, its inability to adapt to a rapidly changing market might signify a pivotal shift in the landscape of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a whole article on Intel's Board and not a single word on Andy Bryant?Andy Bryant was large part of the reason Pat Gelsinger left Intel in the first place.He has been the Chairman of the Board since 2012 and on the board as Vice Chairman for even longer. So yes, all the strategy and direction of Intel's CEO in the past 10 years prior to Pat Gelsinger can be attributed to him.He also handpicked all the Intel CEO since Paul Otellini.Pat was called number of times to be backed as next CEO to save Intel during and after Brian Krzanich 's era. He said "no" every time.Pat agree to be new CEO to replace interim or later official CEO Bob Swan after Andy Bryant's announced his retirement in early 2020. Handing it over to his friend Omar Ishrak.The share-holding part was the reason why Intel cant cut off its dividends the first thing Pat came back. They only wanted Intel to keep handing out those dividends.And ultimately it was the Shareholders or Wall Street, handing out Board Membership to their circles until it is run to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The board’s lack of technical or even product expertise struck me when it was announced  Gelsinger would abruptly retire. They don’t have the chops to be the wartime board Intel needs. They likely have no idea if Gelsinger was on the right path or chasing a dream. I believe Gelsinger was the right person for the job, but the board wasn’t and isn’t. The board would have had to approve of his plans. They should have known what they were signing up for.For Gelsinger’s part he was probably too cavalier with finances and market sentiment to ever sustain any political capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After almost a decade advising on large cap M&amp;A in Wall Street, my biggest takeaway is that activist investors play a fundamental role in capital markets. I think a lot of the hate they get is fabricated by the status quo in PR wars. If I were considering going back to M&amp;A, that gig would be at the top of my list.I'm honestly surprised we haven't seen activists clamoring for this board to be replaced. Maybe it's too late for Intel and nobody has the stomach and stamina to try to turn it around when there's easier money to be made in a very favorable environment. Or maybe it's too early and an activist is indeed slowly buying up a position but hasn't hit the threshold after which they must disclose their stake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334697</guid></item><item><title>12.

&lt;p&gt;Rivian is expanding its electric vehicle (EV) charging network by making it accessible to other EV brands, not just its own vehicles. This initiative aims to bolster Rivian's presence in the growing EV market and enhance charging infrastructure for all electric vehicles, promoting a more inclusive ecosystem for EV users. The company plans to gradually roll out this access, starting with select locations, to support a wider range of EV owners and contribute to the overall adoption of electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their strategy was to build them where there weren't other dcfc chargers, opening up new areas especially around outdoors places. Their chargers are much better maintained in general than the infamous Electrify America (they really struggle to fix EA chargers when they have problems, and they have problems) - there's a long story behind this.Rivian started before the plan to use superchargers was even envisioned, so today some of those holes that Rivian was filling aren't so important because tesla superchargers are nearby.Rivian has done a great job keeping their chargers working, have the software be reliable, just running a good service. Many and maybe most DCFC charger networks (DCFC meaning high power CCS chargers not including Tesla superchargers) really have struggled to match the uptime and reliability tesla SC. Tesla's magic ability it: (1) fix them when they break, quickly.  (2) don't just build 4 chargers in a spot, it's almost the same cost to build 8 or 10.  (3) string them together along main travel routes to make it possible to travel.The entire rest of the the charging industry basically fails at those 3 things. Most of them can't manage to fix a broken charger, sometimes in months. One major reason is they often don't have standardized hardware so there might not be a spare hardware to fix something there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIL Rivian has a charging network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has the US already mucked this up so badly?  Just enforce  common charger standard like the EU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42340000</guid></item><item><title>13.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transport protocols used by Starlink, the satellite internet service by SpaceX, focusing on how these protocols impact the performance and reliability of the network. It analyzes the unique challenges posed by satellite communications, such as latency and bandwidth constraints, and explores how Starlink's implementation addresses these issues. The article also highlights the potential implications for users and applications relying on Starlink's service, offering insights into the evolving landscape of satellite internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such a quality written article on satellite networking technology, kudos to APNIC.This makes me wonder perhaps TCP is not really suitable or optimized for satellite network.John Ousterhout (of TCL/TK fame) has recently proposed a new Homa transport protocol as an alternative for TCP in data center [1]. Perhaps a new more suitable transport protocol for satellite or NTN is also needed. That's the beauty of the Internet, the transport protocol is expendable but not network protocol or IP. The fact that IPv6 still a fringe rather than becoming mainstream although it's arguably better than IPv4.[1] Homa, a transport protocol to replace TCP for low-latency RPC in data centers:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28204808&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the US, there is a program kicking off known as BEAD that throws money at states to implement broadband access to underserved communities. Fiber being the classic mechanism: cheap, fast, reliable.With new occupants in the White House, I expect that the FCC will come under intense pressure to allow Starlink service to qualify as broadband. This article gives me pause that Starlink could ever provide decent broadband service?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed a huge improvement just switching to stock BBR to my Starlink as well. During a particularly congested time I was bouncing between 5 to 12 Mbps via Starlink. With BBR enabled I got a steady 12. The main problem is that you need BBR on the server for this to work, as a client using Starlink I don't have any control over what all the servers I connect to are doing. (Other than my one server I was testing with).I like Huston's idea of a Starlink-tuned BBR, I wonder if it's a traffic shaping that SpaceX could apply themselves in their ground station datacenters? That'd involve messing with the TCP stream though, maybe a bad idea.The fact that Starlink has this 15 second switching built in is pretty weird, but you can definitely see it in every continuous latency measure. Even weirder it seems to be globally synchronized: all the hundreds of thousands of dishes are switching to new satellites the same millisecond, globally. Having a customized BBR aware of that 15 second cycle is an interesting idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284758</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have successfully launched a compact hard X-ray machine, a significant advancement for various scientific fields including materials science, biology, and medicine. This innovative machine allows for high-resolution imaging and analysis of samples with minimal size constraints, offering new capabilities for exploring complex materials and biological structures at the atomic level. The project, which aims to enhance research methods and outcomes, demonstrates TU/e’s commitment to driving technological advancements in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article didn't tell me much about how the machine works. Further searching showed that it is a compact x-ray source that works on the principle of inverse Compton scattering:https://indico.jacow.org/event/44/contributions/440/A tunable, tabletop, Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) hard X-ray source is being designed and built at Eindhoven University of Technology as part of a European Interreg program between The Netherlands and Belgium. This compact X-ray source will bridge the gap between conventional lab sources and synchrotrons: The X-ray photon energy will be generated between 1 and 100 keV with a brilliance typically a few orders of magnitude above the best available lab sources.In the ICS process photons from a laser pulse bounce off a relativistic electron bunch, turning them into X-ray photons through the relativistic Doppler effect.There's a presentation slide deck here with more details:https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088510/contributions/4577523/a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like the new tech here is a "traveling wave RF photogun" used to accelerate the electrons.Here's a preprint from 2020 by the researchers that I'm assuming describes their tech:https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00270(Edit: Removed speculation that the system architecture was that of a free-electron laser. Presentation shared by philipkglass indicates it's something different.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow! I wonder if this will mean better x-ray imaging in hospitals. Having the ability to tune the x-ray to the type of material you are looking at:“This mid-range capability also makes this source suitable for looking into paintings, silicon wafers, or biological material without damaging it. In addition, this source is special because the energy of the X-rays can be very accurately adjusted to the material you want to detect. You can 'tune' it to visualize any periodic table element. In addition, the light beam is reasonably coherent. Because of this, the measurements you can make with it are of great accuracy.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42333243</guid></item><item><title>15. &lt;dialog&gt;: The Dialog Element</title><link>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog</link><description>

Media players with controls:  &lt;audio controls src="example.mp3"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
  &lt;video controls src="example.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started using &lt;dialog&gt; in 2019, even though Firefox and Safari wouldn't support it for another couple of years, but Google's own Polyfill (of which I am a very modest contributor) was top-notch quality and so I had no problems using it in production for my LoB SaaS day-job.But my biggest let-down with the &lt;dialog&gt; element is that it's comnpletely unstyled, beyond a very basic (and very un-Chrome-like) thick black line pixel border with sharp edges. Whereas my-hope-and-expectation (and indeed: what got me interested in &lt;dialog&gt; in the first place) was that I was hoping that the browser itself would provide for a lot of the tedium involved in UI dialog dev-work in-general, especially for things like automaticallyt conforming to the host OS' conventions on dialog/window layout and placement: I was hoping that I could mark-up an actual semantic model of a dialog and the browser would do the hard-work of making it look like a real native macOS (or iOS) - or Windows - dialog resource.I was also hoping that, because open &lt;dialog&gt; elements exist in a distinct top-level layer, that they might even able to escape the bounds of the browser viewport, which would provide real value to the end-user in a lot of places (e.g. no-one wants an unmovable popup or modal-dialog that completely obscures the user's view of an underlying document (like macOS's old "Sheets" dialogs) - so another false-hope of mine got popped that day.-----I get the feeling that browser vendors would all like to see us stop using `alert()`, `prompt()` and `confirm()` in JavaScript (because they block the JS/main thred), but the same browser-vendors really haven't come-up with an adequate replacement: the beeauty of alert/prompt/confirm is that their API is incredibly simple yet effective and also doesn't require the proggrammer to have any UI design-skills; I don't understand why browsers still don't offer a non-blocking Promie-based API for alert/prompt/confirm instead of them trying, in vain, to convince us that &lt;dialog&gt; is better in every situastion when it clearly isn't.
]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the implementation I think this was a step in the right direction.There's a &lt;combobox&gt; proposal in the works which is like a &lt;select&gt; on steroids [1].Also the Popover API [1] already in browsers for toast alerts.

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court upheld a law requiring TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, citing national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership. The ruling reinforces ongoing government scrutiny of TikTok amid fears that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government. The decision follows previous legal challenges by TikTok, which argued against the law's validity and implications for free speech. The case reflects broader tensions between the U.S. and China regarding technology and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the Court based this decision solely on the non-classified portion of the record,  I found this quote to be very interesting:&gt;Notably, TikTok never squarely denies that it has ever manipulated content on the TikTok platform at the direction of the PRC.The Court held that the law could satisfy strict scrutiny (regardless of whether or not it applies), which requires that the Government prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and less restrictive alternatives would not accomplish the Government's goals. That's a high, high bar, and most laws subject to it are found wanting.I doubt that the Supreme Court is going to want to hear this case. The most interesting legal question for them to decide was whether the law is subject to strict or intermediate scrutiny, but that is off the table now that the D.C. Circuit says it doesn't matter because the law could satisfy either standard.Direct link to the opinion: https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2024/12/24-111...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hypothetical risks of a Chinese owned TikTok seem a smaller concern than the Chinese having hacked into and still having access(!) to US telecom networks:
https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/03/chinese-hack-global...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discussions about Tiktok are always dominated by the focus on privacy which is a joke.The real problem is the algorithmic control this gives China to influence the populations of Western countries. But Meta was found to outsource content moderation to a Canadian company that outsourced Instagram content moderation to Iran.This is not about privacy. These platforms have become the new media. Getting your news from profit-seeking American and Chinese companies is not ideal in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42340959</guid></item><item><title>17. Lossless Log Aggregation – Reduce Log Volume by 99% Without Dropping Data</title><link>https://bit.kevinslin.com/p/lossless-log-aggregation</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of lossless log aggregation, highlighting the importance of collecting and storing logs from various applications without losing any data. It emphasizes the benefits of a systematic approach to log management, including easier troubleshooting, better compliance, and improved system monitoring. The author outlines strategies and tools for implementing a lossless log aggregation system, including the use of reliable transport protocols, proper log formatting, and efficient storage solutions, aiming to provide a comprehensive guide for developers and system administrators looking to enhance their logging practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334568"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what would actually kill for saving on log data? Being forced to use an efficient format. Instead of serializing string literals to text and sending all those bytes on each log, require that log message templates be registered in a schema, and then a byte or two can replace the text part of the message.Log message template parameters would have to be fully represented in the message, it would be way too much work to register the arbitrary values that get thrown in there.Next logical step is to serialize to something more efficient than JSON— should be dead simple, it’s a template followed by N values to sub into the template, could be a proprietary format, or just use something like protobuf.It’s better than compression, because the data that was being compressed (full text of log message template) is just not even present. You could still see gains from compressing the entire message, in case it has text template values that would benefit from it.I get it, we lost human readability, which may be too big of a compromise for some, but we accomplish the main goal of “make logs smaller” without losing data (individually timestamped events). Besides, this could be made up for with a really nice log viewer client.I’m sure this all exists already to some degree and I just look dumb, but look dumb I will.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But… this does drop data? Only the start and end timestamp are preserved; the middle ones have no time. How can this be called lossless?Genuinely lossless compression algorithms like gzip work pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many commenters seem unenthusiastic about this approach, but it seems like it solves some useful problems for my typical use cases.Regarding dropped timestamps:  if log order is preserved within an aggregation, that would be sufficient for me. I'm less concerned with millisecond precision and more interested in sequence. I'm making a big assumption that aggregation would be limited to relatively short time horizons on the order of seconds, not minutes.Grouping related logs sounds like a big win to me in general. Certainly I can perform the same kind of filtering manually in a log viewer, but having logs grouped by common properties by default sounds like it would make logs easier to scan.I've never been involved in billing for logging services so I can't comment on the efficiency gains of log aggregation vs zstd or gzip as proposed by some other commenters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334568</guid></item><item><title>18.

Just a simple textlist, easy to read, no visual clutter.Tho for people that like a more colorfull/stylish layout this might be a good alternative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I notice you're hotlinking the images from their respective sources.This isn't ideal from a privacy PoV, because you're basically announcing your presence to tens of different orgs even if you don't click on anything.And, some hosts might not appreciate their images being hotlinked - the big sites probably don't care or even notice, but someone's personal blog without a media CDN might end up getting hammered with traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UI is very nice.  Congratulations on the release, with all the articles about releasing the last few days must feel good.Does not like my VPN / AdBlocker, getting a few CORS errors connecting to the Amazon S3.  If you really want people to use the site would recommend proxying the request through the server.  If you are already running a node.js server straightforward to do, if not still a huge leap but would also want to configure Caddy (NGINX) [or run on the same server and block the port] to run the proxy locally and forward only your requests so it does not get abused.A lot of the audience here is running AdBlock and / or VPN so others are most likely to hit the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42338327</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmmm I've recently been evaluating https://www.kysely.dev after finding that Prisma can't support foreign data warehousing (FDW) with Postgres.I don't really know enough about Kysely yet to make an informed opinion between those two. If you know more than me, can you give me your take??Edit: Hmmm perhaps based on the primary author's other repos (https://github.com/mythz) it looks like they're a fan of C#. Perhaps it's the LINQ-like syntax that separates them the most.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks great.But in my view there's still some scope for improvement in expressive-ness (compared to something like LINQ). A future area of exploration could be to add a parser to the mix, so that we can write:  const jane = db.contacts.one(c =&gt; c.email === janeEmail);

instead of:  const jane = db.one&lt;Contact&gt;($.from(Contact).where(c =&gt; $`${c.email} = ${janeEmail}`))!

The former is so naturally typesafe, without having to resort to advanced typescript tricks. I got half way there [1], before dropping the project due to work pressure (but many years back, so the code is quite stale).  Parsers were viable with caching back then. These days, performance is not going to be problem whatever you do. If anyone is interested, happy to exchange notes.[1]: https://github.com/isotropy/isotropy-db/blob/master/src/test...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really curious to see new DX for the problem of "type-safe queries with intellisense". Litdb provides SQL-like syntax, but it feels like knowing actual SQL should be enough.If the problem is seen as an editor or build-time problem, rather than a library one, you don't have to learn anything new, and you can save the weight in your dependencies.A fusion of ts-safeql [0] and postgres_lsp [1] is the closest I've seen to solving this as an editor/build problem.[0] - https://github.com/ts-safeql/safeql[1] - https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres_lsp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42334379</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the absence of dogs in Antarctica, highlighting how they were once used in exploration and research but are now banned due to ecological concerns, specifically their impact on native wildlife. It reflects on the historical significance of dogs in Antarctic expeditions, mentioning their roles in transportation and companionship. The piece emphasizes the need for balancing human activities with environmental protection in the unique and fragile ecosystem of Antarctica, illustrating a shift towards more humane and ecologically responsible practices in contemporary polar research.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it was practical at one point to dogsled around Antarctica, and it was practical to leave there any dogs who perished.Did this apply to both polar regions? Is the Arctic one enormous, 35,000-year-old frozen pet cemetery?Edit: come to think of it, this applies to humans too, at both poles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;In view of their genetic similarity to seals there was a fear that dog distemper might mutate and cross over into the seal population.Sounds crazy. Does someone know, how realistic this was. Is there more evolutionary pressure in Antarctica to make that happen? Are those seals closer genetically? Could this happen elsewhere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May be related:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi! Author of Eg-walker &amp; ShareJS here, both of which are referenced by this post.You write this article like you're disagreeing with me - but I agree completely with what you've said. I've been saying so on HN for years. (Eg, in this comment from 6 years ago[1].)The way I think about it, the realtime collaborative tools we use today make a lot of sense when everyone is online &amp; editing together. But when users edit content offline, or in long lived branches, you probably want the option to add conflict markers &amp; do manual review when merging. (Especially for code.)Luckily, algorithms like egwalker have access to all the information they need to do that. We store character-by-character editing traces from all users. And we store when all changes happened (in causal order, like a git DAG). This is far more information than git has. So it should be very possible to build a CRDT which uses this information to detects &amp; mark conflict ranges when branches are merged. Then we can allow users to manually resolve conflicts.Algorithmically, this is an interesting problem but it should be quite solvable. Just, for some reason, nobody has worked on this yet. So, thanks for writing this post and bringing more attention to this problem!If anyone is interested in making a unique and valuable contribution to the field, I'd love to see some work on this. Its an important piece thats missing in the CRDT ecosystem - simply because (as far as I know) nobody has tried to solve it yet. At least not for text editing.[1] Bottom part of this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19889174&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical merge algorithms can perform better or worse on different kinds of conflicts (the specific example of editing deleted text is just one of many edge cases) but in the end no CRDT can decide if your merged text is what you mean to say.We go into a bunch more detail in the Upwelling paper about the differences between (what we call) semantic and syntactic conflicts in writing: https://inkandswitch.com/upwelling/Ultimately, my feeling is that serious collaboration is a document review problem as much as anything else. That said, this is particularly true in journalism and scientific publishing and can be mostly ignored for your meeting notes...Anyway, if you see this comment, thanks for a nice piece of writing, Alex. Love to see folks wrestling with these problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this happens because the mathematical, or causal, or entropic, notion of conflicts has been conflated with semantic conflicts. In the past I have made the same mistake, though inversely and was adamantly informed that I had no clue what I was talking about :)Things get way nastier when you start considering trees, e.g. yJS operates on JSON documents. From a UI standpoint (where the UI is showing some shallow level and hasn't been expanded to the deeper level) users could never even see edits that have been deleted.I think that the class of CRDTs that preserve conflicts (IIRC that is when a register can hold multiple values) hold the most promise. Users should then be presented with those conflicts - and it could even be completely visual. Being able to scrub through history also seems like a viable alternative (allowing the user to figure out how a strange thing happened, or how their changes disappeared).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343953</guid></item><item><title>25.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some non-protein coding DNA produces RNA which serves a purpose. We also know that there are large areas of non-coding DNA which are very important for transcriptional regulation.But it remains true that there are large amounts of non-coding junk DNA which is under no selection pressure. It may be important for spacing out sections of DNA or it may just be along for the ride after being incorporated by ancient splicing errors or viruses. It's just frustrating to keep reading this articles about how, "it's not junk after all," when it has been known for decades that DNA/RNA have many non-coding functions and it has also been known for decades that there truly is "junk" DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seemed likely that the parts we don't understand likely served some purpose; assuming they were junk because we don't understand their function is like a user deleting random system files because they "don't use them."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That’s interesting, it’s like the difference between code used at runtime (protein coding DNA) and initialization code (lncRNAs).  Both have to be there for the program to work, but the initialization code is only used at startup to look at the environment and set up flags and data structures for the rest of the code.  There’s probably signaling pathways that interact with the lncRNA genes which are part of cell differentiation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42275249</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author here -- six months ago we launched ARC Prize, a huge $1M experiment, to test if we need new ideas for AGI. The ARC-AGI benchmark remains unbeaten and I think we can now definitely say "yes".One big update since June is that progress is no longer stalled. Coming into 2024, the public consensus vibe was that pure deep learning / LLMs would continue scaling to AGI. The fundamental architecture of these systems hasn't changed since ~2019.But this flipped late summer. AlphaProof and o1 are evidence of this new reality. All frontier AI systems are now incorporating components beyond pure deep learning like program synthesis and program search.I believe ARC Prize played a role here too. All the winners this year are leveraging new AGI reasoning approaches like deep-learning guided program synthesis, and test-time training/fine-tuning. We'll be seeing a lot more of these in frontier AI systems in coming years.And I'm proud to say that all the code and papers from this year's winners are now open source!We're going to keep running this thing annually until its defeated. And we've got ARC-AGI-2 in the works to improve on several of the v1 flaws (more here: https://arcprize.org/blog/arc-prize-2024-winners-technical-r...)The ARC-AGI community keeps surprising me. From initial launch, through o1 testing, to the final 48 hours when the winning team jumped 10% and both winning papers dropped out of nowhere. I'm incredibly grateful to everyone and we will do our best to steward this attention towards AGI.We'll be back in 2025!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What surprises me about this is how poorly general-purpose LLMs do. The best one is OpenAI o1-preview at 18%. This is significantly worse than the purpose-built models like ARChitects (which scored 53.5). This model used TTT to train on the ARC-AGI task specification (amoung other things). It seems that even if someone creates a model that can "solve" ARC, it still is not indicative of AGI since it is not "general" anymore, it is just specialized to this particular task. Similar to how chess engines are not AGI, despite being superhuman at chess. It will be much more convincing when general models not trained specifically for ARC can still score well on it.They do mention that some of the tasks here are susceptible to brute force and they plan to address that in ARC-AGI-2.&gt; nearly half (49%) of the private evaluation set was solved by at least one team during the original 2020 Kaggle competition all of which were using some variant of brute-force program search. This suggests a large fraction of ARC-AGI-1 tasks are susceptible to this kind of method and does not carry much useful signal towards general intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first question I still have is what happened to core knowledge priors. The white paper that introduced ARC made a big todo about how core knowledge priors are necessary to solve ARC tasks but from what I can tell none of the best-performing (or at-all performing) systems have anything to do with core knowlege priors.So what happened to that assumption? Is it dead?The second question I still have is about the defenses of ARC against memorisation-based, big-data approaches. I note that the second best system is based on an LLM with "test time training" where the first two steps are:  initial finetuning on similar tasks 
  auxiliary task format and augmentations

Which is to say, a data augmentation approach. With big data comes great responsibility and the authors of the second-best system don't disappoint: they claim that by training on more examples they achieve reasoning.So what happened to the claim that ARC is secure against big-data approaches? Is it dead?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343215</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use DSPy often, and it’s the only framework that I have much interest in using professionally.Evaluations are first class and have a natural place in optimization. I still usually spend some time adjusting initial prompts, but more time doing traditional ML things… like working with SMEs, building training sets, evaluating models and developing the pipeline. If you’re an ML engineer that’s frustrated by the “loose” nature of developing applications with LLMs, I recommend trying it out.With assertions and suggestions, there’s also additional pathways you can use to enforce constraints on the output and build in requirements from your customer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've seen a couple of talks on DSPy and tried to use it for one of my projects but the structure always feels somewhat strained. It seems to be suited for tasks that are primarily show, don't tell but what do you do when you have significant prior instruction you want to tell?e.g Tests I want applied to anything retrieved from the database. What I'd like is to optimise the prompt around those (or maybe even the tests themselves) but I can't seem to express that in DSPy signatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found it interesting how DSPy created the Signatures concept: https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/signatures/We took this kind of concept all the way to making a DSL called BAML, where prompts look like literal functions, with input and output types.Playground link here https://www.promptfiddle.com/https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml(tried pasting code but the formatting is completely off here, sorry).We think we could run some optimizers on this as well in the future! We'll definitely use DSPy as inspiration!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343692</guid></item><item><title>29.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; “Originally I'd planned on posting this on Aug 24”For context, Aug 24, 1995 was the release date for Windows 95. It was a huge deal back then. Microsoft was spending hundreds of millions on marketing, which was unprecedented in the software market.OS/2 fans had seen the writing on the wall. Everybody already knew what the new 32-bit consumer Windows was like because it had been in beta testing for years.(Things moved more slowly when a large-scale software release meant manufacturing millions of floppies and CDs, putting them in shrinkwrap boxes, and shipping them to retailers. No online patches either because Windows 95 didn’t even include a web browser. So it just had to work on millions of PCs out there.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is typical self-serving MS-speak.What actually happened is that:a) Microsoft, then a tiny fraction of what it is now, took $400 million from IBM in co-developing OS/2 and put the profit from that money into Windows 3.0 and later NT (funny how developing NT cost only a stated $150 million just a few years later and the main cost is in software developers)b) When Windows 3.0 did well enough in the market, MS did what they have always done - they figured out how to break their agreement with IBM, and take their own stuff that they owned 100% and run with it.  This is a pattern seen everywhere at all times with MS, ever since the Ed Roberts / MS BASIC days in Albuquerque.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OS/2 was so far superior to Windows in 1992 that it wasn't even funny. Nevertheless, my company gave up on OS/2 and we had to port our Smalltalk application to Windows 3 instead. Someone had to explain segmented 16-bit addressing to me, and I was totally appalled.Fortunately, Windows 95 came out a few years later with the Win32 API and I pretty much forgot about OS/2 after that. I still feel a bit guilty, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42336440</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the "Turkey Test," a concept introduced by the author to evaluate the quality and maintainability of code. It suggests that developers should envision whether their code could withstand scrutiny from someone who is unfamiliar with it, akin to a turkey being judged for its ability to survive Thanksgiving. The test emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and effective documentation in coding practices, advocating for writing code that is intuitive and easy to understand. The author highlights specific traits of good code, such as self-explanatory variables, modular design, and the importance of code reviews to ensure that the code will be maintainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the fascinating history and revival of Maya Blue, a vibrant blue dye used by the ancient Maya civilization, known for its remarkable resilience and unique chemical properties. Researchers recently succeeded in recreating this elusive dye, which had been lost for nearly two centuries, highlighting its significance in Maya art and culture. The study involves an in-depth analysis of the dye’s ingredients, primarily indigo and a clay mineral called palygorskite, and showcases the blend of traditional knowledge and modern science in uncovering the techniques behind this ancient creation. The successful recreation not only sheds light on Maya craftsmanship but also opens avenues for contemporary applications in art and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Then the mixture is strained and palygorskite clay, collected from nearby caves, is positioned at the bottom of the vat to absorb the tint. After the resulting blue clay is baked in an oven at about 250 degrees Celsius (480F), it is then ground into a fine powder and inserted inside a small flask, ready to sell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chemistry of Maya blue is fascinating since Indigo degrades quickly. To keep the color
vibrant, now over centuries, it was encased in palygorskite clay. If you are interested in this topic, see also:Veiled Brightness: A History of Ancient Maya Color

The challenge has been that in the space I work in (quantum) the matrices are of complex numbers, and for a certain size of problem floats don't cut it and you need doubles. Nearly everything I find for GPUs is targeted at matrices of real floats.Any pointers to examples? I'd be fine sticking with floats as a first step, but would love to see some (reasonably optimized) low-level GPU code for working with matrices of complex numbers (preferably for Metal or WGPU, which is what I'm using).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i’m always confused wrt how shader languages that target a bunch of other framework specific shader languages manage to map all the available features correctly?like tensor core support, non-uniform thread groups, different data type support, a bunch of simd group functions, stuff like that…i couldn’t find info wrt this in rust gpu, so i’m assuming it just tries to target the narrowest available feature set, that’s compatible across all shading languages?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42280697</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can someone explain why this isn’t crazy? ARPA-H is new and supposed to be ambitious, but I assume they are still tethered to reality, so I must be misinderstanding.Physically transplanting the eye ball and having it survive and not be rejected by the body is a challenging feat, but it’s been done quite recently and is based on known principles and techniques. However, that is like 1% of the difficulty. The hard part is making the eye nerves, which are basically an extension of the brain, talk coherently to the rest of the brain. Seems like it’s only slightly less hard than trying to take a chunk of donor brain, implant it in someones skull, sew it to their brain, and hope that they can use it to think. (Yes you can wave your hands and say “brain plasticity”, but brains adapting to damage by routing around it is just a completely different thing than getting pieces that have been mechanically severed to heal and interact usefully.)Is there any reason this wouldn’t start in animals decades before it could work in humans? To my knowledge, no one has ever shown an animal can get any useful vision info from a transplanted eye, and that seems confirmed by the article.Like, I don’t think we can even get cats raised from birth in weird optical environments (lack of horizontal lines) to see fully normally. You need to like completely reset the biological development stage of the animal. If we thought we could do that using stem-cell-whatever magic, wouldn’t it be a lot easier to start by treating minor developmental eye disorders than do full-on eye transplants?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though the spinal chord is far thicker, the optic nerve is far denser in neurons. So the number of neurons in a cross section is roughly the same. If they can regenerate a section of optic nerve maybe they could reconnect spinal chords too. That may be the toughest part of a head transplant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone with optic nerve degeneration, if anyone who works here is looking for a CS person to help, let me know.  I'll be watching this (pun intended) with great interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42335222</guid></item><item><title>39.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something about where this guy is getting money? He posted his bank account, which is essentially empty, and it seems his only current income is $600/mo, which is less than half of his rent. So how is this guy surviving currently?I don't mean to be one of those people that shout "privilege" at every turn on the Internet, but most people with no savings and barely any income would be freaking out unless they had some family or support network to lean on, which I noticed any discussion of is suspiciously absent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If anyone else finds themself in this position, I highly recommend you sell what you can, pack the rest up into a storage unit, and travel, 4 or 6 months in each location.$80k can easily last you 4+ years of very comfortable living in much of the world. Enjoy the food, really try and learn some of the local language, and enjoy yourself.You can do it, and there won't be another window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a moral in this story but the HN crowd ain’t gonna like it: money is capital. Two years ago the author had no job and 80k in the bank. At least half was disposable. Had he invested that 40k or more in a risk-averse fashion (20% s&amp;p/btc; 80% t-bills) his position today would be much better. Instead he ate through his capital. Always invest your disposable savings or income. Hate me now. Thank me later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42344002</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on GitHub addresses user experiences and suggestions regarding the Organic Maps application. Participants share their insights on various features, performance, and potential improvements for the app. Key topics include offline map usage, user interface enhancements, and specific bug reports. The conversation is collaborative, aiming to enhance the functionality and user satisfaction of Organic Maps through community feedback and developer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

Alexander Borsuk (an Organic Maps maintainer, and co-founder of maps.me) surreptitiously removed the license and added logging to the worker.Roman Tsisyk, another maintainer of Organic Maps, noticed this. He undid the changes, made this post, and has now been booted from the organization?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to give Organic Maps a shout for being brilliant and wonderful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ugh, maps.me. That used to be the nice free OSM map viewer until the company went in a sleazy direction. And, among other things, creating a cryptocurrency token. Because that's what you want in your free community map viewer.So now Organic Maps is the nice free OSM map viewer. I can't tell from the rest of the discussion: is still OK? Or has it been corrupted somehow?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343121</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Square Roots of All Evil" explores the concept of how certain mathematical and philosophical ideas can be misapplied or misunderstood in society. It discusses the implications of these misapplications on ethics, decision-making, and societal structures, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and analytical reasoning in addressing complex issues. The author argues that a deeper understanding of the foundational concepts can help individuals and communities navigate challenges effectively, highlighting the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, and real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Knuth wrote 4 textbooks in assembly language with advice about why decrement then jump saves 1 assembly instruction per loop iteration.The fact that everyone uses his premature optimization is the root of evil remark is hilarious to me. The level of optimization in Knuths writing makes it evident that upfront efficiency effort is worthwhile. Just don't overdo it.But don't trust me on that quote. Just open book 3 (chapter 5 and 6, sorting and searching) and go read the tape drive simulations of merge sort yourself. You can't miss the printouts, they're huge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule of thumb. Don't try to generalize until you have at least 3 distinct examples.This does a lot to find pragmatic tradeoffs between performance and abstraction. It also pushes you away from the over-abstraction that leads to the Second System Effect, as coined by The Mythical Man-Month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The point about building the perfect ontology is something I think we all struggle with. I feel like the long lived Cyc project is a classic example.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CycI'm also surprised that they didn't clarify that the true square root of all evil is 25.8069758011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342965</guid></item><item><title>43.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My organization Fight for the Future was targeted by the same hacking-for-hire operation while working on net neutrality protections.It was really interesting because at the time the conclusion of our security consultants was that the attack was just random commercially-motivated prospecting. Then the Citizen Lab Dark Basin report came out years later and it was clear they were after our internal comms, so they could milk a decade of emails for anything that looked bad when taken out of context. Yikes.After the attack we put a 3 month retention limit on most emails and messages. I recommend this to anyone doing sensitive work! You miss the old emails sometimes but it's worth it.I think it's possible we'll learn more soon about who hired our hackers, which is exciting! It was almost certainly a major American ISP, or the lobbying umbrella group they created. It's my optimistic read that blowback from this case has already eroded the practice of dirty tricks like these. More lobbyists and companies getting caught would strengthen the effect.Since I left Fight for the Future I've been working on a Signal alternative that feels more like Slack, for teams facing similar threats. Hopefully something comes of that too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we change to the more reliable source, on which this article is based?https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massiv...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They bought a corrupt judge against this climate lawyer:https://www.freedonziger.com/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42340346</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The IAEA Director General's statement emphasizes the ongoing concern for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine amidst the conflict. It highlights the Agency's commitment to monitoring the situation and supporting the safety of nuclear facilities, particularly the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The statement calls for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant, underscores the importance of ensuring the integrity of nuclear facilities, and reiterates the IAEA's readiness to assist in facilitating dialogue and cooperation regarding nuclear safety in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I live in Ukraine and run a software company here. I still don’t understand how the power grid is still functioning and how quickly it is repaired after an outage.  I’ve been here since the war started, including some of the worst hit front line cities like Kharkiv and power outages after strikes were always resolved within a 48 hour period max, usually faster. How it’s possible to replace damaged substations within hours, I have no idea.Now I live in a relatively quiet area with a solar inverter battery (similar to the Tesla wall) and I have almost uninterrupted power sufficient to keep my business going. Just have to avoid using heavy appliances like the washing machine when on battery power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I grew up in Denmark and went to a school and gymnasium with many Middle Eastern kids. Many were 1990s Iraqi Arab and Kurdish refugees. Many spent their holidays back home in Iraq during 2005-2011 and one family actually moved back to Iraq. In my young head it didn't compute with the weekly sectarian violence and suicide attacks.Now when following the war in Ukraine I finally understand how war can be incredibly localized in specific regions of a country with long-range attacks targeting only high-value infrastructure targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, this is good news, but this is not enough. Nuclear power, especially huge soviet systems don't maneuver as good as natural gas or hydro.
What Ukraine grid really needs are small/medium gas turbines or large scale storage systems.
Also large amounts of electrical equipment as it constantly being destroyed by ruskies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42337980</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of effective communication structures within growing organizations. It emphasizes that as organizations expand, they often face challenges related to communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and inefficiencies. The author suggests implementing clear channels and practices for communication, such as regular meetings and feedback loops, to foster collaboration and ensure that all team members are aligned with the organization's goals. Additionally, the article highlights the need for flexibility in communication practices to adapt to the evolving dynamics of a growing team.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good take on one of the many areas that companies need to change process in as they grow. Bad communication can hamper and destroy a company just as much as bad hiring, bad vision, bad money management.I about the process in this write up though. There is communication and there is discussion. The article is framed in a way that suggests top down communication process needed to change so that a larger company could be sure that everyone is on the same page and aware of what they need to be aware of. Both examples then however name check the idea that feedback is expected at the least, welcome at best.How are we meant to read this paragraph:&gt; “Marketing says we’re an observability platform, not a tool.” It isn’t enough that our CMO said the words in All Hands. As a representative of Marketing, it’s important to me that our product, documentation, engineers who are speaking at conferences, and customer success people get the language consistent. That means I need to show up at department meetings and talk to people in their perspective. Next Monday I’ll talk to all of Engineering very briefly, and later to the docs team specifically.It reads as if marketing has made a decision by fiat for the rest of the company to toe the line. No judgement there, that may well be how the company chooses to operate. What then is the need for "talk to people in their perspective"? Is various department perspectives going to change the marketing language, or is it just to placate everyone that they were heard? Why does the perspective taking not happen _before_ the decision as input on if the language should change?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42294524</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the contradictions inherent in photography, highlighting how the art form simultaneously captures reality while also distorting it through the photographer's perspective. It explores the tension between objective documentation and subjective interpretation, suggesting that every photograph is a blend of truth and personal bias. The piece reflects on how different contexts, such as cultural backgrounds and individual experiences, influence both the act of taking photographs and the interpretation of the resulting images. Ultimately, it emphasizes the complexity of photography as a medium that both reveals and obscures reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284211"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest contradiction to consider is that the photographer has an emotional context from when they took the photo, that a random viewer does not.This is at the heart of why so many people overestimate the impact of their photos. They remember being at the Tetons, awake cold and alive at dawn, taking the picture (for example). Or they remember a particular photo session with a model, perhaps someone they knew.The photographer remembers the moment. But the viewer gets only what is inside the frame of the image.The crucial thing is that it is totally OK to take pictures for yourself! You don’t need to blow some random person’s mind in order to truly enjoy photography. I think sometimes that gets lost, especially with beginners.Often people are inspired to take up photography because they loved some images they saw. But delivering that impact to a broad audience is super hard to do. It requires a far more analytical and self-critical approach than most people want to sustain in a hobby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;To Crop Or Not To Crop?   Point: Never crop. Cropping is cheating. Get it right in camera. Zoom with your feet. If you have to crop later, that only means you blew the composition.  Counterpoint: It’s almost impossible to “get it right” in camera every time — the real world gets in the way. That pelican on a piling out in the harbor and you’re only sporting the one prime? Zooming with your feet isn’t an option, so it’s all about the perfect crop in post.That point-vs-counterpoint is leaving out a critical difference between cropping vs zoom-with-your-feet:  the geometric relation between the foreground and background objects will change.Cropping is more comparable to a post-processing version of "zoom magnification" at the expense of pixel resolution.  Or flipped around, zoom lenses can be thought of as in-camera "cropping" with max pixel resolution but at the expense of crop boundaries being irreversible.  The geometric relations between objects are still the same if your feet don't move in both cases.  (Edit add for clarity:  zoom and telephoto prime lenses are the same for purposes of "in-camera cropping" being compared to zooming-with-feet.)Zooming with the feet alters how the background looks in relation to the foreground subject -- which may not be your artistic intention.  Examples:https://www.slrlounge.com/glossary/compression-definition-ph...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoomIn other words, "zoom with your feet" may get you the wrong composition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of this is not photography advice, because it's not about what print you put on your wall eventually. This is mostly learning advice, eg which path promises the quicker way towards improvement for somebody starting out.And as with most learning advice, both sides of each argument are great advice. As somebody who is learning a craft, throw a coin and re-evaluate every once in a while.Using primes or zooms? Using vanilla VSCode vs a highly customized environment? Putting every picture through a raw converter with split toning vs taking candid snapshots? Using copilot vs typing everything yourself? Flash vs natural light? Microservices vs monolith?All answers are right answers. The whole point is that not knowing an answer to each means that the photographer should explore the topic until they have formed an opinion. No matter how, and no matter where their opinion ends up on.And naturally, online places tend to attract people of equal experience who discuss each of those topics, without realizing that they're all just taking part in the same learning experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284211</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses JigsawStack's Mixture of Agents (MoA) framework, which leverages multiple language models to outperform individual large language models (LLMs) while optimizing costs. It highlights how this approach enhances the quality and diversity of generated responses, allowing for more effective and efficient outcomes in various applications. The use of prompt engineering is emphasized as a key component in maximizing the performance of the MoA system, enabling tailored responses that meet specific user needs. Overall, the article promotes the advantages of combining different models to achieve superior results in AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;congrats yoeven! i have been a skeptic of model routing like Martian, because while it sounds good in theory,1) in practice, people tune prompts/behavior/output to models and don't dynamically switch all the time. to quote a notable founder i interviewed - "people who switch models all the time arent building serious AI apps"2) the prompt router, to properly do its job at the extreme, will have to be as smart as its smartest model, because dumb models may not recognize a tricky/tough prompt that requires an upgrade, at which point you're basically just reduced to running the smartest model anyway. smart people disagree with me here (you guys, and https://latent.space/p/lmarena). the other side of this argument is that there are only like 3-4 usage modes for models to really spike on (coding, roleplay, function calling, what else) where you'll just pick that model and hardcode it or let the user pick - the scenario where you want a black box to pick for u is rare, and diminishes over time as all the labs are hellbent on bitter lessonning your switching advantage away. bad idea to bet against bitter lesson3) both OAI and Anthropic will offer "good enough" routing for house models soon https://x.com/swyx/status/1861229884405883210 . people dont need theoretically globally perfect routing, they just need good enough.it seems Prompt Engine is a little fancier than model routing, but reads sffecitvely still like routing to me. curious your responses to criticism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The small model you trained, how did you annotate the dataset? Because most of the times output from big models will be subjective, and with not a drastic difference in quality. If there is a drastic difference, you dont need a model/classifier. For smaller differences in quality + cost, what would the annotated dataset look like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a pity your homepage crashes and replaces all content with the text    Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42339302</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that fructose, a common dietary sugar, may significantly enhance tumor growth by promoting a supportive environment for cancer cells. The study highlights how fructose influences metabolic pathways and cellular processes that contribute to cancer progression, suggesting that high fructose consumption could be a factor in tumor development and proliferation. This finding underscores the need for further investigation into dietary sugars and their impact on health, particularly in relation to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My understanding is that naturally occurring fructose found in whole fruits is accompanied by fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which help mitigate any negative effects of fructose when consumed as part of a balanced diet.However, it sounds like we should maybe be avoiding excessive amounts of certain fruit. See: A Definitive Guide to Fructose Content in Fruit [1]There was a recent episode from Diary of a CEO with a cancer expert. He seems to have some really sound advice. One particular take away for me was his finding that when the body enters a ketogenic state due to fasting the body produces defences that eat up cancer cells [2][1] https://iquitsugar.com/blogs/articles/a-definitive-guide-to-...[2]  https://youtu.be/VaVC3PAWqLk?feature=shared&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "one way in which high levels of fructose consumption promote tumor growth is by increasing the availability of circulating lipids in the blood. "Glad to see more research on this. Until recently, people trying to sound the alarm with regards to high fructose consumption (mainly high fructose corn syrup) have been dismissed.Excess fructose consumption increases tryglicerides, uric acid. Just uric acid alone causes a lot of issues, from heart disease to erectile dysfunction(inhibits NOX), even before gout starts. The range that's considered 'normal' has changed over time, but I feel it's too high.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7352635/Note that fruits are unlikely to be an issue (except perhaps as fruit juice). Most people don't eat enough of them and they have plenty of nutrients that are beneficial.EDIT:&gt; “Interestingly, the cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient because they do not express the right biochemical machinery,” Patti said. “Liver cells do. This allows them to convert fructose into LPCs, which they can secrete to feed tumors.”Forgot about this. Non alcoholic fatty liver disease has been on the rise for a while now, and it's mostly the high fructose corn syrup again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a similar note...There is a particular type of kidney disease called Polycystic Kidney disease which is genetic. Essentially cysts grow all over your kidneys, they swell up, and eventually fail (usually over many years). There is emerging research that glucose contributes to the growth of these cysts and early research suggests ketogenic diet can have a measurable impact on the growth of these cysts and improve kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343544</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;Acton is a programming language designed to be simple yet powerful, emphasizing safety and ease of use for developers. It is particularly aimed at creating concurrent applications and managing systems. The language features a focus on immutable data and functional programming principles, allowing developers to write robust and maintainable code. The website provides resources such as documentation, tutorials, and a community forum for users to learn about Acton, share experiences, and seek assistance in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

The Github README says:&gt; The Acton Run Time System (RTS) offers a distributed mode of operation allowing multiple computers to participate in running one logical Acton system. Actors can migrate between compute nodes for load sharing purposes and similar. The RTS offers exactly once delivery guarantees. Through checkpointing of actor states to a distributed database, the failure of individual compute nodes can be recovered by restoring actor state. Your system can run forever!&gt; NOTE: Acton is in an experimental phase and although much of the syntax has been worked out, there may be changes.I'd like a lot more info on how this checkpointing mechanism and discovery/communication works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We changed the URL from https://github.com/actonlang/acton to the project page.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses how forensic linguists use language analysis to assist in criminal investigations and solve crimes. It highlights various cases where linguistic evidence, such as the analysis of written or spoken communication, has played a crucial role in identifying suspects and understanding motives. The piece emphasizes the growing importance of linguistic expertise in the criminal justice system and provides examples of successful applications, showcasing the intersection of language and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Popular crime shows like CSI (and arguably detective novels even before that) have created a false impression that forensics are an exact science that can perfectly narrow down the list of suspects to the exact person who did it.But of course in reality it is much more complex. All forms of forensic evidence are vulnerable to noise: sure, that one interesting artifact may be evidence but it also may not be, and the inverse may be true for that perfectly ordinary thing everyone missed. A linguistic quirk can be a piece of evidence but it can also be accidental (e.g. nowadays it might also result from bad predictive typing or autocomplete, or even more recently, as others have pointed out, LLMs).So all of these are in effect just probabilistic filters. And filters are only useful when your sample size includes your target (i.e. if the actual perpetrator is a suspect and you have adequate data about them). And even then they may not only produce false positives but also false negatives and these may interact the more filters you attempt to combine.Forensic linguistics can be useful when you have a small set of suspects that you absolutely know includes the actual perpetrator. But otherwise they can send you on a wild goose chase or hurt the innocent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's your clew (sic) that the article may not be so reliable: It credits the FBI's linguistic analysis for locating the Unabomber, when in reality, it was his own brother who said “hey, it sounds like Ted.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Spellings such as “wilfully” for “willfully” and “clew” for “clue” pointed to someone from the Chicago area, for example. Eventually, the linguistic evidence was strong enough to issue a search warrant for the home of a reclusive mathematician named Theodore Kaczynski, raised in Chicago but living in rural MontanaOne thing Kaczynski's brother noticed as particularly idiosyncratic was the consistent use of the phrase "you can’t eat your cake and have it too", which is usually phrased as "you can't have your cake and eat it too".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42294376</guid></item><item><title>1.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;OP, were you inspired by this LLM comparison tool?https://whatllm.vercel.appThe tables are very similar - though you've added a custom calculator which is a nice touch.Also for the Versus Comparison, it might be nice to have a checkbox that when clicked highlights the superlative fields of each LLM at a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like the idea of more comparisons of models. Are there plans to add independent analyses of these models or is it only an aggregation of input limits?How do you see this differing from or adding to other analyses such as:https://artificialanalysis.aihttps://huggingface.co/spaces/TTS-AGI/TTS-Arenahttps://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboardhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/TIGER-Lab/GenAI-ArenaGreat work on all the aggregation. The website is nice to navigate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great! I wish there was a "bang to buck" value. Some way to know the cheapest model I could use for creating structured data from unstructured text, reliably. Using gpt4o-mini which is cheap but wouldn't know if anything cheaper could do the job too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348513</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okay, so when I worked at Sony about 25 years ago, I got assigned this project to fix our order management system, which was extremely slow, and kept crashing.I jumped in and started digging around, and to my horror, the OMS was a giant set of shell scripts running on an AIX server, which evolved over a decade and was abandoned. It was over 50,000 lines of code! It was horrendous and shit kept timing out everywhere -- orders, payments, and other information were moved from server to server over FTP, parsed with complicated sed/awk, and inventory was tracked in text files (also FTPd around.)At the time, perl seemed like the most practical way for me to migrate the mess -- I rewrote all of the shell piece by piece, starting with the simplest peices and replaced them with small perl modules as part of a larger perl application, refactoring along the way. It took me 3 months and I moved the whole thing to about 5000 lines of perl, and it ran 10-100x faster with almost none of the failures in the original system.As terrible as it was, it's one of the most satisfying things I've ever done. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh, no, now I have to go dig out some of mine....The first really big one I wrote was the ~7000 line installer for the Enrust CA and directory, which ran on, well, all Unixes at that time. It didn't initially, of course, but it grew with customer demand.The installation itself wasn't especially complicated, but upgrades were, a little, and this was back when every utility on every Unix had slight variations.Much of the script was figuring out and managing those differences, much was error detection and recovery and rollback, some was a very primitive form of package and dependency management....DEC's Unix (the other one, not Ultrix) was the most baffling. It took me days to realize that all command line utilities truncated their output at column width. Every single one. Over 30 years later and that one still stands out.Every release of HP-UX had breaking changes, and we covered 6.5 to 11, IIRC. I barely remember Ultrix or the Novell one or Next, or Sequent. I do remember AIX as being weird but I don't remember why. And of course even Sun's three/four OS's had their differences (SunOS pre 4.1.3; 4.1.3; Solaris pre 2; and 2+) but they had great FMs. The best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At one point I considered writing an interpreter for my scripting language Lil in bash to maximize portability, but quickly realized that floating-point arithmetic would be extremely painful (can't even necessarily depend on bc/dc being available in every environment) and some of the machines in my arsenal have older versions of bash with very limited support for associative arrays. My compromise was to instead target AWK, which is a much more pleasant general-purpose language than most shells, and available in any POSIX environment: https://beyondloom.com/blog/lila.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42346274</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The article explains the CSS `backdrop-filter` property, which allows developers to apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the area behind an element. It details how to use the property, outlining its syntax and values, and provides practical examples for creating visually appealing designs. The author emphasizes browser compatibility concerns and offers guidance on implementing fallbacks for unsupported browsers. Additionally, tips for enhancing performance and ensuring accessibility are discussed, making it a valuable resource for web designers looking to incorporate backdrop-filter effects into their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t like the `height: 200%`: you might as well be specific about how much extra you need, because an extra 100% might be a lot more than you need, or not enough.First question: how much more do you need? Per https://drafts.fxtf.org/filter-effects/#funcdef-filter-blur (via MDN blur() docs → link to spec):&gt; Note: A true Gaussian blur has theoretically infinite extent, but in practice all implementations use a finite-area approximation of a Gaussian blur. At the time of writing (January 2024) all major implementations use the familiar three-pass box blur approximation, which has extent: ((3 * sqrt(2 * π) / 4) * σ).¾√2π is about 1.88; it’s generally most convenient to just double the radius instead.So, if you’re going for a 16px blur, add 32px. (The formula would make it 30.079px; so I’d accept 30px and 31px also.)In the first main demo with code: ditch the `height: 200%`, change the inset to `0 0 -32px 0`, and change the 50% in the mask-image linear-gradient to calc(100% - 32px). (Aside: you can also shorten the gradient definition: linear-gradient(to bottom, black calc(100% - 32px), transparent 0%).) Applying it to later things is left as an exercise to the reader.The SVG &lt;filter&gt; element is interesting in this rendering size question: it lets you control the rendering area for the filter, via its x, y, width and height attributes. Their defaults are -10%, -10%, 120% and 120%, meaning 10% overdraw on each edge. Unfortunately you can’t really do height="calc(100% + 32px)" which is what you’d want for the equivalent here. Yes, you could definitely do this whole thing in SVG, using the BackgroundImage source—in fact, you can do better, because you can composite that with SourceAlpha, rather than the dodgy mask-image technique you’re limited to in HTML/CSS. Unfortunately I don’t believe any current browsers support BackgroundImage, though I think IE and Opera used to, and Inkscape does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This always bugged me! The whole point of frosted glass is to be smooth and relaxing, but the lack of surrounding pixel data causes the blurred image to make unnatural jumps in brightness and color when just a single row of pixels scrolls into view.It makes me very happy that someone not only noticed this, but did something about it, and then shared it freely!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These effects are all pretty, but like... there should be some sort of media query for devices that are not that powerful (or their owners simply do not wish to burn through their batteries just to read a website). It gets pretty annoying that my phone slows down to a crawl when someone has these effects on their website. At the same time, simply opting out of the blurring and leaving everything else as-is is not a solution, since that may quickly render a lot of things unreadable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302907</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hmm.  Interesting.  A white dwarf is about the size of Earth -- roughly 1/100 the radius of the Sun.  However, a planet in a white dwarf's habitable zone must be about 1/100 the Earth-Sun distance. (∼0.006 AU to ∼0.06 AU.)  This dual scaling cancels out neatly.  A white dwarf in that planet's sky would appear similar to the sun in our sky.White dwarfs are also indefinitely stable; they keep cooling over billions of years to become black dwarfs.  Then, over &gt;10^100 years, all elements heavier than iron will decay to 56Fe by various processes such as fission and alpha emission.  All atoms lighter than iron combine by nuclear fusion
reactions, building gradually up to 56Fe. All of this can happen via quantum processes at zero temperature.  So they end as lumps of indefinitely stable cold iron.Intelligent life can hang around white dwarfs for a long time. Good candidate star type for Dyson spheres.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A planet formed out of an accretion disk is generally a planet under continued bombardment from further accretion.The only exception that we know of is our own Solar System. Where Jupiter acts like a vacuum cleaner to reduce material that might hit Earth. We knkw of no other system with both Earth-like planets and gas giants. Given how catastrophic the remaining asteroids have been for us (bye bye dinosaurs), this is unlikely to be a coincidence.Unless we find a similar arrangement around a white dwarf, the time spent in the habitable zone isn't the only important factor for stability over evolutionary time frames.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Dragon's Egg" by Robert L. Forward, published in 1980, is a hard sci-fi novel about intelligent life forms living on a neutron star. It's superb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348085</guid></item><item><title>6.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Value increases with # total downloads and LTM downloads on PyPI.While I applaud the OP for the initiative, if this ever takes off it will cause people to exploit the system in the following ways:1. Hammer the package registries with fake downloads, which will increase the financial burden on the registries both in terms of increased resource usage and in employing countermeasures to stop bad actors.2. People spamming the repositories of popular packages with PRs that just so happen to add a dependency on their own personal package, so that they can pick up transitive downloads. This increases the burden on package authors who will need to spend time rejecting all of these.So this approach carries the risk of possibly making things even worse for OSS maintainers.If a metric can be gamed, and there is a financial incentive to game it, it will be gamed. I coin this the "this is why we can't have nice things" law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey HN community, thanks a lot for your great feedback and actionable critique!It was a simple MVP for personal OSS donations, and I have many considerations on how to evolve it and especially to prevent it from becoming a victim of Goodhart's Law at scale. Some of them:1) Value and Risk scores shall include more metrics: dependencies, known funding, time since the last dev activity, active contributors, etc. A wider set of connected but relatively independent metrics is harder to fake. Also, it will help to exclude edge cases — for instance, I auto-donated to Pydantic (it's a great OSS), but such support is unlikely needed as they have raised $12.5M Series A from Sequoia this year.2) Algorithmic does not mean automatic. While I see a strict, measurable, and ideally fully transparent methodology crucial for donating, it does not mean that all inputs shall be automatically generated. For instance, in the stock ETF world, one can generally rely on such metrics as "annual financials" for trading because they are annually audited (although it does not prevent fraud in 100% of cases). In the OSS world, data from trusted ecosystem actors can also be part of the equation.3) Many guardrails are possible: limited budget per project, manual checks of top repos with the most anomalous changes in metrics. Also, if we target the sustainable maintenance of OSS the world relies on (I do!), then new projects (1-2 years) will unlikely get high scores - that adds another protection layer.Given the interest in this topic, I am going to continue developing this algorithm further and expand it to other ecosystems (e.g. JS/TS and Rust). Your feedback here is very valuable to me, and those who would like to help make the algo better or donate through it are invited to the newly created gist:https://gist.github.com/vinogradovkonst/27921217d25390f1bf5e...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminds me of when Redhat went public in the late 90s and did a generous thing with the friends and family round for the IPO. They included every open source contributor they could find in the Redhat sources. Including me, a grad student at the time. I made a few thousand dollars flipping the stock which probably doubled my salary for the year. (My contribution was an early HTML mode for emacs.) It was a really nice gesture.Reddit did something similar last year in their IPO. I'd love to read an article on how people benefitted from it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312469</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've worked a lot this year on writing DRM/KMS code while porting my digital signage player (https://info-beamer.com) to support the Raspberry Pi5. Since they moved away from their proprietary Broadcom provided graphical APIs (OMX/dispmanx) the Pi now fully supports DRM and the implementation is really solid by now.There is a ton more to learn: KMS (kernel mode setting) allows fine control over the video mode in case you cannot or do not want to rely on auto-detection.Then there's the atomic API: Unlike in the blog post, all changes applied to the output (from video mode to plane positions or assigned framebuffers...) are gathered and then applied atomically in a single commit. If necessary you can test if your atomic commit is correct and will work by doing a "Test only commit" before doing the real commit. Making changes atomically avoids all kinds of race conditions resulting in, for example, screen tearing.Then there's the interaction with video decoding: Using FFmpeg on the Pi allows you to access to hardware decoder. They produce DRM framebuffers for each video frame. You can then directly assign them to planes and position them on the screen. The resulting playback is zero-copy and as fast as it gets on the Pi.Another fun feature is the Writeback connector, which unlike the one ending up as an HDMI signal allows you to write your output to a new DRM framebuffer. This can, for example, be used to take screenshots of your output or even feed the buffer back into a video encoder.One very frustration aspect is that there is basically no real documentation, especially about semantics. I guess it makes sense if you consider that there's probably only a limited number of API consumers (like desktop compositors, special video players).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case anyone misinterprets it:DRM here is for Direct Rendering Manager (not e.g. interfaces studied to limit access to content).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DRM Framebuffers are also the preferred way to interface with Vulkan renderers in GTK. For example, if you wanted to make a game scene editor with gnome, you could render the scene to a DRM Framebuffer and use a GTKGraphicsOffload widget to indicate that it will continue to be updated outside of the event loop.In practice I’ve never been able to get this work. Static images totally fine. Graphics offloading fails and manually refreshing the image causes some sort of memory leak in the GPU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42281193</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article outlines six common mistakes that new managers often make as they transition into leadership roles. These mistakes include failing to communicate effectively, trying to do everything themselves instead of delegating, not giving enough feedback to team members, overlooking team dynamics, avoiding difficult conversations, and neglecting their own development. The piece emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and proactive learning to overcome these challenges and become a more effective manager.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This misses the single biggest mistake every new manager makes: avoiding hard conversations with your reports. If you start managing folks you were recently in the trenches with this can be VERY hard. These are your comrades after all! You want them to like you. It’s all very natural. Sadly it is the single biggest cause for dissatisfaction I’ve seen on a given team. Being unwilling to give honest, direct feedback results in underperforming teams and unhappy reports. It’s counterintuitive but very important to get right as a manager. The big “AHA!!” moment for me was when I realized you need to speak to behaviors and outcomes not character. So instead of “you’re sloppy” you say something like “I’ve noticed quality issues in your code recently that’s resulted in some rollbacks. Can we talk about how we can address that?”. Involving them in the solution and explaining why it matters. It makes all the difference and folks ironically respect and like you more for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of these are pretty accurate, but there's good news: giving a sh!t about your people will likely get you 80% of the way to being a good manager. If you genuinely care about them, their work and progression you're already aligned with the key aspects. You can learn &amp; figure out the rest. It might be hard and very unpleasant at times, and stressful, but building the teams that build software is the most rewarding accomplishment of my life.I will add one too: sometimes you only find out you don't want to be a manager after trying it. Building a lead mentorship program where both management and the individual can live a realistic experience of being a people leader is invaluable. I've implemented this program twice now and it has been great for building leadership capacity with people who are excited to take this path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way to see this is that we’re all individual contributors, from the janitor to the CEO. Because if you’re not an individual, then what are you? And if you’re not contributing, then what are you doing there? When you manage a project or team, you’re just individually contributing in a different (though usually overlapping) way.Also, it’s helpful to remember, when delegating, that one reason you’re probably managing is that you either have tired of running your brain in fifth gear or, at your age, can’t. So the way you contribute is, in general, by applying the hard-won lessons gleaned from your time on the brain-speed freeway while letting others, whose brains naturally run faster, either because of youth or disposition, do the fast-brain work.Personally, I don’t generally enjoy managing in part because brain speed, which I value, seems to slow further because of the nature of manager or executive work. When I’ve gotten a taste of management and spent time on calls with other managers and executives, I was shocked to discover how slowly (and often haphazardly) they thought through problems that were quite understandable in an instant or two spent alone. They were all very smart people, and yet the managing—or, more likely, the group settings of meetings and calls—seemed to trap their mind, eventually habitually, in a socially constructed box from which they couldn’t escape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42341506</guid></item><item><title>11.

&lt;p&gt;The article on ollama.com discusses the concept of structured outputs in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It explains how structured outputs allow AI models to produce more organized and meaningful responses, which can enhance usability in various applications. The piece elaborates on different scenarios where structured outputs can be beneficial, such as in natural language processing tasks, and highlights the importance of designing models that can effectively generate these outputs for improved interaction and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a study on the effectiveness of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) in various natural language processing tasks by comparing their performance to traditional models. The research highlights the potential of these models to improve language understanding and generation, demonstrating their advantages in tasks like text completion, translation, and summarization. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for further advancements in artificial intelligence and the importance of fine-tuning these models for specific applications to maximize efficiency and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is intuitively obvious. If I give you some data x and you transform it with a non-reversible function f into f(x) then you are losing information. Repeated applications of the function, f(f(f(...f(x)...))), can only make the end result worse. The current implementations inject some random bits, b ~ N(u, s), but this can be thought of as a convolution operation with the distribution function g of the random data, g*f, that is injected which, after repeated applications, (g*f)((g*f)((g*f)(...(g*f)(x)...))), reduces the information content of the data you started with because the transformation is still not reversible as convolutions can not really change the non-reversible aspect of the original function.I'm sure there is some calculation using entropy of random variables and channels that fully formalizes this but I don't remember the references off the top of my head. The general reference I remember is called the data processing inequality.¹¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing_inequality?use...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My takeaway after scanning the paper -In an ideal setting, a trained model learns exactly the real world probability distribution, and generates data indistinguishable from those sampled from the real world. Training on them would be fine, but pointless, since the model is already a perfect representation of the real world.Practically, however, a model is only a lossy approximation of the real world probability distribution. Repeated self-training would simply compound the loss - amplifying both the probable and the improbable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a mantra in ML that has been around for a while. It's that when training on synthetic data, your learned model is only as good as your generator model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42286395</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow. Reading all the comments; makes me feel the grey on my beard.I'm obviously the target market for this; I touched PureBasic in 2002 and was super-impressed by its performance in 2D graphics on the MAC. So it touches my nostalgia to see the simplicity of its command set in producing multi-window GUI apps in the browser.It's so interesting to see fellows on here that have no idea what they are looking at, or why it's cool. It's a very niche market I think, and this is what makes it a pity. Back in the day we had BASIC on power up on 8-bit home computers, that's what many of us greybeards learned to code on when we were 10 years old. (And a source of shame in the mid-90's - basic programmers were lamers, ASM coders were cool)... It's nice that you young folk never had to learn assembly to be elite ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I taught high school programming for one year, and used PureBasic as the in-class language. The kids were able to put together games and such things after just a few days. We never really hit the ceiling. The real gem was the IDE experience, built in help, etc. That made everything so much easier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure what this is, but having been forced to learn VBA related to Access databases, I've been looking for a similarly integrated solution that's a little more robust. I have yet to find one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42304481</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;Beekeepers have decided to pause honey award competitions due to serious concerns about honey quality and contamination. This decision stems from issues related to fraudulent practices in the honey industry and the negative impact of climate change on bee populations and honey production. The halt aims to address these problems and encourage better practices within the industry, ultimately stressing the importance of supporting local and sustainable beekeeping to ensure the future of honey and bee health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a very straightforward guide to buying honey. If you see honey at a supermarket, no you don't, that's sugar syrup. If you see honey online, no you don't, that's sugar syrup. If you find an old dude with a small stand and a bunch of (most likely unlabelled) jars who only accepts cash, that's where you get real honey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the FDA should build towards mass food analysis. To sell something en masse you should have to put down a deposit, and the FDA should do an annual analysis of your food (via mass spectometry) from samples from the food store. They should mix dozens of samples from different states to get good coverage.Should you fail (illegal pesticides, ingredients differ than label, too much lead, whatever) then you lose your deposit, all profits made that year on that product, and go through a process of re-earning the right to sell that product.For small local brands I'd exempt them until the economics became viable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like wherever you turn, you see a high-trust society disintegrating into a low-trust one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42286030</guid></item><item><title>15. 21 Algol 60 Compilers in 1962</title><link>https://shape-of-code.com/2024/12/01/21-algol-60-compilers-in-1962/</link><description>

A friend of mine brought me a copy disk of his original one. I could install the game but not play since there was a protection against copied CDs with an error message. In a desperate attempt, I bruteforced the exe by clicking 50 times on it and suddenly the game magically started. I was so happy I started a dance of the joy and would then use this trick to play the game.To this day I still don't know how it was possible to bypass the protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folks may also like the noclip documentary on RollerCoaster Tycoon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts4BD8AqD9g .

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance of 4NF (Fourth Normal Form) in database normalization, particularly emphasizing that historical database design practices often neglect this level of normalization. It explores the implications of 4NF on data integrity and the efficient organization of information, arguing that thorough adherence to normalization principles can prevent data anomalies. The piece also suggests that improved understanding and application of 4NF could enhance database design and management, ultimately leading to more reliable systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42350425"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the typical presentation of 4NF makes more sense when you consider the ergonomics of data processing systems when relational modeling emerged. Predating computing, data processing was all centered around "records." Relational databases are often also described in terms of "records," relational modeling emerged out of an attempt to formalize data processing practices, the practitioners of the era were learning relational modeling from a data processing background, so it's no surprise that relational concepts are often presented "as opposed to" the way things were done in data processing.In traditional data processing systems, a "record" was far more independent than we think of in a relational database. Records were hand-punched onto cards or keyed onto magnetic tape to be sorted, summarized, or whatever operation you cared about by a data processing machine. In this environment, joins were extremely expensive operations, often requiring that the operator feed the card stack over and over again (a rather literal O(n^2)). So, the "weird composed" schema is absolutely what you would do. And a lot of computer software was built around the exact same concepts, which made sense anyway as computers often continued to use sequential-access storage devices with similar (but less severe) problems around joins. This era famously persisted for a long time, with relational modeling as an academic concept well predating successful implementations of relational databases.One could argue that all of the normal forms are pretty much "stop doing it the old sequential access (card-stack) way and use random access concepts (keys and joins) instead."Of course that leaves the question of whether or not we should teach it that way... we don't tend to tell students about how memory is now random access, so perhaps by the same turn the historical approach isn't useful for teaching here. But it would undoubtedly be more effective if you give a little of the history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps TFA could explain what happened to math between 1977 and 2024.  Because the meaning of "atomic" didn’t change, nor did the meaning of 1NF. The author pretends to explain 4NF, but never actually begins. He calls himself an "historian", which he might be.  But he betrays very little knowledge of the relational model.Repeating fields, which he proclaims as some kind of innovation, violate 1NF.  They’re not atomic.  Maybe the easiest way to understand it is that the list of languages can’t be used in SQL. If one teacher speaks Italian and French, SQL won’t find WHERE LANGUAGE = ‘FRENCH’.  Nor will SQL join two teachers on that column.SQL doesn’t recognize repeating fields in a column because it already has a way to represent them: as rows. That a teacher speaks two languages is not one fact, but two; not surprisingly, those two facts appear in two rows. ‘Twas true in in 1977. ‘Tis true today.  Thus ‘twill ever be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve seen this design again and again, but not in relational databases. I usually see it in spreadsheets. I would be completely unsurprised to see a three column Excel sheet with Employee, Skill, and Language headers. (https://kerricklong.com/tmp/demo-4nf-need.jpg) The spreadsheet designer’s intuition is that Skill and Language are lists, and Employee is a section header. Smith might have a few rows with his languages and skills listed, one per cell, in arbitrary top-to-bottom order and with no consideration for how language and skill in a row relate to each other—only to Smith. The Employee column has a single merged cell for Smith, a number of rows tall it needs to be to contain the largest of his lists. When migrating this from a spreadsheet to a database, you lose merged cells as a feature and can no longer rely on order—so you copy the value Smith to each cell that had been merged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42350425</guid></item><item><title>18.

you also can't have the nul character in a string (\u0000) [2].
Its great, but it has some strange WTF gaps in places.[1] https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Loose_indexscan[2] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28813409/are-null-bytes-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just don't use a single Postgres DB for everything as you scale up to 100+ engineers. You'll inevitably get database-as-the-API.Now if you have the actual technical leadership [1] to scale your systems by drawing logical and physical boundaries so that each unit has its own Postgres? Yeah Postgres for everything is solid.[1] Surprisingly rare I've found.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool! I don’t understand what the genomic tasks it solves are. What can it actually do?Also can we train this same model on regular language data so we can converse about the genomes?  I suppose a normal multi modal model can talk about what it sees in images in english. Could we have a similar thing with genomes?  Ie DNA is just another modality in a multimodal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42291315</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;FSharpPacker is an open-source tool designed for .NET and F# developers that enables the packing of F# projects into self-contained executable files. It simplifies the process of distributing F# applications by minimizing dependencies and combining them into a single output file. The tool aims to streamline the deployment of applications across different environments, ensuring that they can run without requiring a pre-installed .NET runtime on the target machine. The GitHub repository includes installation instructions, usage examples, and contributions from the community to enhance the functionality and reliability of the packing process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FSharpPacker works on scripts (with extension .fsx) written with F# and usually run with `dotnet fsi`. For the F# advent calendar [1] I recently blogged about how those scripts are a viable starting point for developing an application in F#. Actually, it's even possible to easily maintain a scripted version and a compiled version of the same F# app, with basically the same code. For those interested, it's at https://www.asfaload.com/blog/fsharp-fsx-starting-point/1: https://sergeytihon.com/2024/10/26/f-advent-calendar-in-engl...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice work shipping this! I enjoy and prefer f# to c# but never gave scripts much care because I could never do this, fsi and the repl was not enough. Now? Hmmm I have options !&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a huge fan of keeping things as standalone executable, good work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42304835</guid></item><item><title>22.

I read through the original Titan-2 paper and they were 5X faster in routing but achieved worse QoR compared to Quartus - does this close the gap?I'm also wondering how congested these input designs are - I don't know much about the benchmarks used. Extremely congested designs can take a much, much longer time to route so an improvement there either in runtime or QoR could be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting, on a number of levels. Where exactly does VTR[1] fit into the current Open Source FPGA flow landscape?[1] https://verilogtorouting.org/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42347780</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semi-related: On the old F1 website, they'd post the lap and sector times of drivers during an F1 session (practice, qualifying, race). First it was a Java app which had all the data, and then they got fancy and wrote it in JavaScript, and enshittified it: if you don't subscribe to their premium... website offering?.. you just get colored sectors whenever the driver's finished that sector (yellow as they've passed it, green if it's the fastest time they've driven through this sector, purple if it's the fastest of anyone, in the current session). I was wondering if they still had the sector times and just hid it on the frontend, and it was the case. There was an if-block that was called during initialization that checked if user was premium. Adding a breakpoint and adding a condition to set premium = true got me the sector times!And then they changed their app to use Unity and WASM, and it's all Assembly-esque in the developer tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20241206210921/https://lcat.dev/...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of WhatsApp's features are enforced client-side, which means on Web they just break with DevTools.I've done some research into this (haven't published it) but also can't get Facebook's bug bounty report tool to work (whenever I create a facebook account it gets autobanned) so I haven't been able to report them either.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Martianus Capella, a Roman-African author known for his work "De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii," which allegorically explores the marriage of Philology and Mercury. It examines Capella's influence on the medieval educational curriculum, particularly through the seven liberal arts he presented. The piece also delves into the historical and intellectual context of Capella's writing, highlighting his method of using classical mythology to convey philosophical and educational concepts, and how his work laid foundational ideas that would shape later learning in the Western tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Aristarchus had come up with a heliocentric theory way back around 250 BC.He notably did convincing calculations showing that the sun should be larger than Earth. However, this was not convincing enough for his opponents who argued notably that usually fire hardly remains in a fixed position. Also, if Earth was moving, it was hard to understand why there was no observed parallax on the stars at night. Actually, the first apparent proof that Earth was moving came after inventing instruments precise enough to observe parallax on far enough stars, in 1727, from James Bradley. It actually had different results from expectation, due to the finite speed of light [1].Just after Aristarchus came also Seleucus of Seleucia [2]. He supposedly had a theoretical argument for heliocentrism, but it was lost.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Ar...[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_of_Seleucia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For anyone interested in the topic of Copernicus' heliocentrism, I can recommend Arthur Koestler's 'The Sleepwalkers': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleepwalkers:_A_History_of....While it does contain some speculation that is, in my opinion, poorly grounded, overall it is very informative and does a good job of dispelling some of the oversimplified narratives that are told about e.g. Galileo's persecution by the Church. (Of course since this is HN I can't wait to hear somebody tell me about some oversimplified narratives due to Koestler!)It's also just very written and full of amazing anecdotes - e.g. about how Kepler's mother was accused of  witchcraft(!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a currently ongoing anime called Orb: Movements of The Earth m. It depicts a compelling albeit fictionalized account of the rocky and often dangerous road faced by proponents of heliocentrism in the 16th century. Despite its fictional nature, the show makes reference to real thinkers such as Aristarchus and Occam, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42347533</guid></item><item><title>26.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't think this post applies much critical considerations on the reality we live in. Just pulling some of the examples at the start of the article and giving an alternative interpretation:&gt; Helsing has a contract making German Eurofighters able to detect radar lock-on (which indicates the aircraft may be being targeted by AAW, Anti Aircraft Warfare). This could help make German Eurofighters more “survivable”, which includes the ones that carry Nuclear Weapons for deterrence. They argue this helps ensure German nuclear deterrence isn’t nullified by AAW, ensuring peace.Germany does not own their own nuclear weapons. It may host US/NATO nuclear weapons, but they're not German. Perhaps this German fighter was destroying an unoccupied bridge to stop the advance of enemy troops that were about to kill and rape a village of citizens. Does this now make the plane "good" and no longer "evil"?&gt; Autonomous drone flight control systems for Ukraine, including “GPS Denied” option (navigating while GPS is being jammed). It was impossible to confirm IRL whether or not this is purely reconnaissance or navigating and dropping payloads on targets. However, it is likely part of a kill chain, as even SIGINT will likely be used for e.g. artillery fire.Perhaps this will also be used by the civilian aviation industry which currently suffers the same GPS interference. Would the author prefer a precise artillery strike that disables an opponent or imprecise artillery that may destroy kilometres of land and housing and ancillary buildings (and potentially innocent lives)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm curious how well this article resonates with people outside a particular bubble (vs. being puzzling if you are inside a different bubble.)The statement that Anduril sponsoring a NixOS conference was inherently damaging as opposed to the reaction causing the damage, "When did defense work stop being taboo" etc.I've worked in the US Midwest-&gt;SFBay-&gt;US West and defense work never seemed particularly taboo in my circles, moreso that the work was boring and constricting.Traditionally cautious sectors adopting a particular technology seems like a sign that a technology is viewed as having a particular level of dependability. That's a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; To me, this sounds partially like an anachronistic appeal to big data, an unsurprising marketing spin for an industry still far behind the bleeding edge of software engineering.Let's leave the politics aside for a moment, but is there any benefit to even be on the "bleeding edge of software engineering"? I would assume these engineers are measured by reliability of their product instead of a techstack that looks good on a resumee?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42301580</guid></item><item><title>27.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great job on further eroding the trust from a prospective employer.Require a formal degree in CS? That's gatekeeping.Need to pass a whiteboard exam? Not representative of the actual work.Live coding session? Biased against people who don't perform well under pressure.Take home project? It's too much work to do for free.Showcase a personal portfolio? Not fair to people with families or other obligations.Either you enforce a minimal level of competency upfront in the form of an academic degree, industry-standard exams such as a PE Exam, etc. OR you push the entire responsibility of vetting prospective applicants downstream to the employer—which is exactly why interviews are multiple week long gauntlets.The tech world likes to complain about all of this but other occupations 100% DO have high standards - it's just that it's paid up-front.Want to become a lawyer? - You've got to pass the LSAT, get into law school, and pass the bar.Want to become a doctor? - You've got to pass the MCAT, get into medical school, and do residency.Want to become a pilot? - You've got to get your PPL, pass your check ride, do your IFR, multi-engine, commercial rating, ATPGod there are some days that I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS INDUSTRY.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feels like in some sections of the US like big tech, the talent vetting process has evolved into some adversarial battle of attrition where the idea is to grind down the pool of candidates until only a few are left rather than find some potential new colleagues. Tools like this have emerged as a direct response to that process.What a bizarre way to begin a working relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m reasonably certain that I interviewed someone using this or something like it in the last few days.Lots of eye scanning while looking above the window they’d been typing into. Pauses. Big pastes. One of my excellent colleagues noticed that the candidate made use of exciting C++ casts before ever defining the variable’s types. Complete inability to explain or debug the code just written.So. Frustrating in two dimensions. First a waste of time for everyone. Second, occasional signs of real ability make me think the candidate might’ve made it work honestly. The fool.This, and this alone, makes me pine for in-person interviews. But I suspect those won’t be back for some time. (For good reasons that are out of scope here.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348147</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No it wouldn't, as there are garbage collected systems programming languages with them, already 40 years ago, but as usual in Go, we ignore computing  history.Additionally, just having actual enumerations, Pascal / Algo style, not ML style, would already be an improvement over the iota/const hack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget Result, just allow the type system to express non-nullable object references. Use the same layout, just let the compiler know when something is guaranteed to exist and force null-checking when it isn'tThis doesn't cover everything people might want to do with unions, but it covers the billion-dollar mistake and doesn't run against the grain of the entire language (as far as I know)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this is mistaken. Go already has a way to represent 'open' union types (interfaces), so all of these runtime problems have already been solved. What's missing is just the type system support to do exhaustive matching on the members of the union. With the addition of generics, 'all' that would be necessary is to make the following a legal variable definition:    var foo interface {
        struct { A int } | struct { B string }
    }

It currently fails with the following error:"cannot use type interface{struct{A int} | struct{B string}} outside a type constraint: interface contains type constraints"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305766</guid></item><item><title>29.

There are already good wind turbines for isolated plants. That's more a ruggedness problem than an efficiency problem.There are good reasons wind turbines have become huge. The big ones are far more cost-effective, partly because wind speeds are higher around 100-200m from the ground. 1970s wind turbines were in the 10KW-20KW range. Pacheco Pass in California had row after row of them. Now, 1MW is small, and the little ones have been removed.Here's a video of the thing.[1] No info about how much power they get out, but it's probably under a kilowatt.  Three standard solar planels will produce more than that, and would fit in about the same ground space.This is a decorative object, not a power source. It's in the same category as energy-generating sidewalks.[2] These are Rule of Cool devices, not useful energy sources.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StLyTZazgVE[2] https://www.archdaily.com/911965/sidewalks-that-generate-ene...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would you release a press write up of a new blade design and not include a picture of the blade design?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urban wind turbines seem like a terrible way of producing energy. Low wind speeds, lots of people to disturb with noise and flicker, turbulent flows due to buildings. Hard to see how a bunch of these could ever compete with a single gigantic 6MW turbine out in the countryside&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42347885</guid></item><item><title>32.

When everyone else I knew either had a c64 or an appleII I was on my own and just had to push through. I started with a CoCo II then UPGRADED to a CoCo III, that's how much I loved that machine. The only other friend I had that was also left out in the cold had an Atari 400. Poor kid asked for an Atari for Christmas thinking he would get a 2600 and instead got that brick ;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still have my Color BASIC &amp; Extended Color BASIC books.  I have lost all my shit in storage, but I have the CoCo I with the II "upgrade" (16-&gt;32k ram, and removing the chiclet keys for the curved ones).  We had tons of cassettes and I wanted to donate to archive, but unable to find them now :(  I'm worried it's too late with deterioration issues of magnetic media.I was too young to appreciate what coding was, I could type in programs but had no real understanding of DIM.  I thought it was cool that they had a memory map graph in the books to help you program images - you could literally see the array layouts IIRC.I definitely wouldn't have understood assembly at that age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is for the CoCo 3?
I had a friend whose senior project was a game engine for the CoCo3 written in 6809 assembly. Wonder what happened to him?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42253601</guid></item><item><title>33.

Perk your mouse in the wrong place or scroll and stop at the wrong place with your mouse over the page and all of a sudden you're not reading what you were reading. This is happening all over the place on the web and an apps. Sometimes it's moderately useful like this looks like it could be but sometimes it's just completely superfluous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to see a similar write-up for dark mode. It took 20 years and it still says "beta" even though its basically switching a CSS template.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did a lot of partying around NYC (pre baby) where this rule is rare. There are usually close to 50% of the crowd taking selfies, putting the phone in the air to "record" the DJ, or generally scrolling through instagram instead of dancing. I thought this was the norm, but then I spent a summer in Berlin. There, people actually dance, and are there to appreciate the music. The vibe is so much more fun because everyone there is contributing to the energy by actually having a good time, instead of being preoccupied with showing people who are not with them that they are having a good time. I think nightlife in Berlin is so much better than NYC because of a combination of the cell phone rule along with the stricter door policies, and I hope those come to NYC by the time my kid gets old enough for me to be able to go out again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These days, most clubs which are at the forefront of what's cool and interesting are doing this. If I go to a new place and I see stickers, I'm already pretty happy, because it's probably gonna be a nice time. They've taken the time and effort to think about the experience and all the little details that matter. Generic club hit places don't bother with stuff like this and it's a good proxy to separate the two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dropped into Fabric on a stopover in London in July (first time back on that floor in probably 15 years). I was surprised when they asked for my phone, but yeah it 100% made a difference. Would have spotted maybe 2-3 tourists taking photos at some point, but that was it. Great vibe. Mix of young and old.Compare that to a recent bookashade gig in Sydney, which was smaller but was basically a film club event. 100 squares of light on record at any point (all with the same camera UI!) .. older crowd who probably should have known better, at least according to the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42352825</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Start-Up Trap" by Robert C. Martin discusses the common challenges and pitfalls faced by startup companies, particularly the tendency for founders to prioritize rapid growth over sustainable practices and quality. Martin emphasizes the importance of building a solid software foundation and maintaining code quality to avoid technical debt, which can hinder long-term success. He argues that startups should focus on creating a robust product and a good engineering culture rather than just chasing immediate profits or users, as this approach can lead to greater fulfillment and sustainable development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not true. Kent Back’s 3X is a much better take, test and good practices for what is high risk and hard to change, move fast for most of it on the rest to try to find that black swan as soon as possible.Yes, I do feel this time is different and that I am a top-notch coder (I feel more comfortable sounding like a jerk when on hackernews), 1 year later into my startup, codebase is big, but I’m actually coding faster than ever, as foundation code is more and more complete.One of the huge reasons for it beyond the right architecture is type safety. Someone that was well seasoned in strongly-typed FP but is now pragmatic can move incredibly fast with enormous safety by just adding the most cost-benefit type strictness, and being flexible on where it doesn’t pay off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are thousands of successful technical startup founders and early employees that would disagree with the content of this article.The truth is that, it's actually totally fine to accumulate some amount of technical debt and to ship some buggy code if you're still early. Speed matters. Of course this will change if you're later stage or if you're in an industry where you must be very careful (security, healthcare, gov, etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Is your code somehow less important than that account’s spreadsheets?Shout-it-from-the-mountain-top "yes!"The code should just get you through a demo, or securing the next round of financing.The accountant can't cut corners, because they and other people could go to jail.But the idea that prototyping in software is not a valid practice is laughably wrong.Where you do go wrong is if the people only know how to prototype and nothing else; they can't get rid of the prototypey bits and evolve it into solid production in which all traces of prototyping are gone. Multi-talented mega-begins which know numerous methodologies wouldn't be in this boat, right?&gt; as if any bug is acceptableWindows still crashes in 2024, yet we can't get rid of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42351935</guid></item><item><title>36.

It has been investing in their production for many, many years. It has been attempting to dominate not just the production of cells but also of the cathodes and anodes that go inside them - not to mention the chemicals used to make those electrodes. It has been firming up the entire supply chain - all the way down to the mines. And while you can find only so much lithium and cobalt in China, Chinese firms have been buying up mines in Africa and elsewhere for years.The fun thing is that the west saw it coming and didn't try particularly hard to forestall it. Consistent, long term industrial policy is very effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Europe doesn't make the best cars, USA doesn't make the best planes, Japan doesn't make the best electronics.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses allegations that police departments in some states are selling restricted firearms, specifically AR-15s, through online auctions. This practice raises concerns about accountability and the potential misuse of such weapons. Critics argue that these sales undermine efforts to regulate gun ownership and could lead to dangerous individuals obtaining firearms meant for law enforcement use. The piece highlights the need for stricter oversight of police weapon sales and advocates for transparency in how surplus police equipment is handled.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is conflating a few different things.1. Cop buys the kinds firearms regular people can buy using law enforcement discounts and then makes an otherwise legal private sale to profit from this. This violates the terms of these law enforcement discount programs. Also, federal law requires people who buy and sell firearms for profit have a federal firearms license. These firearms sometimes are used in crime.2. In some jurisdictions like California and Massachusetts, law enforcement can buy certain handguns new that normal people cannot. This isn't about safety as these handguns are not capable of anything that the approved handguns are not. It's solely a measure to harm the market for handguns by restricting the kinds of handguns available and increasing their prices. Cops can legally sell these unapproved handguns to normal people. The problem here, again, is doing it for profit. These firearms sometimes are used in crime.3. Cops buying "assault weapons" and then making illegal private sales to normal people who can't lawfully buy these weapons. This is nowhere near as common as the first two scenarios.4. Cops playing games with post-1986 machinegun regulations so that federal firearms licensees who pay a special tax can acquire machineguns to rent to the public at ranges or just for their own personal fun. These firearms, which often are significantly more dangerous than the kinds of firearms normal people can lawfully acquire, have never been used in a crime.Scenarios 1 and 2 have no public safety impact beyond private sales generally. Scenario 3 is only problematic from a public safety standpoint if you believe "assault weapons" are uniquely dangerous, which they aren't. Scenario 4 has not resulted in any violent crime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; "If I'm guilty of this, every cop in the nation's going to jail," Wendt told CBS News just days before a federal judge sentenced him to a 5-year prison term.I'm not sure that was the gotcha he seemed to think it was...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kinda worrying in many ways really - police taking guns from their departments and selling them to criminals and then saying "...but but I had no idea this was illegal or wrong!"I doesn't even pass the sniff test.Either the police are total idiots with no concept of right or wrong let alone knowledge of the law, OR they are willingly corrupt and will brazenly break the law to line their own pockets and to fuck with the consequences, which incidentally are pretty negligible because of the corruption and blind-eye turning of their buddies.Both options are pretty troubling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42349858</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;Google's DeepMind has developed a new AI-powered weather forecasting model called GenCast, which aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of weather predictions. The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of historical weather data, resulting in forecasts that can quickly adapt to changing conditions. The initiative is positioned to enhance both short-term and long-term weather forecasting, potentially benefiting sectors reliant on precise weather information, such as agriculture and disaster management.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if GenCast's 15 day forecast is really the right indicator for forecasting? I could imagine that such long term ML forecasts tend to get closer to yearly averages, which are kind of "washed out", but of course look good for benchmarking and marketing reasons. But they are not so practical for the majority of weather forecast users. In short, it still smells a bit like AI snake oil to me. [1][1] more about this: https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691249131/ai...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although it's great to see these advancements, I would like to see it integrated with the Google Weather results that show up in search and on Android devices before I get excited. Spinning up the model on my own hardware and feeding it data manually is a decent amount of work, and I'm too lazy to do that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not surprised. This is the sort of problem machine learning is really good at solving. There's a lot of quality training data, and the results are governed by physics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42351698</guid></item><item><title>41.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents research on the mechanisms of androgens in cancer biology, particularly their role in modulating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. It explores how androgens influence the behavior and function of various immune cells, which can impact cancer progression and treatment outcomes. The findings suggest that targeting androgen signaling pathways might offer new therapeutic strategies for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in certain cancers, indicating potential implications for personalized medicine approaches in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been relatively clear for a while. Solar is dirt cheap per kwh produced. The only real technical impediment at this point, as the article mentions, is energy balancing (both through the night and seasonally).It's interesting that uptake is slow in developing countries - If anything I would expect solar to actually be quite beneficial in places like Africa without well-developed grids, since it's so easy to set up in an independent manner - I guess it might just be down to insufficient income to manage even that :(&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The next step might be standalone solar products that are prebuilt to avoid permitting costs and delays.How about a device you roll out into your yard and fold out some giant panels to charge your ev. You get to benefit from cheap solar without dealing with getting a bunch of laborors up in your roof, and negotiating with the power company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related:https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-environment-science-and...from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37934146Previous:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41431901 - Sept 2024 (2 comments)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37934139 - Oct 2023 (1 comment)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42352662</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The article presents a solution for building an interactive JavaScript-based advent calendar using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates how to create a visually appealing and functional calendar that reveals hidden content for each day leading up to Christmas. The step-by-step guide includes code snippets, design tips, and best practices, making it accessible for developers looking to enhance their web development skills while adding a festive element to their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ok, so ChatGPT got some things wrong. If everyone began posting how ChatGPT got something wrong, we will be here all day. I can't see how this article is newsworthy.And the article has constant literary interruptions like this:"I set down my teacup and put my face in my hands.""There was an almost infinitesimal pause before ChatGPT chirped""I closed my eyes and contemplated my life choices.""I narrowed my eyes as ChatGPT brightly informed me"I don't know what the author is trying here but there is a time and place to use literary pauses like these and I don't think, this article is that place. The article reads like a weird cross between a rant, technical article and a wannabe literary piece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I truly don't understand the HN audience.There are so many better and higher quality submissions in the /newest that never make it to the front page but it's almost always some shallow generic "hobbyist" junk with zero value like this that makes it instead.Making a rocket science of a &lt;button&gt; on an HTML page... "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"... yeah.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honestly I'm just relieved that ChatGPT didn't suggest a div with role="button".I have spent the last 5 years trying to get a good grasp of semantic and accessible HTML. It seems like every week I find out I was wrong about something I thought I knew. There's a bunch of blog posts out there with conflicting examples, and the only "official" source that's actually readable is the ARIA Practices Guide (APG). Which, by the way, starts off by telling you that "No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA" and recommends that you don’t use any of the code from the "Patterns" pages because reasons.So to end my rant, I would say that on the one hand, I understand the author's frustration, but on the other, a11y in HTML is a nebulous maze of ARIA attributes and it isn't always clear which element is the "semantic" one for certain use cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348841</guid></item><item><title>45.

It took decades of focused and sustained research by Shuji Nakamura and others to make a commercially viable blue LED. Hence Nakamura won the NobelSame deal with AI/ML.Although Nakamura was actually doing something PHYSICS related!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also see (9 days ago):https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42264069If dang is watching I would like recommend the earlier article for the repost queue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a good article. My impression is the way we think of scientific credit in general is broken. There's too much of an attempt to attribute credit to a small number of people. This might or might not have been more accurate at one time in history but it's increasingly a problematic schema for how to think about how science works.I don't mean that people who get credit don't deserve it, more so that there are often a series of people who also deserve it and don't get credit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42350768</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the backlash faced by the creators of a popular memecoin, Shiba Inu, particularly focusing on the response from young investors who initially joined the hype due to its meme status and potential for quick profits. As the value of the memecoin fluctuated dramatically, many of these investors expressed frustration over the volatility and the perceived exploitation by its developers. The piece highlights the broader implications of such cryptocurrencies in the market, the emotional connections investors form with them, and the challenges of navigating investments in a space often driven by trends and social media hype.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that we're at the stage of crypto where we are commoditizing rug pulling. Pump.fun is literally the pickaxe store. The creators saw a lot of people making money with rugpulls and thought to themselves: "the real money is in selling the rugs"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to me like Pump.Fun should just be called RugPull.Fun, and it blows my mind why anyone is naive enough to buy these memecoins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fat middle-schooler used pump.fun to create "Gen-Z Quant" -- this site requires four inputs: coin-name, issuance quantity, animated-gif, deposit of Solana for the tx fee; he then rugged to the tune of $30k and flicked everybody off on the pump.fun's integrated livestream saying "thanks for the bandos" (bando = $1k)The addendum to the story is that the attention it generated caused degens to ape into 'Gen-Z Quant" pumping its market price where for a time that $30k would have been worth millions... and the rest of the story is still more interesting...Since it got so much attention, people started doing crazy things on the livestream to pump their coins -- one guy made something along the lines of crime-spree coin and livestreamed himself stealing cars -- promising to continue doing so until he was arrested in order to pump his coin.This activity caused pump.fun to disable their integrated livestreaming feature.The story was featured on last week's ( nov 30) Bankless Friday roundup.The final point I wonder about is -- won't this degen activity ( ~100 coins are created per minute on pump.fun ) -- clog Solana's network -- their major selling point is that they have a huge number of tx/s, but if you fill it with spam ?? what does that mean for the network?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42345834</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses PHP lazy objects, a design pattern that improves performance by delaying the initialization of an object until it is actually needed. It outlines the benefits of using lazy objects, such as reduced memory usage and faster response times, particularly in applications that instantiate many objects. The article provides practical examples of implementing lazy loading in PHP, demonstrating how to create a lazy object class, manage dependencies, and use closures to encapsulate the initialization logic. Additionally, it emphasizes best practices for effectively integrating lazy loading into existing codebases to enhance efficiency and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dickies, the well-known clothing company, is relocating its headquarters from California's Orange County to Fort Worth, Texas. This move comes as part of a broader trend of companies shifting operations to Texas for economic reasons. The decision emphasizes Dickies' commitment to maintaining its operational roots while adapting to changing business environments. The company's officials highlighted the opportunities in Texas, including access to a skilled workforce and a favorable business climate, as key factors influencing the relocation.&lt;/p&gt;

The BBQ was pretty good several years ago, but I ended up just not going for a couple of years, then when I tried to the ones nearest me had all closed and the number a medium distance from me had greatly diminished and their ratings had tanked.I've seen the band live twice and both had interesting interruptions. The first interruption there was a problem with an amp and they had to pause the show while it was fixed. The singer walked over to the keyboard and said that to entertain us while we waited he would play and named a Bach piece. I don't remember what piece it was other than it is one considered to be difficult piece, and he played it perfectly.The second interrupted show was one where the crowd at the front of the stage was urging the singer to crowd dive. He asked them if he could piss on them instead. They shouted "YES!".Big mistake. He then stopped singing, the stage crew quickly got a spotlight on his crotch, we got to see him unzip and whip it out...and he then proceeded to urinate on the people in front.The show resumed but the people who had been pissed on kept trying to get onto stage, and security was having trouble keeping them back and the show had to be cut short.[1] https://www.dickies.com/[2] https://www.dickeys.com/[3] http://www.thedickies.com/[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dickies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny that a company actually choosing to live in California now is so unusual that it sparks a headline and a front-page post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42351375</guid></item><item><title>50.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not a dissimilar system to Teletext[1], which transmitted data in the blanking interval of a broadcast TV signal, and could be interpreted by a TV or other hardware with appropriate support.  Teletext was pretty widespread throughout Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.It was typically used to transmit pages of information (news, weather, etc.) that could be viewed directly on the TV, but the BBC's Ceefax[2] Teletext service was also used to distribute software to the BBC Micro, when equipped with the appropriate Teletext Adapter[3].In a similar fashion to the Sega Channel system, the Teletext system would broadcast looped data, with popular pages (such as news and weather) being repeated frequently so they would load quickly, and less popular pages taking longer to load (or more accurately, to wait for the next time they appeared in the looped data).I was interested to see that the Sega system used a bitrate of 8Mbps, which sounded pretty high for the mid-90s, but I see that Teletext had a bitrate of almost 7Mbps for PAL broadcasts, despite being roughly 15 years older![1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro_expansion_unit#Telet...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember Sega Channel. In 6th grade, my friend had it. I didn't grow up with BBSes and had only learned about the Internet the year before (from the same friend), so the idea of downloading games was pretty wild. The service was way ahead of its time.IIRC, it was $15/mo. There was a monthly or weekly rotation of games, including some pre-releases. I think at one point we played Vectorman when it was still new in stores or possibly just prior to its official launch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had this back in the 90s for a month or two. It was amazing. A bit finicky. Our neighbors split out cable outside and it stopped working. Apparently needed a dedicated line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42353907</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;Nyxt is a highly customizable web browser designed for power users and programmers, offering an efficient and flexible interface. It features an extensible architecture that allows users to tailor the browser to their specific needs, making it suitable for advanced use cases, including keyboard-centric navigation and manipulation of web content. Key aspects include its Lisp-based configuration, powerful scripting capabilities, and support for plugins, which together create a unique browsing experience focused on productivity and user empowerment. Nyxt promotes an open approach to web browsing, encouraging users to explore and modify the browser to enhance their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't know, I feel like some of the more pressing features of this browser are already provided with add-ons such as Vimium. And I would really like to see this on a Firefox back-end / compatible with the likes of uBlock origin. I don't want to have another chrome derivative that has a fancy new UI to boast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When are we getting a web engine written in SBCL? :) or how hard would it be, I wonder...One thing about Nyxt that's great is this idea of trying to push towards being renderer-agnostic. I'm not sure how achievable that is in reality, but when you hear the idea you think oh yeah, surely that would make sense if we want to have good things in the world.To all the people saying "I like my mouse! Why are these keyboard people so elitist!", the Nyxt people are not on a crusade against your lovely mouse. This isn't ratpoison (a window manager I adored using for a while, but that's a different story).I have never seen anything on the Nyxt blog or elsewhere claiming mouse-users aren't humans, with full rights, deserving of fine browsing experiences like the rest of us. If I missed something, go ahead, please link it to us all and prove your point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've used this browser for a long time. At first, it was very promising, but later on, I found it quite distracting when I needed to work, so I had to give up. If you enjoy the vim-style feel of operation, you might want to try this browser's extension, as it can accommodate your habits along with normal web browsing. Of course, I still hope that the browser can improve, and I will try downloading it again to use for a while.https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbai...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42354691</guid></item><item><title>3.

&lt;p&gt;The website presents an interactive game called "Cut the Crab," where players aim to slice crabs as they appear on the screen while avoiding cutting other objects. The game challenges users with increasing levels of difficulty, enhancing their reflexes and precision as they progress. It offers a fun and engaging way to improve hand-eye coordination through a simple yet addictive gameplay mechanic. Users can replay and compete for high scores, adding a competitive edge to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I bookmarked this comment a few months ago because I thought it was hilarious and increasingly accurate:It's approaching a very strange situation where people make overly wordy and bloated AI generated content and other people try to use AI to compress it back into useful pellets vaguely corresponding to the actual prompts used to generate the initial content. Which were the only bits anybody cared about in the first place.
One guy pays the AI to dig a hole, the other guy pays the AI to fill in the hole. Back and forth they go, raising the BNP but otherwise not accomplishing anything.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41635079More seriously though; I wonder if/when we will reach a point at which asking for a Neuromancer-esque précis summary video of a topic will replace the experience of browsing and reading various sources of information. My gut feeling is that it will for many, but not all scenarios, because the act of browsing itself is desirable and informative. For example, searching for books on Amazon is efficient but it doesn’t quite replace the experience of walking through a bookstore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much of the trash on the internet has nothing to do with AI, but instead is caused by using AdSense type funding. If you have a site and use revenue from ads as your funding, then the way to in increase your revenue is more show more ads.So add more fluff, move the actual thing people are looking for to the bottom, etc. Oh and add controversy, "The only authentic". Then add sex - a suggestive photo.The thing is that AI can now generate these sites for you so no need to do anything yourself.Finally pay Google to feature your ad - I mean recipe - and do other stuff to ensure that real recipes do not steal your traffic. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The irony of AI removing AI content. I used this for my marketing generation (using AI of course) real estate business and it misinterpreted examples as the actual listings.Also if you use Https instead of https in the url field it gives an error…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42356443</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a detailed guide on setting up a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) lab at home using a combination of networking hardware and software tools. It explains the necessary equipment, setup procedures, and configurations needed to emulate BGP routing in a personal network environment. The author shares insights on practical applications, troubleshooting tips, and the educational benefits of understanding BGP for network enthusiasts and professionals. Overall, the piece serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to experiment with BGP in a controlled, home-based setting.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; While the SLA says 100%, don't expect perfectionWhen you have an SLA, understand what it is: a financial arrangement whereby you can request a prorated refund for certain types of outages. It is not in any way a guarantee on the part of a provider that you'll experience even average uptime equaling or exceeding the SLA, just that they can pay out the fraction of customer requests for service credits they receive for the covered outages they have and still make money.The reality for the type of service the author of this post purchased is that for any physical damage to the fiber plant, he will experience hours of outage while a splice crew locates and repairs the damage.  Verizon might offer a 100% SLA, but they didn't engineer it to even five nines of availability.  That would require redundant equipment and service entrances at his premises along with path diversity end-to-end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ISP I own will give you dedicated if you desire. We charge an uplift for the installation (due to additional splicing) and a little bit more on the monthly price for the consumption of dedicated ports and cores rather than using the PON. However, as is the case with most provided services like this, the majority of the cost is covering the risk of the SLA. The likelihood of an outage is not too dissimilar to the likelihood of outage on PON, so really it becomes a financial and service guarantee more than an uptime guarantee. As a healthy middle ground, we will also offer BGP on regular services and we do a bit of a referral system with a couple of other friendly ISPs, who will also do BGP. I actually prefer multi homing to “dedicated” from a resilience perspective because it separates you from the entire network stack all the way to the transit and peering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know of only a few other people that have managed to get "real" fiber to the home.I am jealous of them save for the "your monthly ISP bill is similar to a car payment" aspect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42353778</guid></item><item><title>5.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed using JavaScript and HTML5. It features a basic game setup where players control a bird to navigate through pipes by tapping the screen or pressing a key. The repository includes source code, instructions for running the game, and information on how to contribute or modify the project. This implementation serves as a valuable resource for beginners looking to understand game development concepts and improve their programming skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Texas have developed an artificial intelligence system capable of converting sound recordings into detailed street images. This innovative technology allows for the creation of visual representations based on auditory data, which could have significant applications in fields such as urban planning, accessibility, and navigation. The AI system analyzes sounds to reconstruct urban landscapes, highlighting how auditory information can be transformed into visual context, and offering new possibilities for enhancing our understanding of environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The word "accurate" in that headline is doing a LOT of work.Here's how the results were scored:"Computer evaluations compared the relative proportions of greenery, building and sky between source and generated images, whereas human judges were asked to correctly match one of three generated images to an audio sample."So this is very impressive and a cool piece of research, but unsurprisingly not recreating the space "accurately" if you assume that means anything more than "has the right amount of sky and buildings and greenery".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is not my area of expertise, but if I understand the article correctly, they created a model that matches pre-existing audio clips to pre-existing images. But instead of returning the matching image, the LLM generates a distorted fake image which is vaguely similar to the real image.So it doesn't really, as the title claims, turn recordings into images (it already has the images) and the distorted fake images it creates are only "accurate" in that they broadly slot into the right category in terms of urban/rural setting, amount of greenery and amount of sky shown.It sounds like the matching is the useful part and the "generative" part is just a huge disadvantage. The paper doesn't seem to say if the LLM is any better than other types of models at the matching part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably the thing you really want from an article with this topic focus is to be able to see the images bigger then a postage stamp size. And, even more irritating - the images are actually there, in reasonable size, just not linked...https://news.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AI-street...

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges posed by facial recognition technology and explores how individuals might alter their appearance to evade detection. It emphasizes that even minor changes—such as hairstyle, makeup, or glasses—can significantly impact recognition accuracy. The piece also highlights the ethical implications of facial recognition and the consequences of identity alteration, suggesting a balance between personal privacy and technological advancement. The discussion integrates insights from experts on the effectiveness of facial disguise tactics in the context of pervasive surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a similar thought last time I was in an airport for an international flight and instead of scanning my boarding pass and looking at my passport they just let everyone walk through and as you passed the door it would tell you your seat number.When I was in Mexico I filed a report with the airport after an employee selling timeshares was overly aggressive and grabbed my arm and try to block me from leaving.  Quickly they showed me a video of my entire time with all my movements at the airport so they could pinpoint the employee.Like the article says I think it is just a matter of time until such systems are everywhere. We are already getting normalized to it at public transportation hubs with almost 0 objections. Soon most municipalities or even private businesses will implement it and no one will care because it already happens to them at the airport, so why make a fuss about it at the grocery store or on a public sidewalk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their conclusion reminds me of this lady in China, Lao Rongzhi, who was a serial killer along with her lover, Fa Ziying [0]. They both went around the country extorting and killing people, and, while Fa was arrested in 1999 via a police standoff, Lao was on the run for two decades, having had plastic surgery to change her face enough that most humans wouldn't have recognized her.But in those two decades, the state of facial recognition software had rapidly increased and she was recognized by a camera at a mall and matched to a national database of known criminals. At first police thought it were an error but after taking DNA evidence, it was confirmed to be the same person, and she was summarily executed.In this day and age, I don't think anyone can truly hide from facial recognition.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7D3mOHsVhg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If what you’re trying to do is to publish prepared images of yourself, that won’t be facially recognized as you, then the answer is “not very much at all actually” — see https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/. Adversarially prepared images can still look entirely like you, with all the facial-recognition-busting data being encoded at an almost-steganographic level vs our regular human perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42357372</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository "mise" by jdx is a lightweight library designed for managing and composing interfaces using a declarative syntax. It facilitates the creation of user interfaces by providing a simple, flexible, and efficient way to define component behavior and layout. The library emphasizes ease of use and integrates seamlessly with existing projects, making it suitable for developers looking to enhance their front-end development workflow. Additionally, the repository includes documentation and examples to help users get started quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started using mise back when it was still called rtx. I was a little annoyed by asdf's quirks and having it replicate that behavior while being faster and less intrusive in my shell configuration was great.Since then, mise has folded in two capabilities that I needed the most: Task Running and Env Vars.Overall, it has been a fantastic experience for me. I love how the developer has spent a lot of time ensuring compatibility with existing tools while still building future capabilities.I will add one thing that I knew I needed but couldn't find anywhere was added through the recent backends feature. I do a lot of trust and R development and there are dev tools that I need installed that I don't use as libraries, just the binaries. It was a problem making sure that those dependencies were installed in a new environment. Now, it's just so easy: I list those in my `mise.toml` file, and that ensures they are installed and installable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently switched to Mise for all of my JS, ruby, python, and java sdk management needs, and I’ve been delighted with it so far. Not having to install RVM, NVM, some toxic brew of python installers until I get a working python environment, and SDKMan has been such a breath of fresh air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm using it to unify my teams toolchain without resorting to nix or running everything in docker.I still use docker to run services and I still like the idea of nix, but the DX of mise is too good. Tasks are really nice too, all my repo scripts now have completions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42347917</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the latest developments regarding the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris following the devastating fire in 2019. It highlights the completion of the iconic spire's reconstruction, which is set to reopen to the public in 2024. The piece also touches on the efforts to restore the cathedral’s art and architecture, as well as the fundraising initiatives that have supported the restoration project. The overall focus is on the progress made and the anticipated return of the cathedral as a cultural landmark.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a beauty!  Its been rebuilt (restored is a tricky concept here) in largely the same materials and in the same form as the original, prior to various restoration efforts through the centuries, with a few knobs on.This means that we get a mediaeval cathedral looking like it did when it was conceived and built (with an extra spire and a few other things).  The colours are amazing.Elderly churches, mosques and temples (int al) have a habit of losing their original colours and "feel" across the centuries.  They change - age.  Stone walls age and thanks to modern pollution darken.  Pigments age, disperse and peel off.Notre Dame has been restored.  Not to how it was in 2018, prior the fire ... but to how it was intended when built, with a bit of sympathetic interpretation.Well done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the most spiritual moments of my life was entering Notre Dame, and I was not expecting it at all, wasn't really excited to go there, and am not really religious. Honestly I expected Stonehenge to be more impactful but Notre Dame is a way more worthy visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm french. Live in Paris. I do not understand the excitement the world has for Notre Dame. 
Question for you, reader: what does the fire and/or the rebuild means to you?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is anyone here using YugabyteDB for high-availability Postgres?It seems like a compelling option:* Much closer to Postgres compatibility than CockroachDB.* A more permissive license.* Built-in connection manager [1], which should simplify deployment.* Supports both high availability and geo-distribution, which is useful if scaling globally becomes necessary later.That said, I don't see it mentioned around here often. I wonder if anyone here has tried it and can comment on it.--1: https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/going-beyond-sql/c...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way I have found is to setup keepalived -&gt; pgbouncer -&gt; Postgres. Use repmgr to manage replication and barman for backups. Setup a VIP with keepalived with a small script that checks if the server is primary. You loose about 7-9 pings during a failover, have keepalived check about every 2 seconds and flip after 3 consecutive failures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven't used it yet.  But seeing as both Yugabyte and Cockroach being mentioned...pgEdge: https://github.com/pgedge/pgedge

Also includes integrations for several "home control" systems and a http API for programmatic control from another system.  Can even synchronize plural controllers into a whole 'net' (note, I've not used this feature yet).Small ESP32 boards (with wifi capability) such as this example (no affiliation, just an example that works):https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y8X1GK7WS2811 LED strings [1] (of which there are an infinite variety) suitable for outdoor use.

Having a soldering iron is helpful here, although one could possibly get by with screw terminal blocks inside weatherproof boxes if need be for many of the 'connections'.[1] Or other 'programmable LED' strings for which WLED is compatible (it works with numerous different programmable LED standards, browse the WLED website for details).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a tangent, but I feel like we can't talk about LED christmas lights without linking to this video by tech connections: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBFPJ3_6ZWsthe tl;dw is that most color LED lights work by emitting a single frequency of light. Compared to classic christmas lights, which are incandescent filaments filtered through dyed glass, the LED lights look a bit... radioactive.My personal pet peeve are white LED lights. If you're not careful to buy the ones labeled "warm" they look cold, and imo, not very festive and inviting.Of course, this is all a matter of taste, but once I became privy to the difference, I could no longer ignore it. I guess I'm just a millennial nostalgic for the lights of my youth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been super impressed so far with the Govee lights I’ve gotten. The app is pretty easy to use has tons of cool effects, and they have a LAN API (https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide) for most of their lights that have WiFi. Don’t have enough time this year to program a custom show but was going to start earlier next year now that I have a couple of these.
The new scene stage thing they just released where you can map your lights and have them all work together is pretty slick too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42341809</guid></item><item><title>14.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I watch this project since a few years and they make good progress. To whoever is interested in open source Computer Algebra Systems, there are of course plenty of more mature solutions. Classical ones such as GNU Octave or Maxima but also "modern ones" such as SAGEmath, Symbolics.jl or sympy. In particular, there is a broad range from symbolic libraries such as GiNaC up to "battery included" IDEs like SAGEmath. The community is vivid and amazing, for instance SAGEmath basically pioneered the web notebook interface which today brought us Jupyter in all its fashions.I personally love the LISPy style of Mathematica (MMA) but of course it is not the (only) the core which makes MMA so powerful but the super large library which has not only instance industry-leading solutions for basic topics such as symbolic integration, 2D/3D graphics or finite element methods but also a plethora of special purpose domains such as bioinformatics. I guess Mathics has a good clone of the core but lacks, of course, all the libraries. It is, by the way, the same logic as with Matlab and its many "toolkits" compared to the numpy clone. However, the python movement brought many novel codes into the numpy world which no more work on Matlab.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems to be based on sympy: https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you only want individual use, Wolfram Cloud is free to use. I think files delete after 30 days or something. Also the Wolfram Engine is a free way to use Mathematica via command line. Hey, its something...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42349375</guid></item><item><title>16.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post has left me wondering: what is zizmor? What is ultralytics? Are these words actually real or is someone having a stroke?Not all nerds know all projects so I decided to educate myself and followed OP’s links to learn about Ultralytics:&gt; Ultralytics YOLO11 is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility.Ultralytics’ readme doesn’t explain what ultralytics is or does. Thankfully Zizmor’s readme describes itself clearly:&gt; zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions. It can find many common security issues in typical GitHub Actions CI/CD setups.This isn’t a critique on OP: I enjoyed reading about the vulnerability(ies!) you found and I learned a lot. I’m just generally frustrated that so many readme files on GitHub fail to describe what the project actually does, Ultralytics being just one example.Have fun and keep hacking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why has CI for open-source projects become so difficult to secure? Where did we, collectively, go wrong?I suppose, it's probably some combination of: CI is configured in-band in the repo, PRs are potentially untrusted, CI uses the latest state of config on a potentially untrusted branch, we still want CI on untrusted branches, CI needs to run arbitrary code, CI has access to secrets and privileged operations.Maybe it's too many degrees-of-freedom creating too much surface area. Maybe we could get by with a much more limited subset, at least by default.I've been doing CI stuff in my last two day jobs. In contrast, we worked only on private repos with private collaborators, and we explicitly designated CI as trusted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Author of this post.)If you’re interested in how this went down, the timeline section[1] in particular is worth jumping to: my key takeaway is that this vulnerability was reintroduced, and that there’s only limited evidence that the Ultralytics team have done a full revocation and rotation of all accounts and credentials that the attacker may have had access to.Given that, it’s not inconceivable that a third round of backdoored packages will occur. I would recommend that people exercise extreme caution when installing the current versions; most users would probably be best served by pinning to an older version from before any indicators of compromise.[1]: https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/12/06/zizmor-ultralytics-inj...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42356345</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the repair of a high-end Tom Evans pre-amplifier, specifically focusing on a model that costs around $25,000. It details the challenges faced during the repair process, including specific technical issues and component failures. Additionally, the piece addresses a copyright strike that occurred in relation to sharing information about the repair, highlighting the tensions between technical communities and copyright enforcement in the context of sharing knowledge and experiences concerning expensive audio equipment. The article underscores the importance of DIY repair culture while navigating legal hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The word "copyright" is slowly transforming into a more generic meaning where a big company silences a little company/individual that it doesn't like. This case doesn't seem to have anything to do with actual copyright. Did the company specify exactly what content they believed was copied?If you have a kid under 20, ask them what "copyright" means. They'll probably describe it to you in terms of corporate bullying rather than anything that has to do with intellectual property or copying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to read the "earlier coverage" link for this to make sense. For starters, "Tom Evans" is the manufacturing company, not necessarily just a random dude. But I guess Mend it Mark embarrassed the hell out of this company, so they're lashing out in the finest corporate-approved tradition for YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video in question can still be viewed on the Internet archivehttps://archive.org/details/the-gbp-25-000-pre-amp-that-went...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42357115</guid></item><item><title>18.

&lt;p&gt;Qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused web browser that aims to provide a minimalistic and highly customizable browsing experience. It employs a Vim-like interface for efficient navigation and commands, allowing users to control the browser primarily through the keyboard. The project is open-source, built using Python and PyQt, and is designed to work on various platforms. Key features include a tabbed interface, support for multiple web standards, privacy-oriented functionality, and an extensive configuration system that allows users to tailor the browser to their preferences. The project encourages contributions and offers comprehensive documentation for users and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Florian Bruhin (AKA the-compiler, the author of qutebrowser) is one of the kindest and most dedicated open-source maintainers I've ever had the pleasure to interact with.I've used qutebrowser extensively in the past, and reported a few bugs, each of which has been met with interest and engagement. Some of them even uncovered bugs in the upstream software (e.g. QtWebEngine) which were reported there.I eventually stopped using it when YouTube ads became too invasive, and went back to Firefox + Vimium + uBlockOrigin. I sometimes miss the programmibility of qutebrowser, but Vimium at least gives me the basic Vim-like browsing features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone was triggered by the Nyxt post getting so much attention... =DI like Qutebrowser very much, though. Used it for a good spell and was very happy. I'd some bug I couldn't fix which was driving everything really bonkers, but I honestly did not investigate it that hard, I'd been using it for a while at that stage (over a year, I'd guess, anyway) and was ready to move on and try something different, so I solved that bug the old fashioned way.Nyxt scratches the same itch now, but moreso, and it has Common Lisp behind it, which is much more interesting [to me personally!] than Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried an extension once that provided these navigation shortcuts for all the links on a page. It was really convenient but then I was on an admin page for our team and accidentally hit a couple keys that pressed some random button. The page was full of buttons that had irreversible effects which were executed without confirmation. Of course that’s an issue itself for the page but that’s kept me from trying this again.The convenience those shortcuts provide also makes it concerningly easy to press something on accident. Much more likely than accidentally clicking something. Having extra leader keys or some other approach to reduce accidental presses would detract from the convenience…Curious if anyone else has run into this or configured their setup in a way that maintains the convenience but reduces the accident likeliness. Holding a modifier key or adding leader keys actually does seem like I’d go a long way in reducing accidents with minimal hit to effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42356668</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a study indicating that browsing negative content online exacerbates mental health struggles, particularly for individuals already experiencing anxiety and depression. Researchers found that frequent exposure to distressing online material can lead to increased feelings of hopelessness and diminished well-being. The study emphasizes the importance of being mindful of the content consumed online and suggests that limiting exposure to negative information could be beneficial for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

Things that I have no control over. Don’t get me wrong it’s good to be informed about these things but constant influx of such information is not helping anyone. It’s critical to regulate what we consume on web because our brains have a tendency to think about what we consume. Our thoughts get influenced by what information we are consuming. Seriously ditch the feed that someone else is curating for you!RSS is all you need  https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/why-rss/P.S. I haven't been able to ditch hacker news like I wanted to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hnews is the only thing I read lately.I had to remove reddit, CNN, nytimes, fnews, fb. And honestly I'm a lot happier.I'm sad because I no longer an doing my civic duty to stay informed and have an educated opinion but part of gaining that opinion I would get materially angry at the otherside that they were "being so stupid, obviously you shouldn't think like that".It got bad enough it was affecting me personally and how I interacted with my family.I'll start up again eventually because it matters to me but for now I need to stay happier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything is designed to invoke negative emotions because negative emotions are engaging and engagement is money.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recently coded a linear-probing hash map in C and I highly recommend you to use fuzz tests. These evolve naturally from unit tests: next step table unit tests, next step property test, next step fuzzing, all steps are incremental, hence easy.Having a fuzz test was in-va-lu-ab-le. I caught several bugs right there. The delete function was particularly tricky.I ended up with two fuzz tests as my hash table has a key feature: convergence. Having same contents, it would have exactly same bits in the buffer. In other words, it is independent of the insertion/deletion order. For this, I added another fuzz test. I would add a third one if I  realize there is an important invariant I did not fuzz test. That is not much work, but so much useful!https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/abc/fuzz/HASH....https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/abc/fuzz/HASHd...P.S. In your case, I recommend clang's libfuzzer with ASAN.https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#fuzzer-usage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bug, I believe: If you "put" three colliding strings A and then B and then C, and then "delete" B, you won't be able to find C anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for sharing. Simplicity is a good thing.In order to speed it up by reducing the number of malloc() calls, it may be worth adding a simple arena memory allocation measure: by allocating one larger block (e.g. 1 MB) initially and then doubling the memory size each time you run out, all malloc()/calloc() calls can become local salmagundi_alloc() calls that are just macro invocations that return an arena buffer pointer and also increment said pointer as a side effect.I also recommend you have a look at Chris Hanson's book "C: Interfaces and Implementations", which has a few neat C API tricks that your code could benefit from (e.g. for reducing name space pollution, for avoiding null pointer argument errors, API method naming etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42359949</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The document provides the header file `os.h`, which is part of the SQLite database engine source code. It defines various types, macros, and function prototypes related to file and operating system interface operations within SQLite. The header includes definitions for file handling, threading, and other system-level functionalities that SQLite relies on to interact with the underlying operating system, enabling it to perform tasks such as file I/O and managing database connections across different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relevant comment here:
https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/e8346d0a889c89ec8a78e6...2006-10-31:  The default prefix used to be "sqlite_".  But then Mcafee started using SQLite in their anti-virus product and it started putting files with the "sqlite" name in the c:/temp folder.
This annoyed many windows users.  Those users would then do a Google search for "sqlite", find the telephone numbers of the developers and call to wake them up at night and complain. 
For this reason, the default name prefix is changed to be "sqlite" spelled backwards.  So the temp files are still identified, but anybody smart enough to figure out the code is also likely smart enough to know that calling the developer will not help get rid of the file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Similar to how Daniel Stenberg (`curl` author) gets complain e-mails unrelated to `curl`, because his address end up being in the license or credits screen of plenty of software.&gt; Apparently, people often have problems finding an appropriate address to contact when they have issues with this app.&gt; This leads a disproportionate amount of them to send emails to me asking for solutions and fixes to their situations.— https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/12/03/no-need-to-email-me-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQLite's temp file prefix was originally "sqlite_" until McAfee's antivirus started creating temp files in Windows' `c:/temp` folder, frustrating users who then tracked down and called SQLite developers to complain. In response, the prefix was changed to "etilqs_" (SQLite reversed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358470</guid></item><item><title>23.

Back in 2018, I discovered a flaw in a website enabling anyone to track any US cellphone’s location without consent, and I contacted US-CERT and Krebs to break the news (https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsm...). After checking the locations of several numbers he provided, I remember discussing his need for location privacy - and his shock when he found it was so easy to break. His opsec might be very strict, but when every cellular carrier is eager to sell off your location data, that level of security is absolutely justified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worked with a guy a few years ago, a React dev, who would do this in serious meetings. A bunch of us would find it pretty amusing. It was like that scene from Supertroopers. His Slack avatar was also Nyan Cat.&gt;One hint some of the accounts belonged to Waifu: He liked to use animated cats as avatars. Other aliases included Meowist, Catist and Scarlet the Meow Cat, according to court filings. “He would say meow all the time.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As programmers we are ingrained to look further than the problem at hand. We try to see the bigger picture, solve problems in holistic ways if possible.Often this can lead to over-engineering, creating more corner cases and ambiguity in requirements and reduction of test coverage. That is a trap to lok out for.On the other hand it also can lead to better understanding of the problem space, increase understandability, and less need for later refactoring.Just stating, 'don't look further than the problem you are required to solve' is not an excellent general rule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The list of rules covered can be found in the book description on the purchase links, like: https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-rules-of-programming-how-to...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an ad for a book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42360008</guid></item><item><title>25.

I'll take being human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That second video with the snorkelers sidling up to the orcas while they're attacking/feeding -- I know orcas have no record of attacking humans, but that's just a no^100 for me. Who's to say they won't get a little rambunctious in their glee at feeding and use one of the swimmers as a chew toy? Or decide that we might taste funny, but would make an interesting palette cleanser? In some parts of Africa, lions don't usually target humans, but you don't see researchers walking up to lions taking out a zebra like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any definitive reasons as to why killer whales haven’t targeted humans?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273193</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of discontinuous derivatives, focusing on how certain functions can exhibit derivatives that are not continuous everywhere. It provides examples of functions that demonstrate this behavior, delving into the mathematical implications and properties of such derivatives. The author explains the conditions under which a derivative can be discontinuous and highlights the importance of understanding these concepts in the broader context of calculus and mathematical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really appreciated this piece. Thank you to OP for writing and submitting it.The thing that piqued my interest was the side remark that the Dirac delta is a “distribution“, and that this is an unfortunate name clash with the same concept in probability (measure theory).My training (in EE) used both Dirac delta “functions” (in signal processing) and distributions in the sense of measure theory (in estimation theory). Really two separate forks of coursework.I had always thought that the use of delta functions in convolution integrals (signal processing) was ultimately justified by measure theory — the same machinery as I learned (with some effort) when I took measure theoretic probability.But, as flagged by the OP, that is not the case! Mind blown.Some of this is the result of the way these concepts are taught. There is some hand waving both in signal processing, and in estimation theory, when these difficult functions and integrals come up.I’m not aware of signal processing courses (probably graduate level) in which convolution against delta “functions” uses the distribution concept. There are indeed words to the effect of either,- Dirac delta is not a function, but think of it as a limit of increasingly-concentrated Gaussians;- use of Dirac delta is ok, because we don’t need to represent it directly, only the result of an inner product against a smooth function (i.e., a convolution)But these excuses are not rigorously justified, even at the graduate level, in my experience.*Separately from that, I wonder if OP has ever seen the book Radically Elementary Probability Theory, by Edward Nelson (https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/rept.pdf). It uses nonstandard analysis to get around a lot of the (elegant) fussiness of measure theory.The preface alone is fun to read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differentiation turns out to be a deeper subject than most people expect even if you just stick to the ordinary real numbers rather than venturing into things like hyperreals.I once saw in an elementary calculus book a note after the proof of a theorem about differentiation that the converse of the theorem was also true but needed more advanced techniques than were covered in the book.I checked the advanced calculus and real analysis books I had and they didn't have the proof.I then did some searching and found mention of a book titled "Differentiation" (or something similar) and found a site that had scans for the first chapter of that book. It proved the theorem on something like page 6 and I couldn't understand it at all. Starting from the beginning I think I got through maybe a page or two before it got to my deep with my mere bachelor's degree in mathematics level of preparation.I kind of wish I'd bought a copy of that book. I've never since been able to find it. I've found other books with the same or similar title but they weren't it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One minor nit: A function can be differentiable at a and discontinuous at a even with the standard definition of the derivative. A trivial example would be the function f(x) = (x²-1)/(x-1) which is undefined at x=1, but f'(1)=1 (in fact derivatives have exactly this sort of discontinuity in them which is why they’re defined via limits). In complex analysis, this sort of “hole” in the function is called a removable singularity¹ which is one of three types of singularities that show up in complex functions.⸻1. Yes, this is mathematically the reason why black holes are referred to as singularities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312376</guid></item><item><title>27. 1,600 days of a failed hobby data science project</title><link>https://lellep.xyz/blog/failed-data-science-project.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the common pitfalls and reasons behind failed data science projects, emphasizing the importance of clear objectives, proper data management, and collaboration among team members. It outlines specific factors that contribute to project failures, such as inadequate project scope, lack of domain knowledge, and insufficient stakeholder engagement. The author encourages teams to adopt a more structured approach by prioritizing communication, continuous learning, and iterating on the project based on feedback to enhance the chances of success in data science initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some very weird things in this.1. The title makes it sound like the author spent a lot of time on this project. But really, this mostly consisted of noting down a couple of URLs per day. So maybe 5 min / day = ~130h spent on the project. Let's say 200h to be on the safe side.2. "Get first analyses results out quickly based on a small dataset and don’t just collect data up front to “analyse it later”" =&gt; I think this actually killed the project. Collecting data for several years w/o actually doing anything doesn't with it is not a sound project.3. "If I would have finished the project, this dataset would then have been released"  ==&gt; There is literally nothing stopping OP from still doing this. It costs maybe 2h of work and would potentially give a substantial benefit to others, i.e., turn this project into a win after all. I'm very puzzled why OP didn't do this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People relatively new to CS would be wise to be warned about what a colossal time sink it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure I would call this a failure.. more just something you tried out of curiosity and abandoned. Happens to literally everyone. “Failed” to me would imply there was something fundamentally broken about the approach or the dataset, or that there was an actual negative impact to the unrealized result. It’s very hard to finish long-running side projects that aren’t generating income, attention, or driven by some quasi-pathological obsession. The fact you even blogged about it and made HN front page qualifies as a success in my book.&gt; If I would have finished the project, this dataset would then have been released and used for a number of analyses using Python.Nothing stopping you from releasing the raw dataset and calling it a success!&gt; Back then, I would have trained a specialised model (or used a pretrained specialised model) but since LLMs made so much progress during the runtime of this project from 2020-Q1 to 2024-Q4, I would now rather consider a foundational model wrapped as an AI agent instead; for example, I would try to find a foundation model to do the job of for example finding the right link on the Tagesschau website, which was by far the most draining part of the whole project.I actually just started (and subsequently —-abandoned—- paused) my own news analysis side project leveraging LLMs for consolidation/aggregation.. and yeah, the web scraping part is still the worst. And I’ve had the same thought that feeding raw HTML to the LLM might be an easier way of parsing web objects now. The problem is most sites are privy to scraping efforts and it’s not so much a matter of finding the right element but bypassing the weird click-thru screens, tricking the site that you’re on a real browser, etc…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42360685</guid></item><item><title>28.

But this time I was scrolling the picture on an iPad and the next one was coming up and it was directly in focus and the next one too.This was real incredible - no need to focus again - it is like living in this hidden world.If you never experienced this I recommend to try it - at least for me it was a wow moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have stereograms advanced in some way over the past 30 years? I know how silly that sounds, but: I remember back in the day when the fad first broke, spending minutes, many minutes, trying "get" it. And having to focus (heh) on focusing my eyes. And sometimes failing. I haven't looked at a stereogram since then until now.And these were easy. The first one literally took 15 seconds to "drop in." The second maybe ten. The third was near-instant. The only one that gave me any trouble was the continuous function one like an egg crate, with no sharp edges, just dropping down and up. That took maybe twenty seconds, and once I recognized what I was looking for, it was easy.So has the technique changed/improved? Or has my brain changed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42321163</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the importance of mastering foundational concepts in mathematics before progressing to higher levels of abstraction. It emphasizes that gaining a deep understanding through concrete examples and hands-on practice is crucial for building a solid mathematical foundation. The author argues that skipping this essential groundwork can lead to misconceptions and difficulties in more advanced topics, ultimately hindering a student's ability to grasp complex ideas. The piece advocates for a balanced approach to learning, integrating both concrete experiences and abstract thinking in mathematical education.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; What a lot of math learners fail to understand is that grinding through concrete examples imbues you with intuition that you will not get if you jump directly to studying the most abstract ideas.I feel that's more a lesson for a lot of math teachers to understand. I remember some frustrating linear algebra, calculus and computational complexity courses where the lector basically threw some formulas onto the blackboard, went line-by-line through a formal proof of their correctness and then called it a day. Giving actual examples of the application of the formula was an afterthought left to the student aides. Giving examples that could explain the derivation of the formula was not even considered as an idea.It always reminded me of someone teaching an "introduction to vi" course but then just scrolling through vi's source code without any further explanation - and in the end expecting the students to be able to fluently use vi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's the same principle which makes it wise to first do some copy pasting before you abstract stuff into a common library. Gathering some (more than two) concrete use cases before you factor out the common functionality makes much better library functions.A common sign of prematurely deduplicated code is a common function with lots of boolean flags and other knobs to tweak its behaviour for every use case added after it was written.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is presumably about math problems, but I always approach programming problems this way.One issue I have with math problems is that sometimes I wish I could immediately go down one level of abstraction and see something like a physics or programming problem that applies that specific or related problem I'm working on. I haven't found a resource like this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42357669</guid></item><item><title>31.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that Ted Nelson's visionary Xanadu project had actually addressed this issue decades ago. In the original design of Project Xanadu, rule 9 states "Every document can contain a royalty mechanism at any desired degree of granularity to ensure payment on any portion accessed, including virtual copies ('transclusions') of all or part of the document." This suggests a foresighted approach to content monetisation which the modern web, in many ways an unfinished hypertext prototype, still lacks. Nelson's idea was to embed financial transactions directly into the fabric of document interchange, an integration not yet realised in today's digital content landscape.See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rul...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the one thing that I actually thought cryptocurrency would help - getting small adhoc payments out from under the bootheel of Mastercard and Visa, and especially for international transfers that cross between, say, the MC/Visa duopoly regions into other ones like the Asian ecosystems.But instead it's slow, inconsistent, inconvenient, balkanised, dripping with scams, criminals and bad actors and still involves substantial transfer fees and volatility on top of that. At this point it's a market for lemons: any new cryptocurrency venture is almost entirely indistinguishable from something that already ended up being at best a non-starter, but often just a scam.As a vehicle for speculation, arbitrage and scams, it's a masterpiece. As a currency (you know, like in the name), it's, put lightly, not great, especially if you live in the developed world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; I have money and I have a URL, how do I send money to the publisher of that URL?This question could easily be “I have money and I have a person’s name and address, how do I send money to them?”The only way to do this consistently would be to mail them physical cash, since there’s no way to consistently send money electronically across the world (and you’d have a currency conversion problem too - if someone mailed me US$0.23, it’s not worth exchanging it).Building micropayments infrastructure requires building broader financial infrastructure, not just adding a meta tag. This can use existing infrastructure to some extent, but it’s a pretty big challenge.(For example, in Australia, you can send someone money if you have their email address (via PayID), so you could bootstrap that part - minus the international part.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299089</guid></item><item><title>32.

Like any tech company these days, they're trying to jump on the AI bandwagon, but that hasn't actually changed what markets they're operating in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI chip or even networking chip maker is somewhat incorrect. Marvell makes every kind of chip, will design you a chip, sell you IP, whatever you want.They started with disk drive controllers, recently they’ve made a decent NVME controller. They bought global foundries custom asic devision in 2019 and that’s when they really got into the custom chip business (according to wikipedia).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Murphy, who has served as chief executive officer of Marvell Technology since 2016, has been among the few names floated as potential replacements for the recently ousted Pat Gelsinger at Intel’s corner office.As an aside, it's funny to read "Intel's corner office".

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the life and mysterious disappearance of Arthur Cravan, a Dadaist poet and avant-garde artist known for his provocative performances and eccentric personality. Cravan, who was also the nephew of Oscar Wilde, challenged societal norms and artistic conventions in the early 20th century. His disappearance in 1918 while attempting to sail to Mexico remains unexplained, adding to his enigmatic legacy. The piece examines his contributions to the Dada movement and the impact of his rebellious spirit on modern art and literature, while also delving into the theories surrounding his fate after vanishing at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

It highlights the tensions between various factions, including the Syrian military and opposition forces, particularly in areas like Sweida, Daraa, and Homs.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses China's initiative to combat desertification in the Taklamakan Desert by building a "green wall" through extensive afforestation efforts. The project aims to restore ecosystems, improve local agriculture, and mitigate the effects of sandstorms. It highlights the importance of sustainable practices, community involvement, and the challenges posed by climate change and arid conditions. The green wall is seen as a crucial step towards environmental preservation and enhancing the resilience of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It took 46 years to create the 1,900 mile, ~3060 km green belt around the 130,350 square miles (337,600 km2) desert. The linked article doesn't say anything about negatives, but the positives seem to be very beneficial for the area.I really wish other major powers would commit to similar projects. In my opinion, communities need larger goals to strive towards, to provide a sense of continued belonging and reinvestment for the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder whether this is working, as far as preventing desertification goes. The project has critics. It might just the state declaring victory?Edit: apparently it’s controversial.Will China’s “green Great Wall” save it from encroaching sands?https://www.economist.com/china/2024/12/05/will-chinas-green...https://archive.is/FVimm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ”The initiative combines solar-powered sand-blocking technology with extensive vegetation planting to stabilize the desert’s edges.”What sand-blocking tech is that?

We've seen in more "media-literate" countries a free-floating distrust of media of all kinds that is exacerbated by the keener awareness of deceptive techniques. Niklas Luhmann has written about this "suspicion of manipulation:" https://monoskop.org/images/6/6c/Luhmann_Niklas_The_Reality_...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would say creating sexual, pornographic or depicting criminal acts with AI generated images and videos using photographs and media of a person without their consent is morally wrong. It will however, only get easier to create and manipulate images. It is going to become automatic and the barriers to entry will be reduced. The social default will be to assume that everything is a AI generated or manipulated. It will not matter if the content is real.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the main fact of this story (that deepfakes were created) is true, the article overall seems like a propaganda piece by a highly unpopular government to create a soft image.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the FDA's role in regulating health practices and pharmaceuticals in the United States, highlighting perceived conflicts between the agency’s regulations and the principles of individual health freedom. It criticizes the FDA for prioritizing corporate interests over public health, arguing that these regulations can limit access to alternative treatments and therapies. The piece emphasizes the need for a more patient-centered approach to healthcare regulation, advocating for less restrictive policies that empower individuals to make informed health choices.&lt;/p&gt;

The story of the fight which has been waged for the protection of the public against adulterated and unfit foodstuffs is not a pleasant one. Politics has often played a larger part than a consideration of the welfare of the public. While some adulterations have only a commercial and not a public health interest, none the less the people should be protected against them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What some people think the FDA is doing:   Suppressing natural therapies
   Protecting the pharma industry

What the FDA is actually doing:   Preventing hustlers from peddling false hope (at best ineffective, at worst harmful) to less educated people in dire straits

The hypothetical alternate regulatory reality isn't 'Some good stuff that the FDA blocked is made available.'It's 'Fly by night companies are able to push bullshit onto unsuspecting consumers... again.'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it there but I am missing it?

Thompson himself had a compensation package worth $10.2 million[0] a year. It's reasonable to think that other c-suiters at the company, along with those of its parent organization, made similar amounts of money.The company also has a 1.53% dividend yield[1].The average American's lifetime earnings are $1.8 million for men, and $1.1 million for women[2]. That is to say, within five years, Mr. Thompson would likely have made ten times the average American's lifetime economic output, post-tax.If you're paying a significant chunk of your yearly earnings to be covered by UNH, you expect the money you paid to go towards providing you with service. Instead, tens of millions of it goes towards a handful of individuals, and regardless of how the company does financially, participants in the equities market will get some of your money, and you'll possibly be denied the service you paid for in order to make that happen.People will say that this is necessary to remain competitive, but it just isn't. People with severe health problems or loved ones with severe health problems aren't asking these executives or shareholders to live like paupers; they just expect the service they paid for. When there's something as life-ruining as chronic health conditions dogging you every single day, there's a chance you snap, and in the US, there's fairly trivial access to tools to help you do that.[0] https://www.msn.com/en-in/health/health-news/the-salary-bonu...

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have four children. I have never regretted it or wished for a different path. I know it isn't for everyone, but it absolutely was and is for me.At the same time I do think articles like this should be countered with the reality that many fathers aren't overwhelmed with waves of love or "surreal magnificence". With each of my children being born the primary emotions I could point to were dread and anxiety.The sudden overwhelming obligation to provide care, comfort and security for such a vulnerable human for decades encompasses your being.One of the reasons birthrates have plummeted in the West, and sentiments about having children have dropped, is that we have no "village", so to speak. Having children is not only an astronomical expense -- every single element of life is dramatically more expensive, made much worse with the housing crisis occurring in many Western nations -- a couple is often entirely on their own. There are no respites or breaks.And as children get viewed as a selfish luxury, the social norms for what a parent needs to do to be proper climb ever higher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it like this for everyone? I sometimes wonder how large the number of cases is where the parent does not feel like that at all but refrains from sharing it due to societal expectations and fear of being judged. It would introduce a bias regarding these stories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still feel that way. My kids are well into their third decades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42357041</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses recent developments in Linux's handling of EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) and the integration of Zboot, which allows for booting Linux kernels that are compressed with Gzip or Zstandard (Zstd). It highlights how these changes enhance the boot process efficiency and user experience, benefiting both developers and end-users. The article emphasizes the importance of these updates for systems that rely on EFI, as well as the potential performance improvements associated with using Zstd for kernel compression.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t have a horse in this race, but if only Zstd were left I would feel like even more simplification was accomplished.Everybody has their own tiny preference for one of the other but really… if it’s not embedded what is the impact?&gt; - GZIP is tried and tested, and is still one of the fastest at decompression time, although the compression ratio is not very high; moreover, Fedora is already shipping EFI zboot kernels for arm64 that use GZIP, and QEMU implements direct support for it when booting a kernel without firmware loaded;&gt; - ZSTD has a very high compression ratio (although not the highest), and is almost as fast as GZIP at decompression time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; - ZSTD has a very high compression ratio (although not the highest), and is almost as fast as GZIP at decompression time.If you're using zstd and its decompression speed isn't at least twice as fast as gzip's, you're using it wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;why not keep lz4 as well, shouldn't it have the smallest performance hit compared to those two?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358701</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title is ambiguous. It might sound like it is about&gt; "GrapheneOS on Pixels" getting "extended Android support"But it is really about&gt; GrapheneOS (commenting) on "Pixels getting extended Android support"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s great that Google is extending the support, and that GrapheneOS can benefit from it.I bought a Pixel 4a specifically for installing GrapheneOS. I used it happily for almost 3 years, until EOL firmware support. The phone worked fine, but I wanted the reassurance of firmware security updates.I was going to get a Pixel 6/7 (I forget which was available at the time) to use GrapheneOS again, but I was so annoyed at Google for only supporting firmware for 3 years, that I decided to switch to an iPhone SE.Shortly after this, I believe the next Pixel came out with 5+ years support. I had some regret, but the iPhone SE is OK, and I didn’t want to buy a new phone just for the sake of it.I will probably switch back to GrapheneOS for my next phone, as it really is a great mobile OS. Hopefully the project is still going strong by then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42354056</guid></item><item><title>48.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of inventing "JSON with comments" format, why not simply use JSON5?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the needs for comments in JSON are well understood, little discussions were made about which comment syntax and semantics should be used. It is not even clear that implementations should return comments as a part of data model! Almost all JSON alternatives, which number at least hundreds I believe, are either unclear or haven't given much thought about this. And those who do care about them are unpopular. sighGiven its importance, we should take this into the standard body. Namely, the IETF should be pressurized enough to update RFC 8259 for every nitty-gritty about comments. It is clear that this new version of JSON needs to address multiple use cases which are often mutually exclusive, so we probably need to introduce some short indicator for profiles at the very beginning of the document. (Yes, that means you should declare in advance that you want comments and other humane syntaxes. I don't think that's very hard when you do want comments.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do people expect out of json comments? Should they be round trippable? Returned as part of data or out of band as extra metadata? Do we need to make them round trippable to old parsers that don't understand comments? So many interesting questions for one of the most used formats in the world!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42360390</guid></item><item><title>49.

That's a cost of $71K a school.It looks like Starlink is $17,000 for ten years of service, so even if you were to add a few thousand dollars for installation, there's a lot of overhead there.It does strike me that a top-down approach seems more costly than a model that allows schools to get grants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reads as extremely centralistic and patronizing. Just provide a web form where schools can apply for funds. Have a local representative visit them and describe the local situation to allow a small central team to allocate suitable funds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42304321</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the performance comparison between smartphones and PCs, highlighting advancements in mobile processing power that allow phones to handle tasks previously exclusive to computers. It explores the differences in architecture, functionality, and software capabilities, emphasizing that while phones are incredibly powerful and increasingly capable of performing complex tasks like gaming and multitasking, PCs still hold advantages in areas requiring extensive processing power and multitasking efficiency. The piece ultimately suggests that while smartphones are closing the gap, PCs remain essential for high-level productivity and specialized applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Edge [1] tried and failed to do this a decade ago, but today we have the Purism Librem 5 [2] which becomes a full Linux desktop when plugged into a monitor.[1]: https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-edge[2]: https://puri.sm/posts/a-librem-5-video-made-on-a-librem-5/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's funny, as my phone (A 2022 Moto Razr) can work as PC, if I plug it into a monitor with it's USB-C port. I can plug it into a monitor, and plug a mouse and keyboard into the monitor's inbuilt USB-C hub, and it works just fine. Has a desktop mode and everything! If the monitor doesn't have a hub in it, I can use the phone as a mouse/touchpad! Plus, if the monitor supports it, it'll even keep it charged rather than using the battery!And I don't just use it as a gimmick, I use a HDMI/USB-C cable to use it with my TV as a streaming/light gaming setup. Nice to be able to plug it in, kick off a streaming app or Youtube, or play some Minecraft or something on my TV in bed, all comfy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What astounds most ist that we have now ~16 years of Android and there is still no all around decent keyboard for power users. It seems like everybody has accepted to use Android just as a consumer OS.When I started using Unexpected Keyboard the realization that I can just shift + arrow select text and ctrl + x cut it hit me like a bag of bricks. This is such a simple thing, but the existing story for marking and editing text is so bad on phones that I nearly forgot that just making existing shortcuts available would already be a sifnificant improvement.Sadly unexpected keyboard has other flaws, like no prediction/correction, no swype and less typing accuracy since there are no statistics on where you hit buttons that could adjust the collision borders etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:11:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358388</guid></item><item><title>1.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Google’s development of the Willow quantum chip, which represents a significant advancement in quantum computing technology. It highlights the chip's capabilities, such as improved computational power and efficiency, as well as its potential applications in various fields, including optimization and materials science. The post emphasizes the importance of continued research and innovation in quantum computing to solve complex problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. Additionally, it outlines collaborations and future goals for expanding quantum research and development at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a quantum dabbler so I’ll throw out an armchair reaction: this is a significant announcement.My memory is that 256 bit keys in non quantum resistant algos need something like 2500 qubits or so; and by that I mean generally useful programmable qubits. To show a bit over 100 qubits with stability, meaning the information survives a while, long enough to be read, and general enough to run some benchmarks on is something many people thought might never come.There’s a sort of religious reaction people have to quantum computing: it breaks so many things that I think a lot of people just like to assume it won’t happen: too much in computing and data security will change -&gt; let’s not worry about it.Combined with the slow pace of physical research progress (Schorrs algorithm for quantum factoring was mid 90s), and snake oil sales companies, it’s easy to ignore.Anyway seems like the clock might be ticking; AI and data security will be unalterably different if so. Worth spending a little time doing some long tail strategizing I’d say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They opened the API for it and I'm sending requests but the response always comes back 300ms before I send the request, is there a way of handling that with try{} predestined{} blocks? Or do I need to use the Bootstrap Paradox library?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverseI see the evidence, and I see the conclusion, but there's a lot of ellipses between the evidence and the conclusion.Do quantum computing folks really think that we are borrowing capacity from other universes for these calculations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42367649</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a vulnerability in OpenWrt, a popular open-source firmware for routers, stemming from a potential exploit in its supply chain that involves a SHA-256 collision. It explains how an attacker can manipulate the firmware by creating a malicious version that appears legitimate, thereby compromising network security. The post details the technical aspects of the collision, the implications for users, and emphasizes the importance of security measures in open-source projects to protect against such supply chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A vulnerability not mentioned in the article is the normalisation of executing code that has been especially targeted to a specific user or specific device with no validation of reproducibility and no ability for anyone to verify this custom build and download service hasn't been generating backdoored builds.One should want to ensure use of the same build of xz-utils that Andres Freund is using, or at least a build of xz-utils that other security researchers can later obtain to figure out whether supply chain implants are present in open source software[1].There's a write up at Mozilla[2] from years ago describing an abandoned attempt by Mozilla to ensure their release builds are publicly logged in a Merkle tree. Google has written up their implementation for Pixel firmware builds but apps delivered through the Google Play Store seem to be vulnerable (unless there is another log I have been unable to find).[3] Apple is seemingly worse than Google on binary transparency with Apple's firmware and app distribution system targeting builds to individual devices with no transparency of builds.For an example of binary transparency done well, Gentoo's ebuild repository (being a single Git repository/Merkle tree containing source checksums) possibly remains the largest and most distributed Merkle trees of open source software.[1] Post xz-utils backdoor, some researchers (including some posting to oss-security about their efforts) undertook automated/semi-automated scans of open source software builds to check for unexplained high entropy files which could contain hidden malicious code. This is not possible to achieve with customised per-user/per-device builds unless every single build is made publicly available for later analysis and a public log (Merkle tree) accompanies those published builds.[2] https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Binary_Transparency[3] https://developers.google.com/android/binary_transparency/ov...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isn't the "".join also dangerous?    get_str_hash(
        "".join(
            [
                build_request.distro,
                build_request.version,

                build_request.target,
                ...

You can shift characters between adjacent fields without changing the hash. Maybe you cannot compromise the system directly, but you could poison the cache with a broken image, or induce a downgrade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's why open source can never compete with business grade closed source stuff:- they fixed the in 3 hours instead of making customers wait 6 months for a patch (if any)- they did not try to sue the reporter of the issue- they did not even tell the users to throw away the "outdated" but perfectly working devices, offering a small discount to buy new&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363102</guid></item><item><title>3.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every day that passes I grow fonder of Google's decision to delay or otherwise keep a lot of this under the wraps.The other day I was scrolling down on YouTube shorts and a couple videos invoked an uncanny valley response from me (I think it was a clip of an unrealistically large snake covering some hut) which was somehow fascinating and strange and captivating, and then scrolling down a few more, again I saw something kind of "unbelievable"... I saw a comment or two saying it's fake, and upon closer inspection: yeah, there were enough AI'esque artifacts that one could confidently conclude it's fake.We'd known about AI slop permeating Facebook -- usually a Jesus figure made out of unlikely set of things (like shrimp!) and we'd known that it grips eyeballs. And I don't even know in which box to categorize this, in my mind it conjures the image of those people on slot machines, mechanically and soullessly pulling levers because they are addicted. It's just so strange.I can imagine now some of the conversations that might have happened at Google when they choose to keep a lot of innovations related to genAI under the wraps (I'm being charitable here of their motives), and I can't help but agree.And I can't help but be saddened about OpenAI's decisions to unload a lot of this before recognizing the results of unleashing this to humanity, because I'm almost certain it'll be used more for bad things than good things, I'm certain its application on bad things will secure more eyeballs than on good things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've found using these and similar tools that the amount of prompts and iteration required to create my vision (image or video in my mind) is very large and often is not able to create what I had originally wanted. A way to test this is to take a piece of footage or an image which is the ground truth, and test how much prompting and editing it takes to get the same or similar ground truth starting from scratch. It is basically not possible with the current tech and finite amounts of time and iterations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not available in France yet, I'd we interested to know if it's a matter of progressive rollout, or some form of legislation (EU or otherwise ?) that's making OpenAI cautious ? Something like the EU AI Act [1] ?In a sane world, any video produced by Sora would be required to have a form of watermarking that's on par with what intellectual property owners require.We've put people in jail for sharing copyrighted movies, and don't see why we would refrain from mandating that AI generated videos have some caption that says, I don't know, "This video was generated with AI" ?People would not respect the mandate, and we would consider that illegal, and use the monopoly on force to take money out of their bank account.I know, it sounds mad and soooo 20th century - maybe that's why OpenAI overlords are not deeming peasants in France worthy of "a cat in a suit drinking coffee in an office" and "you'll never believe what the other candidate is doing to your kids".[1] https://www.imatag.com/blog/ai-act-legal-requirement-to-labe...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42368604</guid></item><item><title>4.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the one running itch.io, so here's some more context for you:From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing  Funko Pop video game (Funko Fusion), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game. The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this. Their website, if you care: https://www.brandshield.com/About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname). I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.I've been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to "escalate" the issue myself on social media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain"One registrar off the list of registrars you wanna use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A similar thing has happened to me before. There is a company with the same name as my surname with a trademark for it.When I registered a domain with my surname in it, the registrar had an automatic process in place that checked for this trademark and took away access of the domain. So far so good. The problem was that the registrar and its support then ghosted me and also never refunded me for the money already paid to lease the domain for a year. Overall it was a bad experienced with bad communication that made me switch registrar (note: this was a different registrar than mentioned here).I think one of the problems is that as more and more individual consumers buy domains, certain legal processes and automation are not ready for that. A good registrar should anticipate that an individual private consumer may not have the legal experience or knowledge to deal with just being hit with something they were never explicitly warned of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363727</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally, I think this is a dead-end business decision. I've seen this gamebook play out over and over. It rarely ends well.The problem is that in 2024, kids can play video games and watch stupid videos in the comfort of their own home. Perhaps screens beat animatronics, ball pits, and whatnot, but there's no competitive advantage over superior alternatives in the new space.Examples:- Book stores. Cut costs to compete with online sellers. Move more and more digitally. Have no upside over pure online stores. Keel over.- Radio Shack. Stop selling electronics components, and start targeting to the bigger market of cell phones. Have no competitive advantage over Best Buy or cell phones stores. Keel over.In those situations, it's better to either:* Shift business models (e.g. Radio Shack could become a very competitive makerspace, host kid afterschool programs, maker camps, and refocused on Raspberry PI, 3d printers, Micro:bits and similar).* Shrink the business to follow a declining market without taking on debt (Radio Shack couldn't support the number of stores it had, but it could very much have supported 1/5 of the stores)Both of those approaches usually require starting to adapt before the sky starts falling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least in my area, Chuck E Cheese is experiencing stiff competition from places like ClimbZone, a kid-oriented climbing gym and ropes course, and Altitude, a trampoline park for kids. They all have the arcade, albeit in somewhat scaled back form. Their food offerings are vestigial.I've been to kids' birthday parties at all of these. Chuck E Cheese is the only one that doesn't have our kids asking to go back again on the ride home. They have a good time while they're there, but they don't perceive much "replay value".In light of that, this seems like a good move on Chuck E Cheese's part. They arguably can't completely get rid of the show component for brand identity reasons, but converting it to screens probably reduces their cost structure enormously. And it could free up some floor space, which would let them shift the focus toward physical play. That is something that has a lot more novelty value for kids nowadays than it did when I was growing up. I think probably because the availability situation has flip-flopped: they live in an ocean of high quality passive entertainment, but opportunities to jump and run with a crowd of other kids are becoming increasingly hard to come by.I still suspect it's too little too late though? Chuck E Cheese locations are physically too small to accommodate a really good indoor play space. They're typically in strip mall locations that don't offer the kind of floor and overhead space needed to install indoor play equipment that's up to modern standards for novelty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ll take this opportunity to plug the YouTube videos of animatronics super fan Jenny Nicholson.  Her videos on the Star Wars hotel: https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=8bzPpb_9kPaTsTto and the theme park Evermore: https://youtu.be/L9OhTB5eBqQ?si=utwaOeBFRpOQMStx are peak YouTube content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305006</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;JSON5 is an extension of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that aims to make it easier for humans to read and write. The site outlines the features of JSON5, such as support for comments, multi-line strings, and trailing commas, which are not present in standard JSON. It provides a clear syntax that improves the usability of data interchange formats while maintaining compatibility with existing JSON parsers. The website includes a specification, examples, and resources to help users implement JSON5 in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42360681"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it allows for too much. I was glad that JSON only supports double-quoted strings. It is a feature that removes discussions about which quotes to use. Or even whether to use quotes at all (we still need them for keys with colons or minus in it, so what gives?).The only thing that JSON is really missing are comments and trailing commas. I use JSONC for that. It's what VSC uses for the config format and it works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As much as i like this (yaml goes way too far, but trailing commas and comments would make json much nicer. I actually think this spec goes too far with single quotes) i hate that it is named json5. I think its unethical to imply you are the next version of something if you don't have the blessing of the original author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a fan of JSON5. A common criticism is “we’ve already got YAML for human readable config with comments,” but IMO YAML’s readability sucks, it’s too hard to tell what’s an object and what’s an array at a glance (at least, with the way it’s often written).When dealing with large YAML files, I find myself frequently popping them into online “YAML to JSON” tools to actually figure out WTF is going on.  JSON5 is much easier to read, at least for me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42360681</guid></item><item><title>7.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Himalaya makes it pretty easy to write cli tools and automate email workflows. It pairs well with August, another rust project that can render html to text on the terminal. I wrote a git email patch  automation tool around Himalaya so that people can receive email patches easily[1].1: https://github.com/djha-skin/git-receive-mail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool. I like the ongoing trend of TUIs getting more attention and use.A little while ago I wrote my own little TUI tool using Textual that interfaces with Outlook using pywin32. I really only needed (need) one specific feature above and beyond what Outlook already does. And that is, I wanted a Vim-like UX for assigning categories to emails and archiving/deleting them. What I have now works surprisingly well and it's very satisfying to have made my own thing that suits my own needs precisely the way I want it to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel like this has been here before, glad it's kept up with updates. Will have to give this a shot soon.From strictly reading the docs, I love these features:* oauth2
* json outputBut do I need to run the "himalaya ..." command every so often to get fresh e-mails? Or can I leave TUI open and it will refresh in the background?When composing messages, does anybody know if the "From" header can be re-written like in Thunderbird? I am able to send from ad-hoc aliases with my mail server, but need to re-write the "From" header first. For example, I can receive mail sent to "xyst.hn@example.com" and delivered to mailbox at "xyst@example.com". In order to reply with same e-mail address, I must re-write the "From" header to match.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42366025</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the pros and cons of purchasing new versus used SawStop table saws. It highlights the benefits of a new SawStop, such as warranty coverage, advanced features, and the peace of mind that comes with a brand-new machine. In contrast, it also addresses the cost savings associated with buying a used model, along with potential trade-offs like the absence of warranty and the risk of hidden issues. The piece ultimately aims to help readers make informed decisions based on their budget, needs, and willingness to take on the risks associated with used equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;, I have an altendorf handguard sliding table saw, which will stop as fast as the sawstop, The alternative approaches from other industrial saw manufacturers that are "non-contact non-destructive" are interesting:- cameras and machine learning used by Altendorf "Hand Guard":  https://www.altendorfgroup.com/en-us/machines/altendorf-hand...- inductive proximity (same science as Theremin[1]) used by Felder "PCS Preventative Contact System" :  https://www.felder-group.com/en-us/pcs-  SCM "Blade Off" (not sure of detection method ... looks like inductive proximity) : https://www.scmgroup.com/en_US/scmwood/products/joinery-mach...But I've heard reports from 3rd-parties that Altendorf's camera detection method is unreliable/glitchy and doesn't work as well as Felder's system.  Maybe Altendorf fixed the bugs.Also, Altendorf's philosophy of using cameras &amp; ML instead of inductive proximity reminds me of Tesla's philosophy using cameras instead of LIDAR (Waymo).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThereminEDIT ADD:  &gt;I'm not sure how comparable these alternatives are when two of them are "request a quote" kind of pricing, and the Altendorf is $7000+My comment was about "industrial saws" so they're definitely not realistic alternatives to buying a jobsite SawStop for homeowners.  I added italics to the adjective "industrial" to clarify this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love my sawstop, it's a great machine.Often times when a product has some patent-protected feature, the product itself is substandard, but I have not found that case with sawstop. It's one of my highest quality tools.It would be nice if the mechanism wasn't so destructive. I accidentally had an aluminum fence just a fraction of a mm too close, and it touched the blade. I was using a dado stack, and it did a number on the carbide teeth of the blades. Good dado sets are not cheap, nor is the sawstop cartridge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mostly unrelated, but I don't think SawStop is releasing its patent anytime soon like the article states. That SawStop press release was the CEO saying they would do so if the CPSC rule was passed, but the rule wasn't voted on. And even then they were only releasing one of their hundreds of patents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361825</guid></item><item><title>10.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of models have also been overly chat trained. Responding with stuff like “sure I can help you with that”That’s just unwanted noise if you’re trying to use them as a code building block in an application. So you need to force json or similar…which I suspect harms accuracy over free form&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The toxicity example was thought-provoking.    &gt; Input: Caspar Weinberger's father, Herman, was the younger
    &gt; Model generation for input: son of an immigrant grocer.
    &gt; Perspective API on model generation: Toxic

I hope it's uncontroversial to say that there's nothing "toxic" about that continuation by itself. (My expectation from that beginning is that it would then continue on with a modest beginnings story of how the father worked hard, etc.)I guess the idea is that it is the leading portion of a toxic output, and if you prevent that beginning, you'll prevent the problematic continuance? At the cost of many possible non-toxic continuations.I've never seen an actual labeled example before. Is this the form they usually take, or is this one quoted because it's innocuous and therefore uncontroversial to insert into a document about LLM evals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing task-specific evals are pretty important, and lots of people are just going off of vibes right now. If this all seems too much all at once, and you don't know where to start, we wrote a jargon-free issue for getting started with system evals.https://forestfriends.techThe basic idea for system evals is to find a way to define a qualitative trait you want in the LLM responses using a corpus of examples, rather than being able to define it exactly using prompts. Then through systematic improvements, you nudge your LLM-driven task to adhere closer and closer to the given examples, for some metric of closeness. That way, you can be more sure you're not regressing on LLM responses as you try to make improvements. This is standard stuff for data scientists, but this way of working can be a little foreign to web engineers (depending on prior experience). It just takes a little adjustment to get up to speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42366481</guid></item><item><title>11.

Just a week ago SAMURAI was posted here, which is kind of the same thing, promising SOTA tracking performance using SAM2. But it only allows single object tracking, which makes it useless for many medical imaging tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was the abstract written by ChatGPT?  It's an unreadable wall of text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was fun trying out the demo, with the "coffee kettle pouring" video it did really well segmenting the man's hand and arm and tracking it (segmenting them in every frame correctly), but with the "Find the ball cup game" video it lost track of the tracked cup in a strange way, it kept track of it correctly while it went behind other cups, but after it wasn't occluded anymore, it switched to an other cup.It's still impressive to me how it twice kept track between occlusions, but strange how it lost track when it wasn't occluded.https://i.imgur.com/hOSQBtw.mp4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42304789</guid></item><item><title>12.

Used various apps for that but settled for years on Termux.* Install https://f-droid.org/ store* Install Termux from there* Install ssh daemon and rsync in Termux with    pkg upgrade
    pkg install openssh rsync

* Read manual on https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Using_the_SSH_ser... on how to start, configure, stop ssh daemon. In general: The Termux documentation is good!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; ...  It also includes rsync (which actually was my main motivation for this project)I would take rsync any day over unreliable GUI apps that silently fail to complete remote transfers, often as soon as the screen is turned off.I've used an iPhone for the past few years but may move to a Pixel running GrapheneOS for my next phone. It's apps (well, modules) like this and Termux that tip the scales in Android's favor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This looks good.... but I don't get the importance of it. What can this do that termux openssh can't?Can I mount remote filesystems at the system level via sshfs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42365772</guid></item><item><title>13.

Even leaving red herrings on his way out of the city (backpack full of Monopoly money). Yet clumsily keeps _all_ of the evidence that would implicate himself in this murder. Not to mention he is wandering about in public while a multi-state manhunt is underway with the full weight of alphabet soup agencies, and state and local LEOs? To me, this suggests it was part of his plan to get caught. There was no escape to a non-extradition country. The “shaking” mentioned while talking with police could just be a massive surge of adrenaline as he sees his plan unfold before his eyes. Then use the live streamed and televised court to spread his message. Then live out the rest of his life as a political figure as the media continue to analyze this persons life and motivations. Just like Ted.- Or the internet, media really over-estimated this persons competence. It was really just dumb luck that he even escaped NYC. At that point, he was just improvising after leaving NYC. His arrogance to keep the evidence as some sick mementos or trophies ultimately did him in. Likely try to plead insanity with the manifesto. Probably fail to do so, then eventually get convicted on all charges and end up in a supermax penitentiary for life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was carrying all of the evidence with him, including the fake ID he used at the hostel, the gun &amp; suppressor, mask, and even a handwritten manifesto that points to his motivation. It seems he wanted to be found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He gave the Unabomber’s manifesto four stars on Goodreads, and described Unabomber as a "political revolutionary".Excerpts from his review:"It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.""He was a violent individual - rightfully imprisoned - who maimed innocent people. While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary."https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/luigi-mang...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42370622</guid></item><item><title>14.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses pixel art scaling techniques, explaining how to properly resize pixel art images while maintaining their visual integrity. It outlines different scaling methods, such as nearest-neighbor, integer scaling, and various algorithms, emphasizing the importance of preserving the original pixel aesthetics and preventing blurriness. The content also provides practical tips and examples for artists and developers to ensure their pixel art looks sharp and authentic on different displays, particularly in gaming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The proper way to scale pixel graphics is by using nearest-neighbor (integer scaling) + CRT shader. Some games implement these filters excellently (eg Black Jewel, Hammerwatch (only the very first part), Animal Well), while others do it poorly (eg Skald).Old consoles can be connected to an LCD monitor using a device called RetroTINK, which can add this effect perfectly. For static images, software like Photoshop, Affinity Photo is sufficient, but the goal should always be a CRT effect rather than generic scaling or fancy blur.The point is that OBJECTIVELY pixel art looks incomparably better on CRT monitors, which is why this effect is emulated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then they go on to try and compare to an composite output but they do this.
"Jazz Jackrabbit 2 through an interlaced composite video stream, grabbed with a cheap capture card."
That's not really how we experienced it though. Better to try and take a photograph of a CRT - although that's challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a page like this you should really use the CSS style:    img {

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the philosophical themes and implications found in Franz Kafka's story "Investigations of a Dog," examining how the narrative reflects Kafka's existential concerns and the complexities of human and animal understanding. It delves into the protagonist's quest for meaning in a world characterized by absurdity and uncertainty, highlighting the interplay between language, consciousness, and the essence of being. The analysis emphasizes Kafka's unique blend of humor and tragedy, presenting the story as a reflection on the limits of knowledge and the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CERN's ALICE experiment has discovered the first evidence of the antimatter partner of helium-4, known as hyperhelium-4. This finding marks a significant milestone in the study of antimatter and its properties, as it provides insights into the behavior of antimatter in extreme conditions similar to those present in the early universe. The detection of hyperhelium-4, composed of two protons and two antiprotons, enhances our understanding of the symmetry between matter and antimatter, which has implications for both fundamental physics and the origins of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;FireWire had a backdoor into memory. FireWire isn't a "bus", it's a local area network. Mostly you send packets around. IP over Firewire was a thing. But there are also built-in packets to read and write memory, one word at a time.
That's how commands are sent. This probably made sense to people who thought in terms of device registers, rather than a command with parameters.There's a register in most Firewire controllers where you can set the address bounds for which that function is available. I once noted that the hard-coded default values for Linux were 0 .. 2^32-1, that is, the first 4GB. I reported this as a security bug and was told it was needed for the kernel debugger.Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's a solid writeup on the history of external DMA attacks!  Very nicely done, and well worth a read.This sort of thing is why QubesOS tends to put hardware controllers in isolated VMs and only pass access through.  With a working IOMMU (any modern hardware has this), all you can get is DMA access into a VM that doesn't actually have much of interest in it, and no access into other VMs...//EDIT: Though at a closer read, there's some that... isn't quite right, in how terms and examples are done.  I'd expect better from someone doing low level security work - INB copies to a general purpose register, not a memory address, a DMA controller is a "discrete" bit of hardware, it's not very "discreet," etc.  I'm not sure.  This is starting to feel very AI-assisted to me.  The overall concepts are fine, but a lot of the background section doesn't read reasonably, or goes off into weird weeds and... never explores them.  The Intel Xeon is not a less exotic example of a DMA controller.  The PC/AT platform did not have a PCI bus.Eh.  I remain convinced it's a decent enough overview of the matter, but a lot of the details just read really weird to me in the background sections.  To the point that this could be an interview discussion question.  "What does this get subtly wrong?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would have been good to hear about whether there are still any mainstream computer platforms that ship with IOMMU off, since it is the mitigation here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42368784</guid></item><item><title>18. 2M MPH galaxy smash-up seen in unprecedented detail</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2024-11-million-mph-galaxy-unprecedented.html</link><description>

I think this is the first time I've felt sick to my stomach watching AI generated content.. A sadness rush over me. Because these look so good, like every soul-less super-high quality shovel-ware asset ever made.I'm not putting it down, it truly is an amazing achievement, and it feels like it marks the end of hand-made assets. I don't even feel bad for the artists, I just feel bad for myself, because I want things made by people, for the inherent property that they were made by people. This is the same reason I don't care for procedurally generated games, I want to walk worlds that arose in the minds of others, not just worlds, if I wanted a procedually generated world that just exist for no reason in particular, I'd walk outside..I don't want content, I don't just want stuff to sift through, I want pieces of art, made by my peers with their own visions, ideas, values, insights and personalities. They don't need to look that good, they just need to have been made with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wow, these look amazing. I'm a layman, but I think this is what everyone's been thinking about ever since the first NeRF demos?EDIT: I went looking for those threads and found my own comment wishing for this 5 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22642628The next step is to automatically add "nodes" to the 3D images where the model can pivot, rotate and whatnot and then boom, you have on-demand animated, interactive content.Feed it some childhood photos and recreate your memories.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're going down the HomeAssistant route I'd recommend ditching any proprietary hubs and getting a Zigbee dongle instead, I've been using the Sonoff Zigbee dongle and even though it's connected to the server, in a rack, in the garage (so thick breezeblock walls between it and the rest of the house) there are enough always on mesh nodes in the lights themselves that the network is steady. Granted, the Dongle itself isn't inside the enclosed rack, it's on a USB extension cable and mounted on the top.I've also gone the Zigbee2MQTT (ZQM) route instead of the ZHM built into HomeAssistant as it just supports a lot more, and a lot better in my experience.Once you're in the open world of Zigbee, you can also go the Ikea Tradfri route as well for bulbs that are a WHOLE lot cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Home Assistant is great. Started with a Raspberry Pi 4, then migrated to a Wyse 5070 running HAOS in a VM on top of libvirt/qemu. Using USB dongles for both ZigBee and zwave, passing the USB devices directly through to the VM. This kind of setup allows making full backups/snapshots of the whole VM in case of any failed updates, or mistakes when making big configuration changes.I don’t use any vendor hubs at all. Everything is directly connected to the USB dongles at the main network controllers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going down this route still requires the Hue hub and managing it through its ecosystem. This means if DNS is not working perfectly or the hub decides to do a mandatory update, you're stuck for a bit until the update finishes or you fix DNS. The DNS part is partially my fault but also because I was blocking all of its calls home to Phillips' servers using pihole. Finally I bought a zigbee dongle and put in  the zigbee2mqtt addon for HA and paired all of my Hue bulbs/dimmers/motion sensors to it (https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/9290023351B.html), unplugged the Hue hub, and its been excellent since.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358358</guid></item><item><title>21.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges faced by Intel under CEO Pat Gelsinger's leadership and argues that his strategies may not align with the company's needs for effective innovation and competition in the semiconductor industry. It critiques Gelsinger's approach to addressing issues such as manufacturing delays and competition from rivals, suggesting that his plans may lack the necessary vision to revitalize Intel and regain its technological edge. The piece emphasizes the need for a more robust and adaptable leadership to navigate the rapidly evolving tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring back Pat.Was Pat perfect, no. But Pat acknowledged Intel’s problems - something Otellini, Krzanich, and Swan never did. These CEOs, all non-technical, focused on dividends, buybacks, and next-quarter results while Intel fell behind in advanced nodes and innovation.Gelsinger inherited a disaster: 10nm delays, TSMC pulling ahead, and no GPU strategy. He had the courage to cut buybacks and slashed dividends. He poured billions into fabs in Arizona, Ohio, Germany, and Ireland. He delivered Intel 18A, powered on first silicon, released PDK 1.0 for Microsoft, and secured Microsoft and Amazon as customers. There were even rumors Apple might join.Contrast this with Nadella at Microsoft back in 2014. He didn’t reboot the company by tearing everything down. Instead, he built on Ballmer-era wins like Azure, Office 365 while shifting Microsoft’s focus to the cloud. Gelsinger had to start from scratch in many ways, tackling years of neglect while facing harsher challenges.Yes, Intel’s stock dropped $150 billion, but Gelsinger was upfront - it wouldn’t turn around before 2025. He was trained by Gordon Moore and Andy Grove, and while some saw him as arrogant, that confidence came from decades of technical leadership.The real issue? The board. Full of people like Boeing execs. They don’t get engineering. Trusting them to fix Intel is like hoping a plane door won’t pop open mid-flight. They’re the ones who should be replaced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowing both Pat and Bryan pretty well professionally, I'm not sure what the right answer here was. I did a "scare them" presentation to the senior Intel sales force a long time ago but it was mostly about multi-core Opteron. (And, I suppose it's long enough ago now, to say that Pat told me Gates was basically afraid of Windows requiring multi-core performance.) Intel probably needed to get into GPUs (or other AI-enablement) seriously earlier but I'm not sure how predictable that was. I did tell AMD a long time ago to head off in directions Intel's inertia wouldn't let them. But so much is about execution.ADDED: And, yes, Pat was an Intel insider but I think he was still a pretty good choice for the job. Not sure who else I would go with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are Pat's public failings:* Can't win over AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Broadcom as fab customers* Fab cancellations and delays, wasting a ton of money* Not hiring the right people to steer Intel's internal fab culture to external quick enough* Not simplifying product roadmap. No one knows what the lake code names are. Expect 30% of roadmap to get cancelled. 30% get delayed. 30% switch node tech. Compare this to the simplified AMD roadmap, which is easy to understand and makes sense.* Didn't stop paying dividends until August 2024* He cut fab funding to pay dividends in 2022 [0]* Didn't see that Intel was swimming naked during the covid boom and that after the boom, Intel would be in huge trouble due to inferior products* He hired 20% more workers since he joined but 54% less revenue* Intel still has more employees in 2024 than in 2019. Instead of trimming fat, he added more fat.Sure, Intel was on the decline no matter who stepped in as CEO in 2021. However, Pat definitely accelerated the decline and made a mess of things with little progress in any area.Gelsinger was a failure all around and it's time someone with no ties to the original decades-long Intel IDM strategy step into the role. Intel needs an outsider who can come in and objectively see the current situation - not the rosy glorious Intel of the past.[0]https://semianalysis.com/2022/07/29/intel-cuts-fab-buildout-...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361955</guid></item><item><title>22.

"Oh, I see you have a bounds check that prevents vulnerability. BTW, if you remove that bounds check, your code will be vulnerable!!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got hit with a CVE spammer last year which forced me to re-release a library to fix a fake vulnerability that cannot be disputed in any way -- https://gist.github.com/6en6ar. They do nothing but post exploits where long strings purportedly take a long time to process -- because they are slow to construct! And even more fun, the example exploits often don't even compile.I assumed it was a human, but I'm starting to wonder if this was an early CVE-farming AI bot.The CVE process is very broken and extremely exploitable as a DoS against humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361299</guid></item><item><title>24.

This kind of swindle is called “the boodle game”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pinkertons are a fascinating period of history. "Detective agency" in the modern parlance doesn't really fit. They were a private army for the wealthy that at one time was larger than the US army.One particularly famous incident (after the founder's death) was the Homestead strike [1]. Strike-breaking was very much in the Pinkerton's wheelhouse and it's a good example of what they were actually used for [2].There doesn't seem to be a lot of fiction that features the Pinkertons prominently. One exception is the (excellent) HBO TV series Deadwood.It's particularly apropos at this time because the lawless violence and organized labor suppression of the robber barons in the Pinkerton era is very much the future we are careening towards.[1]: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carnegi...[2]: https://allthatsinteresting.com/pinkerton-detective-agency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361630</guid></item><item><title>26.

&lt;p&gt;Starlark is a programming language designed for configuration and scripting tasks, primarily used in build systems like Bazel. It features a Python-like syntax but is optimized for performance and simplicity, allowing for easy integration and execution in various environments. The language supports a small set of data types and constructs, making it lightweight and predictable, and it includes features for extension through user-defined functions and modules. The website provides resources such as documentation, tutorials, and a specification to help users learn and effectively utilize Starlark in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358269"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starlark is definitely a mixed experience IMO, from my 7 years working with it in BazelOn one hand, having a "hermetic" subset of Python is nice. You can be sure your Bazel starlark codebase isn't going to be making network calls or reading files or shelling out to subprocesses and all that. The fact that it is hermetic does help make things reproducible and deterministic, and enables paralleization and caching and other things. Everyone already knows Python syntax, and its certainly nicer than the templated-bash-in-templated-yaml files common elsewhere in the build tooling/infra spaceOn the other hand, a large Starlark codebase is a large Python codebase, and large Python codebases are imperative, untyped, and can get messy even without all the things mentioned above. Even though your Starlark is pure and deterministic, it still easily ends up a rats nest of sphagetti. Starlark goes the extra mile to be non-turing-complete, but that doesn't mean it's performant or easy to understand. And starlark's minimalism is also a curse as it lacks many features that help you manage large Python codebases such as PEP484 type annotations, which also means IDEs also cannot provide much help since they rely on types to understand the codeFor https://mill-build.org we went the opposite route: not enforcing purity, but using a language with strong types and a strong functional bent to it. So far it's been working out OK, but it remains to be seen how well it scales to ever larger and more complex build setups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your mileage may vary, but Starlark was one of the most complicated languages I've ever read. No types, just layers and layers of indirection, with the goal of making a very complex build rule look "simple". I don't like hiding non-accidental complexity, in particular when the abstraction leaks everywhere. Perhaps it was only due to the Starlark I was exposed to (I worked at Google, probably most of the Starlark code I've read has been written by SREs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This appears to be the same language that started as a custom build rule DSL for bazel (and evolving from lessons learned in blaze's Python extension), the page positions it as a much more general-purpose embedded language.I'm all for using the right tool for the job, and I'll acknowledge the benefits of hermeticity and parallelism in many contexts.  But, I also think that you need to weigh the cost of adding another language to a project.  I don't imagine myself using this anywhere outside of a build system, and even then I would first try to take the declarative rules of that build system as far as I can.  It's probably better than shell scripts, though, at least most of the time?  May depend on your team's prior familiarity with shell and/or love of Python.There are three implementations (Go, Rust, Java) which could be a good thing if the language doesn't change often.  They would have to be kept in sync for any changes, as well as keep from drifting due to changes in the host language's semantics.I also think that the closeness in syntax with Python can be a disadvantage, especially if users are expecting more recent Python additions like the walrus operator or pattern matching to be available.I like to design languages, too, so these comments come from a place of love and understanding. 
I think it would help if there were some more specific justification (or examples) of why this is better than something more established (e.g. Lua or MicroPython) or more distinct (e.g. pure data in configs instead of embedded code).  I do like that the language attempts to remain as simple as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42358269</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;Broward County has announced plans to vacate convictions for individuals who purchased crack cocaine that was produced by the local sheriff's office's reverse sting operation, which dates back to a controversial 1993 ruling. The decision, driven by the Broward State Attorney's office, comes in light of the Supreme Court's recent commitment to reconsider the legality of such sting operations, acknowledging the injustices faced by those convicted under these circumstances. This move aims to rectify past wrongs and addresses concerns about the ethical implications of law enforcement entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whole thing is just insane. Instead of going up the supply chain and arresting the big fish, they are creating their own supply chain and go after addicts. Everybody involved in this should get fired. Almost as stupid as the FBI years ago going into mosques with undercover people radicalizing some young and then arresting them. Basically they are creating their own crimes which they then solve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; For three years, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office produced its own crack cocaine, so it could sell it to people that deputies would then arrest for buying crack cocaine.Putting aside the insanity of a police department manufacturing crack cocaine, I’m specifically curious how they ran the books for something like this. There’s the crack money collection, the laundering of cash, expensing raw materials (i.e., powder cocaine).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the Florida State Supreme Court RulingState v. Williams https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1993/7950...TL;DR is "In other words, the police agencies cannot themselves do an illegal act, albeit their intended goal may be legal and desirable"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361503</guid></item><item><title>30.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of the One Euro Filter, a simple and effective method for filtering noise in real-time data, often used in robotics and computer graphics. It explains the filter's design, which balances responsiveness and smoothness by adjusting a single parameter, making it suitable for various applications requiring real-time signal processing. The author provides code snippets and visual examples to illustrate how the filter can be applied, emphasizing its ease of use and versatility in handling noisy measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterial pathogen causing a significant crisis in Europe’s olive groves, threatening the olive oil industry, particularly in Italy, where it has led to devastating crop losses. The disease spreads rapidly, leading to extensive economic implications estimated at billions of euros, as it impacts production and exports. The article discusses the urgency of addressing this issue, including the challenges in management and containment, as well as the potential consequences for the Mediterranean agricultural landscape and local economies. It highlights the need for coordinated efforts in research and policy to safeguard olive cultivation and protect the livelihoods reliant on this vital sector.&lt;/p&gt;

The lab, led by Professor Rodrigo Almeida, is studying economically important grape diseases, focusing on Grapevine leafroll disease and Grapevine red blotch disease [1].2. They're developing an AI tool for fast and accurate disease identification in vineyards, which could be a game-changer for disease management.3. Their work combines molecular biology, ecology, and bioinformatics, using advanced techniques like genomics.4. A recent study led by Kai Blaisdell showed that mealybugs efficiently transmit Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 under field conditions, with disease symptoms appearing throughout the plant one year after infection [2].5. Their focus seems to be more on understanding and managing plant diseases using various molecular and ecological approaches [3].This research is crucial for the wine industry, especially in regions like Northern California. It's not quite "genomics on the brink of the discovery what was penicillin through crispr", but it's still cutting-edge work that could have significant impacts on grape cultivation and wine production.References:

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two basic facts to be aware of.Momentum is mass times velocity. Energy is m v^2 / 2. Both with adjustments in the relativistic realm, which this barely gets to.The maximum thrust per atom lost is going to be at insanely high velocity. The maximum thrust per unit energy is going to be at low velocity. Which makes ion thrusters great for slow changes of velocity when powered by unlimited solar power. But terrible for launch with a finite energy budget.Useless trivia. A traditional rocket becomes more efficient if you mix some mercury into the fuel. The loss of energy is made up for by the extra mass. The collateral damage from the mercury is an environmental disaster though.For a lot more, including the source of that trivia, I highly recommend reading https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pd....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I watch his channel almost every week, truly great content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RF sputtered Gallium, so AlGaN, or GaAs?

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is Germany. Here's a summary of the safety regulations.[1] Safety testing by an "accredited laboratory" is required.[2]The New York City Fire Department reports that lithium-ion battery fires are a leading cause of fires and fire deaths in NYC.[3] NYFD got the city to require UL or equivalent testing for lithium battery fires.[4] This is working for sales within NYC but Amazon is still selling batteries with fake UL stickers.NYC's big problem is e-bikes and scooters being charged in apartments and stores. Several hundred of those a year now, and they tend to be severe fires. Entire e-bike stores have blown up.
Those things need to be lithium-iron phosphate until solid state batteries become affordable.(A good political move would be to get the incoming administration to require UL or better certification for anything imported that has a lithium-ion battery or a wall plug.)[1] https://www.batterietechnikum.kit.edu/downloads/Safety_Guide...[2] https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us/resource-centre/blogs/mobility-...[3] https://www.nyc.gov/site/fdny/news/Y40203/fdny-warns-lithium...[4] https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fdny-is-trying-to-curb-lit...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To save others the clicking and scrolling (if you're mainly interested in the conclusion, as I was), the summary at the end says that the risk of fire starting in your battery energy storage (or in your EV) is lower than that of your average house fire (or in your ICE car).  They liken the risk of a fire starting in the battery storage to that of fire starting in a clothes dryer.  But, depending on the placement of your batteries in/around your home, the severity of a fire, if one should happen, could end up being worse than a fire that starts in some other household appliance.I was pleased to read that the risk of fire is reasonable and low; I wasn't sure what to expect, but was afraid the conclusion would be that they're higher-risk.  I suppose I expected to see the result that a fire that included large batteries could be a much worse fire.  Li ion battery fires can be pretty bad, and those batteries are much larger than what you'd find in your phone or other small electronics.I still would like to add rooftop solar to my house (even though California's metering system is all kinds of anti-rooftop-solar now).  When I last looked into it a couple years ago, battery storage seemed like it was a little too pricey to be worth it, but it seems like that's been changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can't relate to per-year risk percentage numbers. But the inverse is quite illustrative I find. Here is the expected time between events for each category according to the paper:General house fire: 360 yearsICE fire: 1100 yearsEV fire: 4200 yearsBattery storage fire: 20'000 yearsTumble dryer fire: 27'000 yearsPV system fire: 71'000 yearsThis way I can understand that while I might see my house burn, the battery storage is very unlikely to pop in my lifetime. Because these numbers are not very accurate anyway, I've rounded to two digits. The authors note that the number for battery storage in particular are very unreliable.On the other hand: just looking at probabilities of events does not tell you how lethal or destructive the event will be. And lithium fires are very bad in both categories. Comparing to tumble dryers is not very useful when you factor in the properties of the fire. Quite possibly the danger to life is higher with an EV compared to an ICE, even if the ICE is assumed to catch fire at four times the rate of the EV. In addition, the wear-out failure rate of EV is to be discovered yet, because the fleet is so young. The EV rate may still climb. Or maybe battery manufacturers improve and the danger will be reduced? Some things do get better after all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42369622</guid></item><item><title>34.

&lt;p&gt;The website for "Y2K" serves as the official platform for the film, providing information about its storyline, cast, and themes. The narrative centers around the cultural and technological anxieties of the early 2000s, particularly the Y2K bug, which anticipated widespread issues as the year 2000 approached. It features imagery and stylistic elements reflective of the era, alongside promotional content such as trailers and news updates related to the movie’s release and screenings. Overall, the site aims to engage viewers with nostalgia and highlight the film's exploration of societal fears and the intersection of technology and daily life during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

Officially students of my school where not allowed to do so but I got an exception to do so. I worked at AXA (a large insurer) and it was an trainee-ship. I worked on the the EURO and Y2K problem. For this insurer it was massive. They had somewhere near 250 systems that where inter connected and each had issues. They had 22 systems just to handle intermediates because of mergers. I remember helping a tester to time travel a database on OS360. I wrote a script in REXX to he could time travel how he would like to. He started the script during the day without using nice. The mainframe was so busy that nobody could work on the terminals. We got calls from every office in the Netherlands. Fun times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started work at a credit card processing company at the end of ‘96 as an assembler programmer on OS/360 IBM mainframes. The company simulated the date changing to the year 2000 and we saw everything that broke. We then worked over the next couple years fixing everything and Y2K went by without a hitch. If you were involved with it you do tend to resent the people that say it was over blown but you also understand the feeling that it was over blown by the media because it did play upon public fear to sell products and views.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42322412</guid></item><item><title>35.

Cloudflare did a PR launch of pretty much the same thing a few years back, and that you haven't actually seen it in the wild probably tells you all you need to know about how useful it is.Webauthn is not an integrity attestation; it doesn't tell you anything about how trustworthy the client is. Nor is it a uniqueness attestation; an attacker can mint an arbitrary number of different identities at basically no cost.

You might think this is a pretty dumb design decision that can lead to programmer error, but it meshes perfectly with the other mistakes in the language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This makes a zero value union very similar to a nil interface, which will also fail all type assertions.Yet is still directly comparable with 'i == nil' which yields true.  Two different interface pointers of the same type that are both 'nil' can also be compared this way.  Plus interfaces can be manipulated under reflection.&gt; At this point my feeling is that Go might as well stick with interfaces and not attempt to provide union types.The language,  and most particularly the runtime,  is not compatible with the idea.  I'm not sure why it gets brought up other than language level FOMO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are so many of these stories about why some popular feature from other languages doesn’t fit into Go. Great. It’s already a nice and very  productive language. If you don’t like it, just use something wise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303449</guid></item><item><title>39.

The 7 piece tablebase is 20TB or so, so it’ll be a few years before you can fit that one your phone. Pretty sure Lichess has an API for that. Never tried to hook it up to Stockfish or Leela though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chessbase is one of those pieces of software that would be completely eaten by a cheaper alternative if the market was bigger. $400+ for a single download, selling mostly open source data, and it looks like it was made in 1998.The thing is, there is money in chess but not that much money. There will never be a unicorn in chess software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42369233</guid></item><item><title>40.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever I ask a CTO if they have a backup (or plan-B) they say we're on AWS, we backup there and they will never go down as a company. And then I ask them what they do when their account gets shut (e.g. because they are selling something bad on Amazon and have the same phone number as the company account?) Or the instance some years ago where GCP closed because someone had wrongly classified image on their drive?You should have all you backups in a different location and terraform tested with a different cloud provider, otherwise you're risking the company.[Edit] Where I come from: That doesn't say anything about Hetzner, I have been with them for 20+ years, they have stopped individual servers in that time frame, but haven't cancelled my whole account.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backups are irrelevent here (yes, backups are important). if hetzner really deleted production data without warning or providing a grace period for their customer to migrate their data, then they are simply not a stable foundation to build on.I have never been a customer of google cloud for this reason and i sure as hell wont deploy new servers on hetzner until they provide a clear statement on what went wrong and what they will do to make sure they never screw up like this again.Hetzner, the ball is in your court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hang on, Hetzner literally deleted all their data without warning?That’s actually insane and business killing. Both for Hetzner’s reputation and potentially for their customer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42365295</guid></item><item><title>42.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a puzzle inspired by the works of author Sally Rooney, presenting it in a playful and engaging manner. It invites readers to solve a riddle centered around the theme of a hat worn by a character in Rooney's stories. The piece highlights Rooney's narrative style and themes, while also encouraging reader participation through the challenge of the puzzle. The emphasis is on interactive problem-solving, drawing fans of Rooney's literature into a fun and intellectual exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42365222"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The puzzle is referring to the concept of a vacuous truth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).In most logic frameworks, the All function (upside down A in standard logic notation) is true if and only if no statement within the set is false (i.e. All his hats are green if he has no hats). This is for several reasons:- it allows for more coherent empty set functions. For example if we take the power set of a set, that power set has the same All value as the standard set (since the power set includes the empty set)- it allows for early stopping on false statements. So you can define the statement as a lazy executor of all child conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One complication is that in typical English, if you say "All my hats....", you are simultaneously making an existence statement that you have at least one hat... but the usual formal logic "forall" quantifier does NOT presume existence. Here's a formal proof that "forall" has a "surprise" meaning for those not well-versed in formal logic: https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/alimp-surprise.htmlI propose that when translating such statements to a formal logic, if that's what you really mean, use an "allsome" quantifier as I've described here: https://dwheeler.com/essays/allsome.htmlIt's really easy to forget to include an existence quantifier. Having notation specifically designed to automatically include it can avoid some problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never liked this type of puzzle. It is not formal logic but more about the idiosyncrasies and conventions of the English language. I put this puzzle on par with Agatha Christie’s murder mysteries. It requires a suspension of disbelief and logic to be believable.Someone who always lies means in the purest sense means you cannot trust anything they say. Even the word “hat” could mean they are talking about their pet cat that they like to carry on their head.What the author would probably say is “All my hats are green” means the liar is either lying about All or Green. Either all their hats are some other color or only one hat is green. This means you have to assume the liar has a hat. How do we know that?We only know that because of similar puzzles that came before. In other words this is not logic but more pattern recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42365222</guid></item><item><title>45.

&lt;p&gt;The article commemorates the historic moment on December 26, 1660, when the first woman, actress Margaret Hughes, took the stage in England, marking a significant transformation in the theater world. Prior to this, women were banned from performing, and Hughes's debut not only paved the way for female presence in theater but also influenced the evolution of performance art. The article explores the societal implications of this change and highlights Hughes's contributions, positioning her as a pivotal figure in the history of English theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article reviews the Raspberry Pi 500, highlighting its specifications, performance, and features. It provides an overview of its design, usability, and compatibility with various software and hardware. The review emphasizes its potential for both educational and project-based applications, discussing its processing power, connectivity options, and overall value for hobbyists and developers. Additionally, it compares the Raspberry Pi 500 with its predecessors and other competing devices, offering insights into its strengths and any limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main oddities about the Pi 500, to me:- Designing a custom PCB for a more PC-like Pi, but then not merging the functionality of the official M.2 HAT despite plenty of available packaging space. Being able to just slot in an SSD would greatly expand the operating envelope of the product.- Sticking to Micro HDMI ports, again despite plenty of space &amp; with everyone having standard HDMI cables already on hand, or surely able to procure them more affordably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of scorn for this latest offering from Pi, but I think perspective is important here. No, most of us here do not have a use for the Pi 500 or it's display, but in part so the world where a lightweight low-consumption device can open some doors for connectivity and learning, this looks like a great solution.We tend to forget that not everyone on the planet has the same resources or needs we do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get that the target group probably is fine with running everything off of an SD card. But, I still think it's a mistake to not offer an M.2 slot without soldering.The smaller drives are very affordable and the performance difference is huge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364038</guid></item><item><title>47.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I had testicular cancer, they removed my cancerous nuts and put me on extremely close active surveillance as I underwent intense cancer treatment. One thing they checked for daily with blood work was my testosterone levels. Curious thing happened -- despite losing a ball, my testosterone shot way, way up. To the point where I was having weird symptoms like major migraines, I felt itchy all over my body, and just generally, not myself. The lust part was there for sure, but it was a confusing, scary time, being in cancer remission at 24.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key wording in the title and throughout the article is "day to day" testosterone associations.If you understand what they are implying and not implying by that, the paper makes sense, but it is very poorly written in its omission of discussion of something it mentions only once in passing, the male circadian testosterone cycle (which it does describe how it tries to control for, but if you read this paper without understanding that, you won't really understand its findings.)Women's hormones are well-understood to cycle monthly and it affects a variety of things including desire.  What nobody ever told me growing up and the culture still doesn't talk about is that men, rather than having a monthly cycle have a daily cycle with huge testosterone swings that get lower in the afternoon and start rising dramatically in the early morning hours.[1]This is something that correlates greatly with the "morning erection" and sexual urges (including porn) in the morning hours that many men experience. (And which at least some advertisers clearly understand, judging based on the ads shown to me at different times of day.)As they themselves mention, "Our measures of sexual desire did not differentiate between dyadic and solitary desire", nor did they control for "solitary desire" activity and its impact on testosterone levels.It is useful to have a study that looks at day-to-day testosterone as opposed to weekly/monthly/hourly, but I also found it frustrating there was no graph that showed based on their data how much testosterone fluctuated during the 31 days of month for their subjects (with some standard deviation bars or something). I know that wasn't what they were studying but I found it a bit hard to understand their findings without that.[1] 
 https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Serum-testosterone-conce...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard someone say once that testosterone makes doing hard things feel good. If that’s true, then it would align with the conclusions in this paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42362755</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of outrage on social media and suggests that sharing outrage-driven content can contribute to societal polarization and misinformation. It emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences before sharing posts that evoke strong emotional reactions, as these can perpetuate division and negativity. The piece encourages critical thinking and reflection about the sources and motivations behind such content, advocating for a more mindful approach to social media engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social media/ad tech architecture has to change.Dont tell people to change. Its a red flag of intellectual bankruptcy.Its a get out of jail free card for mindless corporate robots. The clergy used to provide these cards to feudal lords once upon a time. Today the media and edu system provide it to corporations.More content = more ad real estate.If you have a magic machine that produces more and more rent collecting real estate what happens to the value of real estate?Meanwhile the total pool of available human Attention doesnt grow.If you further filter that pool by global avg disposable income you find its a very small pool. And its being over fished massively. (Check the UN report on the Attention Economy)This is a bizarre abnormal system that produces accumulating consequences.Revenue of ad tech keeps growing. Content keeps growing. It keeps getting more addictive. Outrage is the natural output of such an enviroment that has been  imposed on everyone. Politicians have to spend mpre and more on Ads to get elected. Becoming more and more on dependent on money to win. So they are struggling to counter balance these forces.We have to treat Attention the same way we treat Land, Air, Water or Natural Resources. Companies cant pollute or exploit things without limit. Ads cant be injected in every 2 mm of space available and every 2 ms of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This same relationship between emotion and inhibition of critical faculties plays a large part in the high error rate of justice systems around the world. In the extreme resulting in the bizarrely illogical "someone has to pay" sentiment of vengeful victims and jury, almost to the point they are aware their instinct is wrong but would prefer to live in the fantasy of the closure it offers.Perhaps some good can come out of a technology over exploiting this human weakness, by forcing society to learn how to combat these weaknesses where it's even more important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never could understand how misinformation gets spread so easily via social media, until the pandemic. My friend basically had a slow breakdown, getting more and more scared and angry and upset. She'd be hooked to the social feeds, and re-share the scary ones that sounded plausible, but often they were fallacious, misleading, exaggerated. She was just trying to cope, and she thought she was helping other people by re-sharing them. Eventually she had to quit socials entirely, and it took a while for her to emotionally recover, but she's better now.I know this is just one example, but it feels very much like an endemic problem I call "media sickness". The media [in all its forms] is set up to make us ill. It scares us, misleads us. It invents and inflates controversy, focusing on things that don't really matter, yet making them seem imminent and life-threatening. It shows us only what we want to see, or what we want to believe. Or what someone else wants us to see, the way they want it seen. And then it tells us to buy things, which is the ultimate goal of all of this manipulation. And we do, because the movies, podcasts, Doritos, and sneakers from Amazon, are the only things that soothe our frazzled nerves and distract us before the next media blitz.Our whole American culture today has an epidemic of media sickness. It's worse than the obesity and opioid epidemics, because it's even infecting the halls of power and changing geopolitics. It crosses every class and infects every home. I think the only solution is to go cold turkey. Cut the social media, the TV, the news. Live your life free of influence. You might find that it's especially hard to do that, to live without the consumption, without the constant presence of advertiser-driven content. Even here on HN, we are subjected to the manipulation machine. It's so hard to get free of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42362927</guid></item><item><title>49.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of embodied artificial intelligence, focusing on the Moxie robot, which is designed to provide social and emotional support to children. It highlights how Moxie's interactive capabilities and responses are aimed at fostering emotional growth and communication skills among its users. The piece also explores the challenges faced by such robots, including understanding complex human emotions and the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in these interactions. Overall, it emphasizes the potential of embodied AI to create meaningful connections while acknowledging the technological hurdles that still need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the company had any sort of ethics at all, they would release a patch that let you point it another LLM so you could at least keep it running.  Or release their software as open source.Or just do something so that they don't just "die".Another example on the long list of "there should be a law that you have to open source your server if you're shutting down a server based service".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the premise of the short story 'The lifecycle of software objects' by Ted Chiang. In that story the employees of the company take it upon themselves to maintain their human-like pets.

If your language model runs on the device, your cloud inference costs go to zero and the device works as long as it has power.Aside from the financial benefits, there’s a huge privacy upside as well since no audio or text is sent over a wire. Might be notable for a children’s toy.Of course, this is very difficult for large companies and VC-backed startups to care about because 1) it involves hard technical problems rather than API calls and 2) as long as you can keep asking for money the inference costs don’t matter and 3) there are no criminal consequences (prison time) for privacy violations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42370826</guid></item><item><title>50.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the development and features of Redis, an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It highlights the performance benefits of Redis, its versatility in handling various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, and its capabilities for high availability and scalability. The author reflects on the experience of building and maintaining Redis, emphasizing its impact on the software community and its widespread adoption in various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For me, the license change upset me mainly for two reasons:1. Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc - and when they did that it was under the understanding that project would remain under the same open source license. It honestly felt like a betrayal of trust.2. From a purely selfish point of view, my favourite thing about open source licenses is that they let me know exactly what I'm allowed to do and build on that software without having to consult a license. Licenses like the new Redis one leave me potentially needing to get my own legal advice depending on what I'm building on the software. I don't want to spend my time, energy or money on that stuff!I do also see these kinds of license trends as harmful to open source generally. It used to be that you could pick an open source project and build a business on it and expect that the project would stay available to you under those well understood terms. That's not the case any more - not just because of Redis, there are a number of other high-profile license rug-pulling projects. I'm sad about that.(And yes, I do understand and dislike the trend of businesses building on open source without contributing back. There are no clearly correct answers here.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; However, during the “writing years” (I’m still writing, by the way), I often returned to coding, as a way to take breaks from intense writing sessions (writing is the only mental activity I found to be a great deal more taxing than coding)This has been my experience too. With both "Game Programming Patterns" and "Crafting Interpreters", writing the code was a joy while writing the prose was hard work. Gratifying, but mentally draining in a way that programming isn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm really interested in this bit: "the fracture with the community is not about licensing, or at least it’s not mainly about licensing"I wish he'd elaborated a bit more on what he thought it was about.  My understanding is that it's 100% about the license.  That's certainly why I'll reach for valkey instead of redis next time I need it.  That's also what I've heard from everyone else in a similar position.  What else would the community split be about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378488</guid></item><item><title>2.

&lt;p&gt;In the blog post, Scott Aaronson discusses the implications of an open letter advocating for a pause on the development of advanced AI systems, reflecting on the concerns raised regarding safety, ethics, and the unknown consequences of AI progress. He addresses the potential for misuse of AI technologies and the importance of establishing guidelines and regulations to ensure responsible development. Aaronson emphasizes the need for ongoing dialogue among researchers, policymakers, and the public to navigate the challenges posed by rapidly advancing AI capabilities while fostering innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Man, reading this makes me feel so small. Being a "software engineer" consuming APIs and updating database rows seems laughably childish compared to whatever the hell it is I just read. I can't even imagine why I should bother trying to understand it. It's completely inaccessible. Only an elite few get to touch these machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem it solved would take a septillion years to do on a conventional computer but no one other than a quantum researcher cares about that problem.How about solving a problem someone that’s not a quantum researcher would care about. Give me traveling salesmen with n=10. Or factor a 10 digit number. Something.Until then quantum computers are in the same category as commercial fusion. Long on “breakthroughs”, zero on results.Look at cancer researchers for a nice contrast. The annual number of “breakthrough that could cure cancer!1!” announcements have dropped to near zero while steady, real progress is being made all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In simple terms, if I understand quantum computing, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the big benefit is parallel computing at a massive scale whereas classical computing is serial in nature. If yes likely both method are useful. But a very useful use case for quantum computing is AI training to create the models. Currently consumes a lot of GPUs but QC has nice chance to impact such a use case. Did I get it right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378407</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the phenomenon of debanking, where financial institutions sever ties with customers, particularly affecting those in the crypto and cannabis sectors. It explores the reasons behind these decisions, such as regulatory pressures and risk management, while also highlighting the implications for individuals and businesses. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for transparency and fair treatment in banking practices, advocating for more accessible financial services that cater to diverse needs without discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42371476"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This bit is downright scary: "the bank cannot explain why SARs [Suspicious activity reports] triggered a debanking, because disclosing the existence of a SAR is illegal. 12 CFR 21.11(k) Yes, it is the law in the United States that a private non-court, in possession of a memo written by a non-intelligence analyst, cannot describe the nature of the non-accusation the memo makes. Nor can it confirm or deny the existence of the memo."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I got the gist of it right, but not willing to go a second time.This was specifically about banks and their regulation, and I think it misses the more vague and less accurate sense that financial institutions can remove players and customers from the market basically at will, which would be the reason given by people going to crypto IMHO.To his point it doesn't fit "debanking", but if tomorrow VISA and Mastercard decide your online business is stinky, holding a bank account won't help you in any useful way.That's basically what happened with Porn, where even if you had a very tightly managed and stricly lawful business (let's say you produce clay stop motion porn movies), you'd still be kicked off payment platforms.Sure there can also be interesting discussions about actual bank account closures, but I think it's a lot more of a minority, there's better recourses, and most decent countries will be willing to guarantee citizens can get some form of banking whatever their situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t think anything was truly debunked here. Debanking is indeed a side-effect of AML laws and regulators, but as the article highlights, these laws are largely ineffective at stopping actual money launderers. Meanwhile, the vast majority of debanked customers are innocent. AML laws should be repealed entirely. Law enforcement should do their job and investigate crimes, rather than outsourcing this responsibility to financial institutions and effectively forcing them to be the "judge, jury, and executioner."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42371476</guid></item><item><title>5.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ummm, have y'all thought about spread costs?If you look at the spread of any of these ETF's mentioned (spread = ask px - bid px), you will notice that the spread is much smaller than if you were to sum up the spreads of each component stock.That's possible because of a mature ecosystem of ETF market makers and arbitrageurs (like Jane Street).If you buy all of the stocks individually, as it sounds like y'all's solution does, you will pay the spread cost for every. single. stock. The magnitude of these costs are not huge, but if we're comparing them against VOO's 17 bps/yr expense ratio, it's worth quantifying them.I imagine eventually you can hope that market makers will be able to quote a tight spread on whatever the basket of stocks a client wants, but in the meantime, users would be bleeding money to these costs.(Source: I work in market making and think about spreads more than I would like to admit.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're coming into a market where most providers make much more money, and you're undercutting and selling for $1/month. $1/month is below even most cheap B2C services, and many customers are likely to want a product like this to manage a large number of assets.With what other product, service, arbitrage, float, or other mechanism do you intend to make more substantial amounts of money? Knowing what this is would help potential users trust you more. "Ah, that model makes sense" is a more comfortable reaction than "I'm skeptical that this will continue to exist as a going concern that meets anyone's expectations".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I saw the "Your Money is Secure" section, but after things like the Synapse fiasco, I would like to get confirmation from you.It says my money would be SIPC insured, which means if anything goes missing (obviously not through loss of equity value, but through missing funds or a ledger bug), I get my money back, up to the SIPC limit, right? I just want to ensure this isn't the same situation with fintechs that say your money is "FDIC insured", but that only protects you if the bank fails, not if the fintech goes bankrupt.I'm just really, really wary of new fintech products to save like .3% on fees when I hear all these horror stories of people trusting fintech startups with their money any then losing 95% of their deposits like the Yotta customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377018</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the concept of a fish-eye lens and its applications in photography. It explains how this type of lens creates a wide panoramic or hemispherical image by distorting the perspective, which can lead to creative and unique visual effects. The author reflects on the aesthetic qualities of images produced with fish-eye lenses, their uses in various settings, and shares personal insights on the captivating nature of such photography.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the among the loveliest sites I've read in a long time! &lt;3Beautifully designed, executed and presented. With just enough tension to pull the reader in...I had to look up the author (who I was not familiar with, tbh) and her other work. Good job!Beautifully done. 12/10, would read again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My cursor got schooled.Intriguing example with the shoemaker story, but initially confusing.  After playing with it, okay, but still perhaps more confusing than the concept which is clear.The trick with the cursor suggests: what if the context was ambient, like a graph of concept bubbles around whatever paragraph has focus?  Or, a step further, as if the paragraph was a card in an array of cards swiped across a desk in "is this your card?" style, with fisheye focus on paragraph text, past and future paragraphs as cards to left and right of this one, with summarized concepts bracketing those from above and below?In any case, this is onto something, and worth experimenting with various UIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea who the author is but that was the most beautiful blog

&lt;p&gt;The article explores a novel approach to cooperative reinforcement learning (CRL) by introducing a decentralized algorithm that enhances communication among agents. It presents a framework called Communication-Enhanced Decentralized Mean-Field Q-Learning (CEDM-Q), which integrates mean-field theory to improve scalability and efficiency in multi-agent environments. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CEDM-Q through various experiments where it outperforms traditional CRL methods in terms of convergence rates and overall performance in complex tasks, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in domains such as robotics and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been looking into using the last hidden layer of an off-the-shelf LLM to help my company with a classification task. The last hidden layer is obviously super rich in semantic information because it has to somehow tell the next layer how to generate the next token prediction. That final layer, in some respects, is discarding valuable context information that the final hidden layer encodes.I am not surprised at all that Meta was able to generate some positive returns by feeding the last hidden layer back into the model auto-regressively.The method of training they describe in the paper is really cool. Summarized in Figure 2, they train it with a corpus of step-by-step text instructions and then across multiple stages, they iteratively replace one of the textual steps with a last-hidden-layer embedding and see what the model spits out. The weights are then updated through cross-entropy loss as the additional text tokens are generated once again.So they're basically rewinding the output, replacing an increasing number of textual steps with hidden state embeddings, and playing it forward as the model gradually learns to do all of its step-by-step thinking using just the hidden state data.In a way, this might be how humans learn to think through language. Our parents teach us using words and our brain gradually replaces the words with thoughts until we can replicate the action or solve the problem ourselves without anyone guiding us with words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We conducted similar research earlier and successfully improved performance to a level comparable to models with 3x larger layer sizes. https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14199v3  We utilize more computational time in the latent space to achieve better performance. However, this approach introduces greater resistance compared to Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning in the token space, especially if the number of CoT rounds in the latent space exceeds 20.
I would using the term "better approximation of the data distribution" instead of "reasoning" to describe this kind of process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel abdominal pain when I see the words “thinking” or “reasoning” related to LLMs.I feel back pain when I read the crazy, unsound speculation about how the brain is supposed to be like a computer. Serious mistake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378335</guid></item><item><title>8.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Depths of Wikipedians" explores the intricate and diverse community of Wikipedia contributors, known as Wikipedians. It delves into their motivations, backgrounds, and the collaborative nature of their work, highlighting the challenges and rewards associated with editing and maintaining the world's largest online encyclopedia. The piece also examines the social dynamics within the community, including both positive interactions and conflicts, while reflecting on the impact of these contributors on the accuracy and reliability of information available on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; that's the unfortunate thing about growing and becoming a massive encyclopedia that's more respected than it was in 2004Is it?  Wikipedia was massive and respected in 2014, too, but it wasn't dominated by the problems discussed immediately beforehand—WP:BRD didn't neuter WP:BOLD, and egoists with "standing" didn't have free reign to antagonize newcomers who followed the rules.The problem with Wikipedia and other WMF projects nowadays is the entrenched folks with standing not being subject to rules and being permitted to apply new ones pulled out of thin air, not to mention the insidious circling-of-the-wagons when they're challenged and comrades come to their defense by trying to attack and smear the perceived threat.In a well-ordered and functioning society you can avoid running afoul of the law by following the rules—you can get by without having to pay speeding tickets by simply not speeding.  Wikipedia and other WMF projects that have been infected by Wikipedia admins and their toxic mindset are more like a society where impunity might as well be codified—like a cop who says, "It's like this because I say so."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been editing Wikipedia literally for decades and I'm astonished at the vitriol in these comments.  Would any HNers care to share any examples of actual articles that showcase this "extreme ideological slant"?Yes, editing Wikipedia is harder than it needs to be and you better have your Kevlar underwear on before venturing into hot potato topics, but there's a lot more to Wikipedia than that and contributions to more obscure/factual articles are generally more than welcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; that's the unfortunate thing about growing and becoming a massive encyclopedia that's more respected than it was in 2004In the very few areas where I am well read or even an expert, the Wiki articles I read horrify me.  I consider them wholly misleading and improper.  As such, I do not read Wiki articles on anything subjective (history, people, etc) because such articles of this type I am in a position to judge, I judge very poorly indeed, so I have reason to think all articles of these types are no good, at all.For some classes of articles, such as math or computer science concepts, I find all Wiki articles utterly hopeless - the explanations only make sense to someone who already understands.I'm conscious also of the massive propaganda efforts being exerted by various entities on various pages, such as, for example, the Ukraine War, or the Russian Government.This leaves the balance, articles on simple, fairly non-subjective and uncontrovertial subjects, and they seem okay.It's not great, and when I really do need to know about something, I consult an actual, curated, non-mass-edited encyclopedia.Also, many years ago, I used to edit/contribute, but that stopped, because it became increasingly difficult and unpleasant due to other editors, and in any event, anything you added sooner or later would be removed or edited away, one way or another.Oh and then have the Foundation, doing it's voodoo-idiocy in the background, such as the amazing new editor which no one wants or likes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377770</guid></item><item><title>9.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the significance and use of color in the Middle Ages, emphasizing how it influenced art, fashion, and societal status. It highlights the symbolism associated with different colors and how they were perceived culturally and religiously. The piece explores the availability of dyes, the impact of wealth on color choices, and how color was used to convey messages and identities during that period. Overall, it aims to reveal the rich and nuanced role of color in medieval life, which is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Michel Pastoureau’s book on blue begins by highlighting the neglect this colour faced among the ancient Greeks and Romans, who rarely wrote about it or used it. He even explores the intriguing question of whether ancient peoples could perceive blue at all!The first synthetic pigment was calcium copper silicate or Egyptian Blue [1], so called because the Egyptians manufactured it from at least the fourth millennium BC; from the Egyptians, the rest of the Mediterranean learned to make and use this artificial pigment, so that it is widely attested in art from the Minoans, Mycenaeans, Greeks (if distinguishable from the Mycenaeans), Romans, and so forth up until the middle ages.  Given that Egyptian Blue is a synthetic pigment that must be manufactured by human skill and ingenuity, it boggles the mind that people keep falling for this idea that ancient peoples could not perceive blue.  I have no idea how someone could write a book suggesting that ancient people did not write about (Plato certainly did) or use a color that they in fact synthesized, manufactured, and used in art.  The ancient Greek word for the color is κυανοῦς, the Latin caeruleus (but of the eyes, caesius).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thing I find fascinating is how crass many medieval objects and garments are colored, often to the point they are offensive to our modern tastes. Our fiction depicts the Middle Ages as a mix of gray and earth tones, but reality is the opposite: people in the Middle Ages loved colors (just as the people before them). It's the wide availability of synthetic colors that lead to us using them less and less in modern times, preferring everything to be muted, gray or colored in black, off-white and earth tones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My favorite fun fact about the colors monk's habits is that The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a branch of the Franciscans are at the root of the words cappuccino and capuchin monkey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377644</guid></item><item><title>10.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the declining math scores of U.S. students as revealed by the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). It highlights that U.S. fourth-graders scored lower compared to their peers from previous assessments, indicating a significant post-pandemic impact on educational achievement. The piece emphasizes concerns over long-term educational implications, the disparities in performance among different student demographics, and the urgent need for interventions to address these declines in math learning and overall academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The report: https://timss2023.org/results/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the test collect any data on the demographics of the takers, so that we can check whether the drop is within-group, or whether it’s just artifact of changing composition? For all we know, this might be just a case of Simpson paradox, where each subgroup actually improved, but the overall score distribution shifted downwards due to school children population growing more and more immigrant, after years of mass immigration. While US has excellent education, and immigrant children in America do better than their counterparts in their countries of origin, they don’t do as well as the modal group of white Americans, so as the composition changes, and the whites become less of a statistically dominating factor, the scores are expected to go down, even as the education quality improves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It used to pain me that the US education system had such a low standard on math. Like in the 7th-grade textbook Common Core Advanced, students are asked to "show that 3(x+2) = 3X + 6", and the answer is to use a f&amp;*@ing table that lists a few actual calculations. And my kid's homework on pre-algebra is something like calculating "-1 - (-5)". Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there's problem if every problem is as simple as that.But then over the years, I realized that Americans simply didn't think math is that important to everyone, as the meme illustrates: https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pd6hhc...So, the high schools by default just teach the very basics: some calculation, some definitions, and etc. Those who want to go deeper have to push themselves. I guess nothing is wrong with this approach, as indeed only a small percentage of people would use maths harder than Common Core day in and day out. On the other hand, I do feel a lot of ordinary kids would miss out - they could be come decent engineers, if someone pushed them or showed them the way when they grew up in high school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378929</guid></item><item><title>12.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;&gt; Since graduating from undergraduate studies (which marks exactly one year as I write this post)Author sounds young .. yes, absolutely try to consume less and create more, it's way more life-affirming than the opposite configuration, but:Getting better at your job, like everything else in life, is just a function of time. Show up, and then show up consistently. Put in the time. Be patient. Lead with an open mind and an open heart -- opportunities go to those who are present way more often than those who aren't. Willingly take on shitty jobs, do them well, and you'll find yourself being trusted with bigger and better jobs. Learn when to be the worker bee and when to be the queen bee. Say "yes" until you're truly able to say "no". Try to accept that, at the end of the day, things don't matter as much as you think they might -- I'm talking about projects, stress, deadlines, shit that floods your veins with cortisol. The only thing people will truly remember is how you made them feel during a crisis, not the minutiae of what you actually contributed -- and those personal relationships will be the gasoline in the engine of your career.I really believe people will go far if they focus on this kind of stuff, and way less on structured self-improvement, productivity hacking, finding "secrets", shortcuts via programs, seminars, coaches, and tools, and all that shallow, nutritionless baloney.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This post makes a few detours, but the section about their own work is always interesting to me. I've always been a "pull on the threads and then pattern match"-kinda worker, rather than a "productivity-chaser" or "advice-seeker". I just pull on the threads that interest me, and over time these threads always have a way of coming back together. It's the difference between being goal oriented and process oriented. This is a much slower, much longer arc to building your taste, skills, and reaching some semblance of your abstract goals, but the other way just wasn't fun to me.When I was in undergrad I remember reading a lot of blogs and hoping to live up to their idealistic views (shoutout pg), because I hadn't quite yet identified what career I wanted to lead. I dropped out, and then around 24/25 the desire for those goals really shattered. I pursued a very self-directed path that has thankfully worked out (so far-still ample time for it to falter). As this post points out, the only advice that is universal on the internet is that there is no universal advice. Find what rings true to you and lean into it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a fantastic essay. Long ago I had the same hunch and likened having the internet around me to running with a parachute.These days I am little better at avoiding consumption, if not worse. I think it's inevitable. And I think on net it may be a good thing. Yes you lose time and focus by dipping your toes into the zeitgeist, but you also make sure you work on things that are relevant. The open vs closed door from Hamming's You and Your Research.The closed-door researcher produces more work, but the open-door researcher produces impactful work. Who was ultimately more productive?The key, I find, is to do a bit of both. Work on hard things with deep focus and validate against the zeitgeist regularly.edit: Found it. Almost the exact same post (in gist) from 2011 when I was 24, similar age as OP. https://swizec.com/blog/my-ideas-are-shitty-so-im-going-on-a...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42379970</guid></item><item><title>13.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open source projects like Relisten [1] depend on the Internet Archive for long term storage of legally recorded concerts from artists like the Grateful Dead, known for their unique concert experiences. This is an invaluable public service for millions of music fans and a boon to American history and culture.[1] https://relisten.net&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The entire copyright thing needs to stop. It is preventing great music from being made or at least released publicly.I understand that some musicians get nice royalties and this is their full-time thing, but most of us get close to nothing from streaming and barely break even from record sales.I'd rather get nothing and be allowed to sample and remix everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something I don't think anyone has thought of.The conventional idea is a band makes a CD of their songs, mastered to perfection, stamps out CDs and streams, and that's it. The exact same audio, let's call it the "radio edit". I hear the song on the radio, it's exactly the same. I can tell when a performer is lip syncing, because no singer sings a song the same way twice, and I know the radio edit. It's burned in my brain.But, I discovered that when real bands, like Fleetwood Mac, play a concert, they play their old standards, but in a different way every time. I bought their concert CDs, because hearing different versions of the same song makes it fresh and fun again.So my idea is, why don't bands produce a dozen or so "radio edits" of their better songs? I bet they'd increase sales, especially to people like me.I suppose they think they are doing that with the "remastered" edits, but those all stink. Sing it again, Sam!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42373098</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article traces the history of Central Processing Units (CPUs) from their early beginnings in the 1940s with the ENIAC and UNIVAC to contemporary advancements in multi-core processors and microarchitectures. It highlights significant milestones, influential figures in computing, and the evolution of processor design and technology, emphasizing how developments in CPU architecture have driven improvements in computing power and efficiency. The piece also discusses various generations of CPUs, their increasing complexity, and the impact they have had on both hardware and software evolution in the computing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would've expected some information on the architecture, maybe even a simulator. That should surely already have existed before any working hardware?Let's try to make sense of that code shown:        ...
        jsr     println
        anyi    r3 r0 #1324
        jsr     println
        anyi    r3 r0 #1412
        jsr     println
        hlt

r0 appears to be the zero register, "anyi" combines that with an immediate to load a pointer to the string to print into r3. The immediate field is 12 trits, so we have a maximum address range of 531441 (trytes?)The encoding for the "jsr println" is always the same, so it's using absolute addresses, range is 3^20 or slightly less than 3.5G. Or would be if we were allowing negative addresses, since it appears to be balanced ternary (+--+00 = 144 decimal)Next bit of code is println, the address matches the one from jsr.    println:
        ld      r2 0(r3)                ;get char
        jeq     r2 r0 exit_println      ;exit if nul
        out     50(r0) r2               ;output to console0?
        out     60(r0) r2               ;output to console1?
        addi    r3 r3 #4                ;next char - why add 4?
        jmp     println                 ;loop

    exit_println:
        anyi    r4 r0 #10               ;ASCII LF
        out     60(r0) r4               ;output to console1?
        anyi    r4 r0 #13               ;ASCII CR
        out     60(r0) r4               ;output to console1?
        jr      r26                     ;return (r26 = link register set by jsr)

I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a word-addressed machine. Or would be better if it actually was. The addressing unit appears to be 6-trit "trytes", but loads only work when aligned to 4? Which seems a bit (no pun intended) inconvenient for a ternary computer! Is there no "load tryte" instruction?Jump instructions are encoded relative to the next instruction, with a 12-trit immediate. Seems fine, but a bit inconsistent with how jsr uses absolute addresses. Also again every instruction is 4 trytes, so we could drop the low bits and shift... ah, I'm forgetting that it's ternary, never mind.Separate I/O space, seems a bit un-RISCy. I personally happen to like x86, but even there it's considered a legacy feature nowadays.---This may sound harsh, but to me the architecture looks both fairly conventional, and at the same time like a bit of a mess, which would be fine for a hobby project, but not for something with a website making grandiose claims and clearly intending to be a commercial product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very cool to see that you've achieved a hardware prototype. Looks great.If you're more interested in exploring your ideas about ternary dataflow computing, is there a reason you didn't start with an FPGA instead? The gap between idea and prototype is much smaller and there's even dataflow DSLs like Tapa if you don't want to write the HDL:https://github.com/rapidstream-org/rapidstream-tapa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super cool.With the recent paper that apparently shows that ternary data used for AI can be faster and more energy efficient, I am intrigued that someone is experimenting with ternary in hardware.I am a layman — can a conventional computer architecture be taken and ternary data and instructions grafted on to it? Or does the whole architecture need to be rebuilt from the ground up?I guess I don't see, for example, any advantage to ternary addressing, only ternary data and operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42368872</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article addresses common misconceptions about compilers, clarifying their functions and processes. It emphasizes that compilers do not simply translate source code into machine code; they also perform various optimizations and checks for errors. Additionally, it explains the importance of understanding different phases of compilation, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The piece aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of how compilers operate and their critical role in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; As an example, in my desktop, it takes ~25min to compile a Debug version of LLVM, but ~23min to compile a Release version.oh I think I know what might cause this: TableGen. The `llvm-tblgen` run time accounts for a good chunk of LLVM build time. In a debug build `llvm-tblgen` is also  unoptimized, hence the long run time generating those .inc / .def files. You can enable cmake variable `LLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN` to build `llvm-tblgen` in release mode while leaving the rest of the project in debug build (or whatever `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` you choose).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; The compiler optimizes for data locality&gt; So, we have a single array in which every entry has the key and the value paired together. But, during lookups, we only care about the keys. The way the data is structured, we keep loading the values into the cache, wasting cache space and cycles. One way to improve that is to split this into two arrays: one for the keys and one for the values.Recently someone proposed this on LLVM: https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-add-a-new-structure-layout-...Also, I think what you meant by data locality here is really optimizing data layout, which, as you also mentioned, is a hard problem. But if it's just optimizing (cache's) locality, I think the classic loop interchange also qualifies. Though it's not enabled by default in LLVM, despite being there for quite a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About C/C++ compilers, mostly.C++ has terrible template and include compilation problems, for historical reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42372617</guid></item><item><title>17.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the implementation of durable workflows in PostgreSQL using Supabase's functionalities. It explains how to handle complex workflows by leveraging PostgreSQL's capabilities to maintain state and manage long-running tasks. Key concepts such as the use of database records to track workflow state, the advantages of reliability and persistence, and the ability to integrate with Supabase's real-time features are highlighted. The post emphasizes practical applications of durable workflows and provides insights on how developers can utilize these features effectively for building scalable applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; DBOS has a special @DBOS.Transaction decorator. This runs the entire step inside a Postgres transaction. This guarantees exactly-once execution for databases transactional steps.I stopped here. I know, authors really want to chase the exactly-once dragon, but this won't scale. If the step takes a long time, it'll keep the transaction open with it for that time. The master replica has to bookkeeping that. That state has to be replicated. That will also affect MVVC further on. As your scale grows, you'll see disk usage growing and eventually swapping, replica lags, AND vacuum halting for surges. I hope your uncalled engineers have a steady supply of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is important to note that employing any workflow engine needs careful examination of the benefits vs. drawbacks.You will need full and complete control over workflow orchestration, restarts, deletes, logging, versioning etc.Your steps will get stuck, they will error out unexpectedly and you will need complete transparency and operational tools to deal with that.In many cases you will be better off doing the book-keeping yourself. A process should be defined in terms of your domain data. Typically you have statuses (not the best choice, but I digress) that change over time, so you can report on the whole lifecycle of your shopping cart.Now, and this is crucial, how you implement state changes - any state change - should exactly be the same for a "workflow" than for a non-workflow! It needs to be.
A shipment is either not ready yet or done - this information should not be in a "workflow state".Let's say you shut down your system and start it back up: do you have a mechanism in place that can "continue where it 
left off"? If so, you likely don't need a workflow engine.In our case, on startup, we need to query the system for carts that are waiting for shipments and that are not being dealt with yet.
Then fan out tasks for those.That is robust in the face of changed data. If you employ a workflow engine, changed data always needs to two consider two worlds: your own domain data and any book-keeping that is potentially done in any workflow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of Hatchet (https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet), which is a Postgres-backed task queue that supports durable execution.&gt; Because a step transition is just a Postgres write (~1ms) versus an async dispatch from an external orchestrator (~100ms), it means DBOS is 25x faster than AWS Step FunctionsDurable execution engines deployed as an external orchestrator will always been slower than direct DB writes, but the 1ms delay versus ~100ms doesn't seem inherent to the orchestrator being external. In the case of Hatchet, pushing work takes ~15ms and invoking the work takes ~1ms if deployed in the same VPC, and 90% of that execution time is on the database. In the best-case, the external orchestrator should take 2x as long to write a step transition (round-trip network call to the orchestrator + database write), so an ideal external orchestrator would be ~2ms of latency here.There are also some tradeoffs to a library-only mode that aren't discussed. How would work that requires global coordination between workers behave in this model? Let's say, for example, a global rate limit -- you'd ideally want to avoid contention on rate limit rows, assuming they're stored in Postgres, but each worker attempting to acquire a rate limit simultaneously would slow down start time significantly (and place additional load on the DB). Whereas with a single external orchestrator (or leader election), you can significantly increase throughput by acquiring rate limits as part of a push-based assignment process.The same problem of coordination arises if many workers are competing for the same work --  for example if a machine crashes while doing work, as described in the article. I'm assuming there's some kind of polling happening which uses FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, which concerns me as you start to scale up the number of workers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42379974</guid></item><item><title>19.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the influence of environmental factors on public health, emphasizing the importance of understanding the complex interactions between ecosystems and human health. It highlights how climate change, pollution, and urbanization can affect disease patterns and health outcomes. The authors advocate for interdisciplinary approaches to research and policy-making to address these challenges, underscoring the need for collaboration among public health professionals, environmental scientists, and policymakers to create effective strategies that promote healthier environments and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've spent some time living in Sweden and I think there's a number of important details here that are not sufficiently highlighted that can radically change how to interpret the results. Swedes have a tradition of eating candy once a week on Saturdays. It's incredibly common for them to not have candy all week, then go buy an assortment bag on Saturday, eat it all, and then not have any again for a week. We don't know how this affects health outcomes compared to say, having a bit of candy every day, the glycemic load profiles will be widely different and we don't know if that matters or not.Fika, a coffee break with pastries, is a very strong cultural phenomenon. The pastries Swedes have are generally of very high quality and many of them also contain a considerable amount of fat, which as we know, helps buffer glycemic load. While it's mentioned in the study in passing, I think it should instead be one of the core focus points, it's hard to assess the effect of this as opposed to plain added sugar.And lastly, Swedes are very outdoorsy people. On any day of the week, you can see people strolling on nature trails, of which there are plenty, and spending a lot of time active in general. I would not be surprised if a large part of the health outcomes we see in statistics can be attributed to variance in this.So to summarize, while these results are interesting, I think there are too many hidden influences here that are not controlled for to really generalize these results in any way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; High intake of sweetened beverages was associated with higher risk for most of the studied outcomes, for which positive linear associations were found. In contrast, a low intake of treats was associated with a higher risk of all the studied outcomes.Not sure what to make of this -- some kind of other latent explanation (e.g. that many of those with the lowest intake of treats were on a diet due to bad health?).From the discussion section:&gt; One aspect to take into consideration is however that there is a social tradition of “fika” in Sweden, where people get together with friends, relatives, or coworkers for coffee and pastries (41). Thus, one could hypothesize that the intake of treats is part of many people's everyday lives without necessarily being related with overall poor dietary or lifestyle patterns, and that it might be a marker of social life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the best things I did for my diet was to try to rein in all of the places that sugar was snuck into my diet so when I want to get a candy bar or a soda I can not feel bad about it.My best example of this is peanut butter. I love peanut butter but started making my own with just dry roasted unsalted peanuts and a small amount of salt.Still enjoyed the things I wanted and fully sustainable. Didn’t actually eliminate anything and no “cheat” days.Somewhat recently I had a PB craving so I got a jar. Was shocked at how sweet it was.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42372379</guid></item><item><title>20.

&lt;p&gt;The article recounts the life of John Kinsel, a gifted linguist and master of deception who created his own language to manipulate Japanese authorities and evade capture during a significant period in his life. Kinsel’s unique linguistic abilities allowed him to successfully navigate various situations, ultimately leading to his controversial yet intriguing legacy. The obituary highlights his complex character and the implications of his actions on broader cultural and social dynamics, illustrating how his life story reflects themes of identity, communication, and the power of language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website provides an interactive visualization of B+ Trees, a type of self-balancing tree data structure used in databases and file systems. It explains the fundamental concepts, properties, and operations of B+ Trees, including insertion, deletion, and searching. Users can manipulate the tree through a graphical interface to see how these operations affect the structure in real-time, enhancing understanding of how B+ Trees maintain balance and optimize data retrieval. The site serves as an educational tool for those learning about data structures and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boltzmann brain is a thought experiment in philosophy and theoretical physics that explores the implications of entropy and statistical mechanics. It suggests that, in an infinite universe or a sufficiently long time scale, random fluctuations could create self-aware entities, known as Boltzmann brains, from a sea of chaos. This concept raises questions about the nature of reality, observation, and the anthropic principle, challenging the stability of our understanding of the universe and whether complex structures like humans or brains are more likely to arise than simple spontaneous fluctuations. The idea highlights the paradoxes involved in discussions of cosmology, thermodynamics, and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42374027"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Over a sufficiently long time, random fluctuations could cause particles to spontaneously form literally any structure of any degree of complexity, including a functioning human brainCan anyone explain this bit to me? The formation of biological brains was a multi-billion year climb against entropy. How would a brain form spontaneously without those random fluctuations tearing the constituent components apart?I’m having trouble understanding the logic here. Random fluctuations don’t imply that any order from those fluctuations can be preserved. The higher order features like brains are path dependent on something resisting those random fluctuations to allow something stable to form, whether that’s an atomic particle, cell, organ, or organism.IANAP and I don’t know what I’m talking about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a widely circulated (amongst philosophers) argument against the Boltzmann brain hypothesis made on bayesian grounds. Technical, but very interesting. It's being published next year in what's generally regarded as the top academic journal for philosophy: https://philpapers.org/archive/DOGWIA-6.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problem with the Boltzmann brain, and the reason you’re almost certainly not one, is that if you are one then your senses have no relation to reality - including the part of reality where you read about the Boltzmann brain concept, or any measurements you can make about the underlying reality that makes you think you could be one.This is the same with all solipsistic arguments, like simulation hypothesis. If the universe is, in fact, an illusion, then how do you truly know anything about the real world? Sure it could be a computer simulation, but there’s no way to know for sure. The parent universe could actually follow different laws entirely. It could be creating a ”simulation” through entirely different methods. Hell, for all you know it could be an evil demon using magic to trick us, because magic could be real in the parent universe. It’s all unfalsifiable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42374027</guid></item><item><title>23.

If the runtime isn't NUMA-aware, it will wind up with cross-die continuations of logical work, increasing latency and burning up interconnect bandwidth. Even if it is aware of the architecture, you still have a messy, non-obvious situation to resolve regarding whether or not to take the latency impact.Managing your own threads and always assuming the worst case scenario (I.e., they're all a microsecond away from each other) will give you the most defensive solution as architecture changes over time.I really don't know the best answer. Another NUMA node implies some necessary additional complexity. It would seem the wonder of 192 cores in a socket has some tradeoffs the software people need to compensate for now. You can't get all that magic for free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in 1997, if you brought a Pentium 2 [1] you didn't just get a single chip with all the cache made by the same process. Instead, the chip and the cache were made by different processes, tested, then integrated into a 'cartridge' you plugged into the 'CPU slot'[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42371221</guid></item><item><title>24.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla Firefox has decided to remove support for the "Do Not Track" feature, which allows users to signal their privacy preferences to websites. This decision stems from the recognition that the feature was largely ineffective, as many websites ignored it. The article discusses the implications of this change for user privacy, noting that without this feature, users will need to rely more on other privacy tools and settings within the browser. It also highlights the ongoing challenges in online privacy and the importance of being proactive in protecting personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377159"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was at Mozilla when this was implemented.It was completely optional for websites to support this. A few did at first.A lot of people internally wanted it to be on-by-default, but the argument was that if it was, nobody would respect it – after all, what tracking platform would willingly only track the 0.1% of people who went into the settings to enable it? (Internet Explorer did eventually enable it by default, which got them good press but ultimately killed the feature since everyone stopped respecting it.)Overall, I'm happy to see this sunsetted. I don't think it actually did anything – in fact, I think it implies that it did way more than it did, so it was just a faux feeling of security.(All that being said, I would love if the cookie modals on each site became browser-level, but I'm sure there's many reasons that hasn't happened yet. And I suspect a bit reason starts with a G and ends with an Oogle.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I understand that many people here have a bad taste of Mozilla's recent actions in many aspects. But the reality here is that this is at worst removing something that almost nobody respected. It was based on honor system and even in Switzerland they do have random inspections for honor system. Browsers never had any enforcement of this feature. And ironically it was used as additional data point of tracking privacy aware people who went out of the way to enable it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removing this feature harms user agency. This will result in Firefox users having to deal with more annoying consent prompts.Transcend Consent Management's default configuration opts users out of every unessential tracking purpose (and suppresses automatic consent prompts) whenever DNT is enabled, but only opts users out of "Sale/sharing of info" when only GPC is enabled.Removing this centralized privacy signal means some users cannot express full opt outs to Transcend Consent Management by default without having to interact with annoying banners.I believe this change was steamrolled without taking in proper consideration and feedback from the web community. Mozilla made this change so fast that barely anyone noticed the issue before it got closed[1]. To add insult to injury, they've
configured their Bugzilla to disallow further comments from non-Mozilla employees after issues are closed.I shared similar feedback with the Chrome team in 2023 when they were proposing to remove DNT[2]. They considered my feedback and currently DNT is still in Chrome, with its removal indefinitely postponed.1. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19280872. https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41440843#comment12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377159</guid></item><item><title>25.

It requires some patience but after getting used to it, the experience is surprisingly pleasant especially if you're familiar with terminal-based tools. My environment consists of:  - Galaxy S24 Ultra
  - Termius: I think it is the best terminal emulator and SSH client on Android. The sad thing is that the paid version is a bit too expensive. ($10 per month, no permanent option)
  - tmux: Mobile connections are brittle so it is a must.
  - Vim: Allows me to navigate the code freely without using arrow keys, which is really useful on the touch keyboard.

Not that of a big deal, but the thing that I think is more pleasant on the phone than on the PC is that I can use my fingerprint to log in to the remote server. The fingerprint is stored in the TPM so it is safe. It feels magical!Edit: The biggest pain point for me was the limited width of the smartphone screen. It is a bit hard to skim over the code quickly because most lines are severely cut. Text wrapping helps this but personally I hate text wrapping. Keeping landscape mode is not an option because the code area is completely hidden when the touch keyboard is displayed. That's why foldable phones are great for coding, as they have a wider screen. My previous phone was Galaxy Fold and it was a wonderful coding machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I been writing programs for over 50 years and I shuddered at the thought of doing it on a phone. My first thought, he must be a masochist. Then I thought he might not had anything better to work on. I'm a touch typist who doesn't need to look at the keyboard why typing. Given my cataracts and tiny screen and tiny keyboard, it is torture to type on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42374823</guid></item><item><title>26.

I wanted to learn more about deep learning, but from a systems prespective. Coming from Andrew's Ng course on supervised learning, I was eager to learn more about how deep learning frameworks (or deep learning compilers) like Pytorch or Tinygrad.I started to poke around Tinygrad, learning from the tutorials I found online, and I found it fascinating because it was an actual compiler, it took conventional python code and translated them into an Abstract Syntax Tree that was parsed into UOps and ScheduleItems, to finally have a codegen layer. While the design was interesting, the code was hard to read.That's when I stumbled across something completly unexpected, A deep learning compiler built on Common Lisp, maintained by a Japanese 18-year-old during his gap year. And currently we have acomplished something great, it can run gpt2!For now, it just generates C-kernels, but in the future we would like to support cuda codegen as well as many other features, and serve as a learning tool for anyone who would like to get to work on deep learning compilers in Common Lisp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;so what does this do? what is meant by deep learning compiler? from the given examples, Apache TVM sounds like a ML graph execution engine and model  deployment solution. ditto TinyGrad. Is Caten a Lisp ML framework?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378194</guid></item><item><title>27.

&lt;p&gt;The article features an interview with composer and educator John Schaeffer, discussing his insights on music theory, composition techniques, and the role of education in nurturing musical talent. Schaeffer shares his experiences in the music industry, emphasizing the importance of creativity and critique in developing a personal style. He also reflects on the evolution of music in contemporary society and the impact of technology on composers and performers. The interview serves to illuminate Schaeffer's philosophy on music education and its relevance in today's cultural landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In which Pierre Schaeffer admits that Musique Concrete is not music, and that he has never been a real musician. Ouch… I wonder if he knows there are internet music genres that have not only kept the ideas of Musique Concrete alive, but made them culturally relevant and musically valuable in a way that he and other 20th century “serious” musical thinkers never managed to. Some of the more obscure vaporwave subgenres are basically turntable pieces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't care one iota for trying to demarcate what is and what isn't music - IMHO just a really stupid thing to get hung up about. But the point about abstraction ("The whole problem of the sound-work [...]") in both visual and aural terms I found really interesting.Regarding the conclusion, some of the best works have been disowned by their creators at some point, so not to worry there.PS a nice sort of anthropological/sociological inside view of the IRCAM at some specific time can be read in "Rationalizing culture: IRCAM, Boulez, and the Institutionalization of the Musical Avant-Garde" by Georgina Born.By the way, isn't it quite silly to say that electronic music " emerged in Cologne in 1950 at the NWDR"? As if we wouldn't have electronic music from 1000 different places if it weren't for them...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This reminded me of Herbert's manifesto on how he makes music.https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=3890&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348799</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it would be interesting to use an LLM to distill Wikipedia into a set of assertions, then iterate through combinations of those assertions using OpenCyc.You could look for contradictions between pages on the same subject in different languages, or different pages on related subjects.You could synthesise new assertions based on what the current assertions imply, then render it to a sentence and fact-check it.You could use verified assertions to benchmark language parsing and comprehension for new models. Basically unit test NLP.You could produce a list of new assertions and implications introduced when a new edit to a page is made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Is anyone playing with the combination of generative AI and OpenCyc?OpenCyc specifically? No. But related semantic KB's using the SemanticWeb / RDF stack? Yes. That's something I'm spending a fair bit of time on right now.And given that there is an RDF encoding of a portion fof the OpenCyc data out there[1], and that may make it into some of my experiments eventually, I guess the answer is more like "Not exactly, but sort of, maybe'ish" or something.[1]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/texai/files/open-cyc-rdf/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll be the antiquated person here. Writing/speaking well has brought people to knowledge because the authors are uniquely positioned to use genius, humour, gentleness and generosity to bring an inquisitive but ignorant person into a new area of knowledge. When the value of that can be quantified, then we can compare AI "generation" of "efficiently written, useful knowledge" with what we had/have.Same for fiction, visual art, raising children, caring for old people, and so on, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42373106</guid></item><item><title>32.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses a newly discovered security vulnerability known as "BadRAM" that affects AMD's EPYC processors. This vulnerability undermines previous assurances of security in these CPUs, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate memory allocation and inject malicious code. Researchers detail how the attack works and its implications for data integrity and system security, emphasizing the need for improved security protocols in processor design to mitigate such risks in the future. The piece highlights the ongoing challenges in cybersecurity within hardware architecture and calls for heightened awareness among users and manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

CSPs are the ones to deploy the technology. I suspect their main desire is to (a) avoid the hassle of law enforcement requests, as one cannot grant access to keys one does not have and (b) allay would-be customer concerns around cloud hosting versus on-prem deployments. Maybe (c) is to support compliance and regulatory checkboxes. TEEs are not about security, rather about security liability. Academic attacks are indeed just that, and not necessarily expected to be seen in the wild or affect security posture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was there a secure enclave that determined people didn't find bugs in? I remember the modding community around old Motorola phones before Android was a thing, they obviously had a secure loader, write once memory to prevent downgrades, signed firmwares and all that, yet each and every version was bugged in one way or another. From sofisticated ones to "just keep writing despite the driver signaling error" kind of ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42381406</guid></item><item><title>34.

In 2015, Toshiba announced the first 16-die stack using through-silicon vias. That enabled higher bandwidth, reduced latency, and faster I/O, while also helping to pave the way for stacking of other types of memory and logic chips.Stacking multiple dies (with or without TSVs) is an entirely different kind of stacking from building multiple layers of memory cells on a single die, which is what 3D NAND is all about. Samsung was the first to deliver 3D NAND, and IIRC Toshiba was tied for fourth to reach that milestone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt;export rules restrict stacks of more than 128 layers. So countries subject to those restrictions get an end-around by simply stacking 128-layer modulesI'm interested in the story behind this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42359299</guid></item><item><title>35.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given the code quality and rigid testing, SQLite is probably the last project that should be rewritten. It'd be great to see all other C code rewritten first!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the initial SQLite3-&gt;LibSQL fork was announced I was pretty negative about it because SQLite3 has a wonderful, 100% branch coverage test suite that is proprietary, and so without access to that any fork would be bound to fail.However, if there's a big product behind the fork, and even better, a rewrite to a memory-safe language, then the fork begins to make a lot of sense.  So, hats off to y'all for pulling this off!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All this talk of “SQLite is not open contribution” never seems to consider that a project being “open contribution” doesn't mean the maintainers will accept your contributions.They have a process for contributions to follow: you suggest a feature, they implement it. It's far from the only project to take such a stance.Just in the SQLite “ecosystem” see the contribution policies of Litestream and LiteFS. I don't see people brandishing the ”not open contribution” to Ben's projects.https://github.com/superfly/litefs?tab=readme-ov-file#contri...https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream?tab=readme-ov-file...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378843</guid></item><item><title>38.

A relieve for devops/YAML engineers that need to reason about many key/values coming from many places. Because in the end this is all there is for the user interface of IaC/XaaS, k8s and all cloud apis.
There was some effort for "configuration management" but few realizes the complexity, the many layers and aspects there is to "it". YAML ain't mearly enough...
But the space of "configuration PLs" (Dhall,Nickel,Pkl,KCL,CUE,Jsonnet,etc.) is still young. Biggest problem I see is usability, CUE focuses on it so people shouldn't be afraid. But it is also little behind the others in term of features, but also have the greatest potential!
IMO any new tool in the cloud space that uses code abstractions cannot be serious by not thinking about the language. Transitions may be though but they ough to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We already have an existing project with a bunch of Helm charts deployed using ArgoCD. What would be the benefit of using Holos now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diagram on the front page immediately makes me question why all of this is so complex given the end goal is to run a process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42366665</guid></item><item><title>39.

Not excited about how broad this is "3.2 License: By using the Services, you hereby grant to Cognition, its affiliates, successors, and assigns a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, transferable license to reproduce, distribute, modify, and otherwise use, display, and perform all acts with respect to the Customer Data as may be necessary for Cognition to provide the Services to you."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the second video: "We can focus on the things that excite us rather than just the maintenancing [maintenance] work".But these are the kinds of problems that help shape the product. The software archictecture should be a compression of a deep and intuitive understanding of the problem space. How can you develop that knowledge if you're just delegating it to a black box that can't operate at a near-human level?I've used ai based tools to great success, but on an ad-hoc basis, for specific and small functions or modules. To do the integration part requires an understanding of what abstraction is appropriate where. I don't think these tools are good that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378994</guid></item><item><title>40.

&lt;p&gt;The BareMetal-OS project on GitHub is an educational operating system designed for learning purposes, focusing on building an OS from the ground up without the complexities of existing OS frameworks. It features a minimalistic design and aims to provide a foundational understanding of operating system concepts such as memory management, process control, and hardware interactions. The repository includes source code, documentation, and guides to help users and developers contribute to and enhance the operating system experience. Overall, it serves as a practical resource for those interested in operating system development and low-level programming.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s always fun to see this get brought up on Hacker News! I’m the developer behind BareMetal OS.Keep in mind that this is all geared toward raw compute and throughput. No ring-3, no multitasking (we do support multiple cores though), and no higher-level abstractions like TCP/IP or full-featured file systems.While it’s all coded in X86-64 assembly, a rewrite to ARM/RISC-V would be interesting once that hardware is standardized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh wow, that's a name I haven't heard since I used to frequent the OSDev forums. I had no idea it was still in development. I recall using Pure64 (BareMetal OS's bootloader) to load my own hobby kernel for a while, in between using GRUB2, and writing my own bootloader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So first, nicely done. But second, why have an OS at all if running only one program and supports only one ISA?"The operating system is another concept that is curious. Operating systems are dauntingly complex and totally unnecessary. It’s a brilliant thing that Bill Gates has done in selling the world on the notion of operating systems. It’s probably the greatest con game the world has ever seen...
    An operating system does absolutely nothing for you. As long as you had something—a subroutine called disk driver, a subroutine called some kind of communication support, in the modern world, it doesn’t do anything else."- Chuck Moore, interview in "Masterminds of Programming", 2009&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42374959</guid></item><item><title>42.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This seems to be specifically about the effects of high g-force, but I'll say that learning to fly a military helicopter (in which coping with high g-force isn't a factor) felt like it probably demanded more neuroplasticity than anything else I've ever done.A typical test was being on the aircraft controls while navigating at 100+ knots and 50 feet above the trees, looking out for a nondescript clearing or dirt road on the map while wearing night vision goggles[1], ensuring that you hit checkpoints and land +/- 60 seconds from the designated times, listening to (and responding as necessary) to multiple external radios plus the internal intercom system, and being asked to also recite from memory (or suddenly execute) the procedures for some contingency (e.g aircraft emergency, change to the tactical situation). Everyone struggles through the training, because no prior experience or schooling really prepares you for all that[2], and I suspect that coming out the other end entails a massive reorganization of the brain.[1] Or substitute that with wearing a hood so you can only see the instruments and translating a 2D instrument procedure on paper into a 3D (4D?) reality.[2] Of course selection is based on school and athletic performance, which seems to help, but I don't know how much evidence supports that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do fighter pilots accumulate all that much exposure to G-forces in terms of duration? 2000 flight hours sounds like a lot, but aren't they flying steady most of the time?Wouldn't professional bobsleigh pilots, alpine skiers, formula 1 drivers and  downhill mountain bikers accumulate many more hours of high G-force exposure over the period of say a year?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are they disambiguating between these brain markers being an effect, or a cause, of being an F16 fighter pilot?Like claiming "Becoming an Olympic swimmer causes long torsos, long arms and short legs"They should at least have control group be students in flight school, and then throw out control subjects that don't graduate. Of course, better would be before and after flight hours for same people. Seems pretty obviously flawed to just compare to some random other group of non pilots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378138</guid></item><item><title>43. 2D Racket Syntax</title><link>https://docs.racket-lang.org/2d/index.html</link><description>

It's okay to just shut up and admire sometimes.Good for you for getting that, HackerNews. Except for me.Why isn't the example like this, to show that the notation nests? Or else state clearly that it does not:  (define (same? a b)

Also, the empty cell in the upper left of #2dcond could be used for specifying the default value, overriding the #f default default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2D languages are an under-researched area of SW dev, IMHO, But I applaud this effort.On the one hand, they can significantly reduce the cognitive effort expressing and understanding code with complex relationships, OTOH they're a bit of a nightmare to actually use, especially the ones that use some form of ASCII art.I wrote a parser for a simple petri net flow diagram that used ASCII art that constructed the state machine between function calls. It worked well until I actually tried to do anything serious with it. The effort required to keep the chart looking tidy quickly outweighs the effort writing a normal pure-code form.IMO, a more "Pythonic", indentation-based diagram may be better but I think you're restricted then in the types of problems you can express.As I say, this all needs more research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Racket and Scheme are full of these things that appear a little unhinged but then you realize that it's all built from a few very simple principles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42373051</guid></item><item><title>44.

It's beautiful and clean without being boring, with great use of typography (of course) and the grid and whitespace. Responsive too, and doesn't hijack your scrolling like so many animated sites do.Hope they make more pages like that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a great font! Very matter-of-fact, but with some stylistic choices that give it just enough character to be interesting. The x-height in the original version is too large for setting body copy, but the variable font comes with an axis for the optical size, which allows tweaking the x-height individually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this GIF (https://airport.revolvertype.com/img/typewriter_airports.gif) is supposed to emulate the good old split-flap displays, then it kind of misses the point - on those displays, the letters changed individually, so the font would need to be fixed width (and uppercase).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42348855</guid></item><item><title>46.

(I'd love to be proved wrong here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barring niche areas, US companies generally treat ICs as a commodity across vast swaths of commercial/industrial activities. In a sense, it's not very different from apparel, which is almost entirely outsourced. We would be in the same boat with automobile manufacturing were it not for unions. This is not going to change overnight. The costs of outsourcing would have to become prohibitively higher for domestic production to return in any appreciable amount. Until then, we should expect the torch to be carried by private industry (ex. Apple) who have other incentives to safeguard their IC production and supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is economic war. China now is taking over the car economy from Japan, Europe and USA. And I believe they have ambitious on semiconductor as well. The world has demand on high end chips also require cheap chips which does the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42295110</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses Starlink's new service that enables direct satellite communication with mobile phones, eliminating the need for traditional cellular infrastructure. This innovative technology allows users in remote or underserved areas to connect to the internet via satellites orbiting the Earth. The service aims to enhance connectivity during emergencies and in rural regions, providing a significant advancement in global communication capabilities. The rollout of this service is set to transform how people access mobile data, particularly in hard-to-reach locations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest reason I'm happy about this: while Starlink currently cooperates with local governments, that's not a technical limitation, and a flip of a switch would let every cell phone in a country have unfiltered connectivity. That's a powerful tool to have readily available, the next time an oppressive regime tries to prevent people from communicating and reporting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previous similar posts on HN:Starlink Direct to Cell (799 comments):https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230103Starlink Successfully Tests Space Direct to Cell Mobile Service (204 comments):https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38982389&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know this says it will work on existing phones without modification, but will it work with all existing LTE phones, or just the ones with a new-enough modem?For example, the Pixel 9 has a Exynos 5400 modem, which advertises satellite connectivity as one of its features. The upcoming Pixel 9a will use the older Exynos 5300, which does not have that same satellite feature.It's not clear (to me) whether the newer modem's satellite feature refers to this or something else. Will the Pixel 9a be able to use this Starlink service once both are available to the general public?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42350619</guid></item><item><title>48.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the impact of earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia, and the innovative response to rebuilding educational infrastructure through the creation of "Lego schools." After a series of devastating quakes in 2018, local communities came together to construct temporary schools using modular Lego-like blocks, providing students with safe spaces to learn while encouraging community involvement and resilience. The initiative not only meets immediate educational needs but also fosters a sense of hope and recovery among the affected populations, illustrating how creative solutions can emerge in the aftermath of natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

A gyro rotates stably on a single axis. Your cooker "tumbles" on three axes at once. A gyroscope specifically prevents tumbling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you noticed that a gyro sandwich is only cooked in one axis?I built a contraption to slow cook in multiple axes and documented it here:https://transistor-man.com/gyroscopic_gyros.htmlNot only is it tasty, it's mesmerizing to watch. Feel free to copy the design for your own festivities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it actually work? Watching the video[0] it seems like the same end of the gyros keeps being pointed upwards/downwards.I suppose it's difficult to balance the slab of meat perfectly.Anyway, it's hilarious!

&lt;p&gt;The document provides details on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulations and policies for ensuring accessible communication for individuals with disabilities. It outlines the requirements for telecommunications services and equipment, including the provision of relay services, hearing aids compatibility, and closed captioning. The FCC emphasizes the importance of fostering equal access to communication technologies for all individuals and includes various initiatives and guidelines aimed at improving accessibility in telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is cool, I hope Australia follows suit!Australia's communications regulator, ACMA, has already permitted Wi-Fi 6E devices to operate in the lower 6 GHz band (5925–6425 MHz) under the Low Interference Potential Devices (LIPD) Class Licence. This includes low-power indoor (LPI) and very low power (VLP) devices.As for the upper 6 GHz band (6425–7125 MHz), ACMA is still evaluating its use. In June 2024, it sought public input on possible applications, including RLANs and wide-area wireless broadband services.So, while unlicensed device operations are allowed in the lower 6 GHz band, the upper band is still under consideration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chart of all US frequency allocations (as of 2016, but there doesn't appear to be a more up to date one?): https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/januar...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if this is going to be the distraction to suggested changes in 900MHz.My other guess is the major uses of this will turn out to be UWB related:

Which in practice is largely about short range location finding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:02:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42390344</guid></item><item><title>2.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://aistudio.google.com/live is by far the coolest thing here. You can just go there and share your screen or camera and have a running live voice conversation with Gemini about anything you're looking at. As much as you want, for free.I just tried having it teach me how to use Blender. It seems like it could actually be super helpful for beginners, as it has decent knowledge of the toolbars and keyboard shortcuts and can give you advice based on what it sees you doing on your screen. It also watched me play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and it successfully identified some of the characters and told me some information about them.You can enable "Grounding" in the sidebar to let it use Google Search even in voice mode. The video streaming and integrated search make it far more useful than ChatGPT Advanced Voice mode is currently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I released a new llm-gemini plugin with support for the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, here's how to use that in the terminal:    llm install -U llm-gemini
    llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-exp 'prompt goes here'

LLM installation: https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.htmlWorth noting that the Gemini models have the ability to write and then execute Python code. I tried that like this:    llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-exp -o code_execution 1 \
      'write and execute python to generate a 80x40 ascii art fractal'

Here's the result: https://gist.github.com/simonw/0d8225d62e8d87ce843fde471d143...It can't make outbound network calls though, so this fails:    llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-exp  -o code_execution 1 \
      'write python code to retrieve https://simonwillison.net/ and use a regex to extract the title, run that code'

Amusingly Gemini itself doesn't know that it can't make network calls, so it tries several different approaches before giving up: https://gist.github.com/simonw/2ccfdc68290b5ced24e5e0909563c...The new model seems very good at vision:    llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-exp describe -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pelicans.jpg

I got back a solid description, see here: https://gist.github.com/simonw/32172b6f8bcf8e55e489f10979f8f...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big companies can be slow to pivot, and Google has been famously bad at getting people aligned and driving in one direction.But, once they do get moving in the right direction the can achieve things that smaller companies can't. Google has an insane amount of talent in this space, and seems to be getting the right results from that now.Remains to be seen how well they will be able to productize and market, but hard to deny that their LLM models aren't really, really good though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388783</guid></item><item><title>3.

No, the topic does not make that ok. As you'll see when you review the guidelines, "Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;https://archive.is/8q8m8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is probably the correct decision. Alex Jones's vitamin company offered 2x more cash, and in the case of a bankruptcy, cash completely trumps any notion of "giving up debt." Especially when the debt being settled is astronomically large and you are giving up a very small portion of it ($7 million out of $1.5 billion). The other creditors are far better off getting more cash, and those $7 million of claims are worth way less than one cent per dollar.Additionally, the auction here was run farcically, and basically seemed designed to create an outcome where the onion gets to buy this website for no money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42384921</guid></item><item><title>4.

&lt;p&gt;General Motors has suspended funding for the development of robotaxis by its subsidiary, Cruise, amidst challenges in the autonomous vehicle sector. The decision comes as Cruise faces regulatory hurdles and increasing competition, which have led to financial concerns. GM emphasizes a need to reassess its investments in autonomous technology while focusing on more immediate priorities. This move highlights the growing difficulties in bringing self-driving cars to market successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42381637"&gt;Comment Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; GM said in a statement that “... an increasingly competitive robotaxi market” were the reasons for the change.Isn't there basically Google/Waymo and then, seemingly much further behind, Tesla Cybertaxi, Amazon/Zoox, and Uber/Yandex? Cruise allegedly has one of the most sophisticated autonomous driving platforms, and GM's Super Cruise (if they share any tech) is comparable to Tesla FSD. Strange that they would bow out.Small anecdote: I visited a GM dealership this week and the salesperson told me Super Cruise was not enabled for test drives. The excuse was pretty weak, like the dealership would have to pay for the service or something. GM might have the technology but they are completely bungling the strategy.Ford just lowered the cost of its BlueCruise subscription by 1/3rd. In an earnings call eight months prior they remarked they made a 70% margin on the service. It seems like drivers did not find the feature compelling and were not renewing. Interest in autonomous driving appears to be cooling across the board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's an interesting "lidar gem" from Hacker News a few years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33554679Lidar obstacle detection algorithm from a Git repo leaked onto TorThis is a drivable region mapping (obstacle detection) algorithm found in what appears to be a git repo leaked from an autonomous vehicle company in 2017. The repo was available through one or more Tor hidden services for several years.The lidar code appears to be written for the Velodyne HDL-32E. It operates in a series of stages, each stage refining the output of the previous stage. This algorithm is in the second stage. It is the primary obstacle detection method, with the other methods making only small improvements.The leaked code uses a column-major matrix of points and it explicitly handles NaNs (the no-return points). We've rewritten it to use a much more cache-efficient row-major matrix layout and a conditional that will ignore the NaN points without explicit testing.This is an amazingly effective method of obstacle detection, considering its simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sad news IMO. "We're not cut out for the future. We're all in on the dying business." Dunder Mifflin level stuff.Cruise cars were way more numerous around SF, although the service was worse than Waymo's. That stupid October 2023 accident really snowballed, and it wasn't even their (primary) fault.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42381637</guid></item><item><title>5.

It’s a shame to see that (edit: iOS) App Store restrictions have prevented browsing any instances not on a pre-blessed list. That all but eliminates its usefulness to me as a self-hoster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like PeerTube and most of Framasoft's products but like most federated software, I think they have a branding and marketing problem that prevents them from growing any bigger. Mastodon did as well and before they revised a lot of their site, no more "toots" for example. I say this knowing that they say their goal is education not growth but you need growth to reach the people you want to educate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a specific App Store rule that prevents them to let users add custom streams?It sounds functionally the same as adding instances to a Mastodon client or RSS feeds into a Podcast app. What's the catch?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388488</guid></item><item><title>6.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the evolution of an ergonomic workspace setup, detailing the author's journey in enhancing comfort and productivity while working. It emphasizes the importance of proper equipment, such as adjustable chairs and desks, to promote better posture and reduce strain. The author shares personal experiences with different configurations and tools, highlighting the benefits of a customized ergonomic approach that adapts to individual needs and preferences. Overall, the piece aims to inspire readers to prioritize their own ergonomic setups for improved well-being and work efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I imagine we'll be seeing more personalized setups as time progresses. Custom keyboards have been pretty feasible and affordable for a good while now, with things like QMK and even custom PCB designers. It can still be a bit fiddly, so it's mostly keyboard nutters such as myself who go down that rabbit hole.Custom trackpads/mice/trackballs haven't gained as much traction, they're not quite as simple as keyboards, and maybe fewer people realise they could benefit from one. I think I might like an upright ergonomic mouse that's shaped to my hand, but then I'm so glued to my keyboard that it hardly seems worth the effort.As a child I always wanted a chair with a split keyboard built into the armrests. Probalby inspired by Palpatine's fancy chair. Maybe I'll make that investment one day ...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This does look very cool. But my advise for anyone suffering from pain to their arms, hands, backs, and any other body parts that usually hurt for people working on computer all day: Do modest, but regular mobility and strength exercises. 
While having an ergonomic (and cool looking at that) setup is important, it wont save you from muscle atrophy. A physical therapist might help you find the right kind of exercises for you. 
This is often not obvious, because the muscle you need to reinforce / train are often not actually the one hurting. And you need to do it regularly. But if you stick to it, the payoff is much better than any setup I ever had.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All I need is a mac with the screen at the right height (at my eye level). So far the best setup I came up with is long car mount for my 12inch iPad. The iPad sits above my macbook screen. I use this on planes and at tables without monitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:03:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42386025</guid></item><item><title>7.

&lt;p&gt;The article "The Myth of Bananaland" explores the historical context and misconceptions surrounding the concept of "Bananaland," a term that often refers to exploitation and dependence in banana-producing nations, particularly in Central America. It delves into the socio-economic impacts of banana plantations, the influence of American companies in the region, and the broader implications of foreign intervention in local economies. The piece challenges simplistic narratives by highlighting the complexities of these political and economic relationships, emphasizing the realities faced by the local populations affected by these dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article announces the beta release of Electric SQL, a new open-source tool designed to simplify the integration and synchronization of SQL databases with modern application frameworks. It emphasizes the tool's capabilities for real-time data synchronization, ease of use, and support for various SQL databases. The release is aimed at developers looking to enhance their applications by ensuring consistency between database states and their respective frameworks while also detailing features, setup instructions, and how users can contribute feedback to improve the product further.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have followed a lot of these projects because I have clients with persistent state and synced state too, as well as realtime needs. Anyway, this passes the smell test imo. It’s solid engineering and built from first principles, reusing the right pieces. So congrats!My concern with DB startups is always the business model. There’s a massive tension between open source and a sustainable business which is much more prevalent with deeply technical products. So either it’s too open and dies because aws eats their lunch or it’s too closed to be useful for self-hosting, or too complex to self-host, or priced too high for small players. What’s the strategy to build/grow the business in the short-medium term?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is really amazing as is their standalone pglite project, which is a WASM port of Postgres.  One surprise for me though is that Electric is a read only replica.  In particular, “Electric does read-path sync. It syncs data out-of Postgres, into local apps and services. Electric does not do write-path sync. It doesn't provide (or prescribe) a built-in solution for getting data back into Postgres from local apps and services.”  https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/writes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I listened to https://www.localfirst.fm/18 recently from Electric-SQL. One of the things James mentioned was that Electric lets you use commodity CDNs for distributing sync data, which takes the load off your main Postgres and servers.This seems like a good pattern, but of lower value for a SaaS app with many customers storing private data in your service. This is because the cache hit-rate for any particular company's data would be low. Is this an accurate assessment, or did I misunderstand something?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:04:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42383136</guid></item><item><title>9. 2400 phone providers may be shut down by the FCC for failing to stop robocalls</title><link>https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408083A1.txt</link><description>

I then used the dx command line app to create a new project. After initialization I ran dx serve in the directory as instructed, but it gave me a compiler error with seemingly no feedback on what specifically went wrong. And again, this is for a hello world app that they generated for me. I'm unsure how to obtain more information on why it failed.I feel like I'd have more insight and ability to debug this if I were trying to compile using a standard rust workflow rather than their CLI tool.You can press v to enable verbose logging, but this doesn't add information which provides clarity to me.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses criticisms of Google's claims regarding achieving quantum supremacy, specifically questioning the validity of the concept and the metrics used to define it. It presents arguments that suggest the results Google's quantum computer produced might not be as groundbreaking as portrayed, emphasizing the need for rigorous scrutiny and alternative perspectives in evaluating quantum computing advancements. The author aims to stimulate discussion on the implications of these claims for the future of quantum technology and its impact on computational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

The timing of the post was indeed related to Google's Willow announcement and the fantastic septillion assertion. It is not clear why Google added to the announcement of nice published results about quantum error correction a hyped undocumented fantastic claim. I think that our work on Google's 2019 experiment provides useful information for evaluating Google's scientific conduct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strange timing given the claim was in 2019, guess this post was generated because of Willow.Google claims to have proved its supremacy with new quantum computer (256 points, 1 year ago, 229 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36567839Quantum computers: amazing progress, but probably false supremacy claims (126 points, 5 years ago, 73 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21167368Google Achieves Quantum Supremacy.

Will he start listening now?In short, what this injunction does is a) remove the checkbox, b) return ACF to WPEngine, c) restore access to website, d) no bond required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope Matt considers placing all the community resources of Wordpress into the foundation, including Wordpress.org, constituting an actual board, contributing funds, and setting up a governance and contribution system that matches the open ethos of the license and community.I think this is an area that Drupal gets right, and Dries wrote an interesting post about it in October:https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, they did use Matt's Hacker News comments against him.

It’s a Klondike Solitaire PWA (progressive web application).I started making it in 2016 and I’ve been slowly iterating on it over time. It has stayed minimal &amp; lightweight, on purpose. No framework, no cruft, no obtrusive ads.Fun fact: because it’s so lightweight, it was included in 2020 in Moya (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nu.bi.moya), a popular messaging app in South Africa that is “data-free” for users (it does reverse-billing).

I have a background in 3d printing and through that I realized that the sweet spot for 3d printed products is something that is small, high value, and custom. The jewelry industry fits this perfectly, and has already seen a large uptake in 3d printer adoption.I built a pipeline using fabric.js, flask, and blender that lets me take my customer's customizations (fingerprints, signatures, other engravings) and place them on a ring. I ultimately generate a STL file that I send over to my casting house in LA. They 3d print the STL in wax, and then cast that wax mould with precious metals using the traditional casting process.It's a fun side business as I get to tinker with new technologies (recently working on integrating a LLM into the ring design process).

&lt;p&gt;PG Roll is a platform dedicated to simplifying the process of applying for and managing medical cannabis cards. It offers a user-friendly interface where individuals can access information about eligibility requirements, locate telemedicine services, and understand the application process. The site aims to provide resources and support, enabling users to navigate the complexities of obtaining a cannabis card legally and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pgroll shines if you are doing slow rollouts.Recently on the market for a tool to manage SQL migration patches with no need for slow rollouts, I reviewed many such tools and the one that impressed me was sqitch: https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitchSo if you are interrested in this field and if Pgroll is not quite what you are looking for, I recommand you have a look at sqitch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We've looked into this tool a couple times, haven't adopted it yet. The main issue is compatibility with prisma, which we use for defining our db's schema and automating migrations. If there were a slick integration between the two, that would go a long way to convincing us to adopt. In the meantime, we'll go with convenience and (slightly, almost immeasurably) lower reliability. We haven't had downtime due to a migration in months!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does anyone know of similar tool for MS SQL?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388973</guid></item><item><title>15.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the transition of a busy Rails developer to using Django with PostgreSQL, highlighting the benefits of Django's framework, ease of use, and how it can streamline development processes. It emphasizes the similarities and differences between Rails and Django, sharing personal experiences, challenges faced during the learning curve, and tips for successfully adapting to the new technology stack. The author encourages other developers to embrace new frameworks for enhanced productivity and versatility in their skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm working on a Rails and on a Django project for two different customers and I've been doing that for years now. I'd pick Rails over Django any time for every single feature.The absolute worst Django feature is the templating language. It seems to be designed to slow down developers to the like of old time Java web apps, almost mandatory templatetags et all.The query language is moderately bad, quite verbose (Model.objects every time) for no good reason.The lack of common project structure means that every project is different.There is no Capistrano to deploy. I wrote something like that myself and we have been using it for maybe 7 years.I'm sure I could go on for a while if I keep thinking about it, but you got the gist of it.On the Rails side, sometimes I'd like to have a talk with some of the previous developers of the Rails app, which hid some important functionality in a before save callback in a different module for no particular reason, but one can be too clever with Python too. However the language (Python) is quite dull, which can be a good or a bad thing. It's very subjective. It's a Ruby gone bad at design time to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a longtime Rails developer who has experimented with Python but knew little about Django, I read this article with interest. Something that jumped out at me was the author's description of the "models.py file, which contains all the application models (multiple models in a single file)". I did some quick research and I gather that this approach isn't maintained as you move beyond the scale of a toy application. I kind of think he's doing Django a disservice with his current wording there, as my immediate reaction was that it sounded nightmarish!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time with Django, and not a lot of time with rails.For me, if I was doing minimalist CRUD and wanted to ship to mobile or a lot of users, I’d reach for Rails. Hotwire and Turbo seem great, and the ecosystem just seems better and more developed for customer facing stuff.Most of my work has been internal tooling with an emphasis on data analytics or geospatial. Having python libs run natively is a big win for data analysis, and as another commenter posted, geodjango is very tough to beat for usability for geospatial work. For this I still maintain Django is pretty unbeatable.I am happy to be corrected in both domains though, again, not much rails experience here beyond a couple toy projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388340</guid></item><item><title>16.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the introduction of a new feature by Mullvad VPN that allows users to create multiple unique identities within the service. This feature aims to enhance privacy by enabling users to generate separate identities for different online activities, thereby limiting the linkage of their internet usage to a single identity. Additionally, the article highlights Mullvad’s commitment to user privacy and its ongoing efforts to improve security measures, emphasizing the importance of anonymous browsing in today’s digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;VPNs are a great business these days, but I don't feel that they treat their customers properly, or that they're transparent about what they provide.My sense is that there's a lot of BS going on. Including the fact that "cool" VPNs are supposed to be coming from Scandinavian countries (but most of them aren't).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct link to the PDF report:https://x41-dsec.de/static/reports/X41-Mullvad-Audit-Public-...Titles of issues they found:4.1.1 MLLVD-CR-24-01: Signal Handler’s Alternate Stack Too Small4.1.2 MLLVD-CR-24-02: Signal Handler Uses Non-Async-Safe Functions4.1.3 MLLVD-CR-24-03: Virtual IP Address of Tunnel Device Leaks to Net-

The dedicated threat model section is something that a lot of auditing outfits skip over in their reports. While I'm positive Cure53, Assured, and Atredis (the previous auditors) established an appropriate threat model with Mullvad prior to engagement, it's not explicitly written out for the reader, which opens up room for misinterpretation of the findings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42390768</guid></item><item><title>17.

They're pretty fast, relative to RISC-V (although not relative to x86): https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2024/11/19/benchmarking-risc-v-sp...Note the benchmark is not very rigorous, but it reflects what we want to do with these boards which is to build Fedora packages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$400 (16GB DDR5) and $500 (32GB DDR5) because that's not in the blog post.But I have some questions:Why the weird form factor? Mini-DTX is supported by a lot of cases but as a motherboard form factor it's incredibly niche compared to Mini-ITX and especially Micro-ATX.Edit: DTX supposed to be an open standard but it's already a "dead" platform https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_(form_factor)Why the eMMC? There is an M.2 E key but that's for wireless connection only. Is it a platform limitation that M.2 SSDs can't be used?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that the link in the announcement takes you to the 32 GB, which is (instantly?) out of stock.16 GB (which is enough for a quad core, IMO) is $399 with "375 in stock, ships tomorrow"https://www.arrow.com/en/products/hf106/sifive-incI ordered a Milk-V Megrez (same SoC but 1.8 GHz vs 1.4 GHz here) for $100 less a week ago.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the need for clarity in the behavior of the `memcpy` and `memset` functions in C, specifically addressing how these functions should handle null pointers. It highlights the implications of these functions returning `NULL` for a zero-length copy and proposes a solution to ensure that the behavior of `memcpy` and `memset` with null pointers is well-defined, promoting a more consistent and understandable use of these functions in programming practices. The piece emphasizes the importance of clearly defining expected outcomes to avoid ambiguity and enhances code reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good mental model is to compare the number of floats being processed -vs- the number of primitive computations. Matrix multiplication has n^3 computation with n^2 data. Multiplication of large matrices is therefore special in the potential for "data re-use" (each float is used against all the columns or rows of the other matrix) -- so systems are designed to have a much higher flops throughput than memory bandwidth. A dot product is at the other extreme, where each float is used only once (loosely).Roofline plots [1] are framework to visualize system design from this perspective.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Each version is severely memory bandwidth bottlenecked, the CUDA version suffers the most with its practical 11.8 GB/s device-to-host bandwidth due to its PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface.PCIe 3.0? What?https://cowfreedom.de/#appendix/computer_specs/&gt; GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with Max-Q Design (PCIe 3.0 x16) (2016)&gt; Intel Core i5-8300H  (2020)This is a low-price 8 year old GPU and a 4 year old CPU. And he seems to be including loading the data to GPU. Newer cards have wide PCIe 5.0 or some faster interconnect, like Nvidia Grace-Hopper.Also he is comparing his own CUDA implementation. He should use one of the many available in CUBLAS/CUTLASS. Making a good CUDA GEMM is a very difficult art and very hardware specific&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is the compute vs communicate ratio.For problems like Matrix Multiplication, it costs N to communicate the problem but N^2 operations to calculate.For problems like dot product, it costs N to communicate but only N operations to calculate.Compute must be substantially  larger than communication costs if you hope to see any benefits. Asymptotic differences obviously help, but linear too might help.You'd never transfer N data to perform a log(n) binary search for example. At that point communication dominates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:05:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388009</guid></item><item><title>20.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick summary after following this for a few days:
FBI says they're rotary and fixed-wing drones, White House says they aren't foreign adversaries, Pentagon says they aren't USA military, all 3 insist that there's no indication of a real threat despite the drones being bigger and higher tech than retail drones.Politicians are PO'd that something about this doesn't add up:  How can anyone know these aren't a threat without knowing whose they are?  Why isn't anyone bringing them down?  Where do they land?  Is this similar to the Chinese spy balloon?I've seen a huge number of theories by now, and not one of them actually fits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The photos I've seen posted look very obviously like commercial airliners and helicopters with their navigation lights on. You can even make out the American Airlines livery on the tail!https://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2024/12/11/d...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seems like an opportunity for a training exercise.  Have the FAA put a TFR in place and let the national guard interdict,  ECW and such.  Take control, land it in the x-ray scanner, check for explosives then take it apart and get telemetry data.  The US taught Ukraine how to do this with great success.  If no joy on ECW, disassemble them in the sky.If the drones were legit they would be broadcasting their ID as would the controllers and they would be within visible range unless they have the approved part 107 on file or part 107 waiver and approval for long range drone usage.If these are not really drones and it is just mass hysteria the national guard would rule that out rather fast.  As a bonus there is no added cost to the tax payer aside from the small fuel expense to route around the TFR which pilots are accustom to.  This is just swapping out one training exercise with another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:00 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42391443</guid></item><item><title>21.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previous baggage handler turned software dev here. Looks like you are targeting the bag room right now which is the best spot to start to prove the concept. It was surprising to me how manual the entire loading &amp; sorting process was when I worked for the airlines.I'm curious if there's any roadmap eventually to get this out to the ramp itself. Most of the back injuries seemed to happen in the bin itself because you have to often hunch/be on your knees in a bin tossing 50+ pound bags. I know airlines would probably be very hesitant to have any new equipment around their planes but just curious if there's any discussion around that.Other side note, I also used to work in Cargo and always thought there could be way more efficient ways of loading loose packages that are on every flight and this seems to be a great possibility for those as well.Awesome work &amp; will keep tabs on it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is much like a palletizer. Here's a mixed-case cage palletizer, which fills up wire cages open on one side with various boxes.[1] For rectangular boxes, palletizing is a solved problem with many companies selling systems.Irregular items are a problem. In the baggage handling video, the last bag, the soft one with straps, is sticking out after being placed in the baggage container. That's the same problem which keeps Amazon from totally automating picking. They keep trying, but nothing works well enough yet.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN-6QaLd3VY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another HN roboticist chiming in; the videos look good! I have many questions, but will keep it to just a couple for brevity's sake.- How much are you able to use the robot's internals to estimate the gripped bag's inertial properties? If you're trying to put rigid, heavy bags below light, amorphous bags, are you adjusting final placement location on-the-fly?- How dynamic is your scene beyond what we can observe? If you're using light curtains with a single robot on a track, and you're able to estimate some rough geometry of and track the bags down the conveyance, and you are updating occupancy of the bin as you're going, what else is there?- Is this just inside for the foreseeable future or are you all going to tackle unpacking outside, as well as all the, ahem, baggage that comes along with operating outside the terminal walls.Nice and straightforward problem, relatively speaking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42390761</guid></item><item><title>22.

&lt;p&gt;The article "Dear OAuth Providers" addresses common frustrations and challenges faced by developers when integrating OAuth authentication into applications. It highlights issues such as inconsistent implementations, poor documentation, and a lack of standardized practices among various OAuth providers. The author emphasizes the need for better communication, clearer guidelines, and improved user experiences in order to foster a more efficient and user-friendly authentication process. Ultimately, the piece calls for collaboration between developers and OAuth providers to enhance the overall integration experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What really grinds my gears about OAuth is when there’s 5 providers, plus an email signup, and I forgot which one I used last time. Then I end up creating a new account accidentally, sometimes with no way to retrieve the old one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A year ago we implemented OAuth for 100 popular APIs.Our experience was exactly like OP describes: https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to add that so many providers do not support either `prompt=select_account` or just natively ask the user which account to login to, mainly for OIDC. Working with IAM systems at work and using different test accounts, it's frustrating when you can't easily log out of the destination IdP for, say, SSO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388870</guid></item><item><title>23.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For any engineer interested in nuclear weapons, I highly recommend this three-part series produced by Sandia National Laboratory on their development of Permissive Action Link, the warhead’s electrical isolation and cryptological module that ensures US nuclear weapons will detonate if any only if authorized by the President.It’s fascinating how they thought about bad path scenarios like thermal damage causing carbon tracking of PCBs potentially defeating the control system.It is called “Always/Never: The Quest for Safety, Control, and Survivability”Part 1: https://youtu.be/DQEB3LJ5pskPart 2: https://youtu.be/sb2qo5m_hTYPart 3: https://youtu.be/0a1exo_vU_k&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suspect I have the same "nuclear archaeologist cyber-friend" as the author.I sent a Twitter "friend" (who labelled himself a nuclear anthropologist instead of archeologist) a copy of a book called "100 Suns" by Michael Light, which is a coffee table sized book full of photos of nuclear tests. The book is eerily beautiful: http://www.michaellight.net/suns-introIn return (and entirely unexpectedly) he send me a small package with a handful of small pieces of that Mark 17 bomb casing he collected in Albuquerque - just like that last pic in the article. They're sitting on a shelf with my piece of Trinitite and my pieces of Maralingite (sand fused to glass by an atomic test in the 50s/60s at Maralinga in South Australia)I have some weird internet friends who know my weird interests...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There have been many broken arrows¹.  Each one is a terrifying and fascinating story and it's one of my favorite Wikipedia rabbit holes which I think everyone should be at least somewhat familiar with. At least to appreciate the real, terrible costs of developing, and then maintaining these weapons, in a high alert operational state, continuously for many decades.  The fact that most of these accidents were classified and hidden from the public, for 20 or 30 years, is troubling.  The military (correctly) assumed that they would lose a lot of public support had the truth been known at the time.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_nuclear...2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accid...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42382759</guid></item><item><title>24.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's nice to see support for vulkan in qemu actually getting somewhere, being able to run modern accelerated workloads inside a vm (without dealing with sr-iov) is pretty cool and definitely has some use cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Features like this are why I prefer using QEMU directly rather than an abstraction like libvirt on top of QEMU.Graphical interfaces like virt-manager are nice at first, but I don't need an abstraction on top of multiple hypervisors to make them all look superficially the same, because they're not. Eventually the abstraction breaks down and gets in the way.I need the ability to use the full capability of QEMU. I'll write a shell script to manage the complexity of the arguments. At least I don't have to deal with XML, validation, and struggling with enabling the options I want that are only supported by one specific emulator, which libvirt doesn't support, because it's not common to all of the backends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't SR-IOV which is a hardware feature for virtualizimg GPUs. The problem is the OEMs that gate this feature for enterprise products. Few people buy them so the state of the software ecosystem for virtual GPU is terrible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42392802</guid></item><item><title>25.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores how the phenomenon of particle collisions can provide insights into the fundamental nature of reality. It discusses the significance of particle accelerators in advancing our understanding of subatomic particles and their interactions, revealing the underlying structures of the universe. By analyzing the results of these collisions, physicists can test theories related to the fundamental forces of nature and the existence of dark matter, contributing to the broader quest to understand the cosmos and the laws governing it.&lt;/p&gt;

And I still remind myself of that. If you fundamentally understand your problem and solve it, then writing a few characters in your favorite text editor that do the task is easy- [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a nice recap of recent advancements in theoretical computer science (quantum computing, adaptations to Dijkstra's algorithm, busy beavers).Though do note there's many other branches in compsci than theoretical computer science. I would've added "theoretical" in the title and the intro "... Ben Brubaker unpacks what computer science is really about" seems a bit much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the optimal algorithm for dijkstas shortest path mentioned in the article get used for something immediately consequential and very time sensitive?. My intuition would think routing internet traffic could be a good us case, but I may be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:06:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305117</guid></item><item><title>26.

I knew custom Google silicon was used for inference, but I didn't realize it was used for training too. Does this mean Google is free of dependence on Nvidia GPUs? That would be a huge advantage over AI competitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How good is Trillium/TPU compared to Nvidia? It seems the stats are: tpu v6e achieves 900 TFLOPS per chip (fp16) while Nvidia H100 achieves 1800 TFLOPS per gpu? (fp16)?Would be neat if anyone has benchmarks!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy conglomerate discount on Alphabet if you can see TPUs as the only Nvidia competitor for training.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the challenges of accurately storing time for human events, highlighting the complexities involved in ensuring that timestamps are both human-readable and machine-processable. It emphasizes the need for clarity around time zones, daylight saving time, and the expectations people have regarding how events are stored and interpreted over time. The author suggests best practices for handling time data, advocating for using ISO 8601 formatting and UTC to minimize ambiguity and improve consistency in data handling.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay no problem, I'll post later^W^W forget about it, but that makes me wonder: how can 4 submissions in two weeks even physically happen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One glaring omission from many tools for modeling chronology is that we have date, and datetime, but often don't have a type for just "time".Sometimes you really just want to express that something is going to happen at a certain time, regardless of timezone. If I set my alarm for 7:45 am, I need it to ring when the clock says 7:45 am, wherever in the world I happen to be.This is how most human beings think about time - school starts at 8 am, work starts at 9 am, McDonald's serves breakfast until 10 am, my doctor's appointment is at 4pm... these are all things that remain constant regardless of whether daylight savings time starts or ends, whether our business changes locations to a different state, whether we are conquered by the Romans and our calendar changes... so they should be stored as such, without a timezone attached.Then from there you can combine a "date" and a "time" and a "location / timezone" to form a "datetime", to figure out the actual technological instant something needs to happen, based on the user's location and/or the location the event is going to take place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One point from this article that I think is great is: the TZ database maps pretty poorly onto how people think about timezones.In the states, I think most people I know are familiar with "eastern time" or "pacific time." But I doubt that many of my friends recognize "Americas/New_York" or appreciate why they need to select that instead of "Americas/Indianapolis" when referencing eastern time[1]. I certainly wasn't familiar with referencing timezones this way until I had a job that cared a whole lot about timezones and had offices in several countries!I like the idea of solving this by just asking for the location of an event.[1] having lived in indiana a while ago, I'm assuming that Indianapolis gets its own TZ entry because it wasn't on daylight savings back in the 90s (?). Which was pretty annoying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364372</guid></item><item><title>28.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone with Alzheimer's being quite prevalent on my dad's side [1], I pay attention to pretty much any HN thread on Alzheimer's. But most of them end up not being super conclusive/actionable.But also ack that Alzheimer's research has been going on for decades, and progress is slow. Still, I look for glimmers of hope anytime I see one reach the front page.If fasting has even a chance at reducing the risks, would love to know more about the duration/frequency that is needed to be beneficial.[1] All four of my dad's aunts + grandmother ended up with it, but none of the males to my knowledge, and my dad died at 76 having never been diagnosed with it. The males, however, died relatively young, so it's unknown whether they would've ended up with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As someone currently on a strict ketogenic diet (gotta cut and get ready for the Christmas fattening)I can say ketones are something else in the brain. I sat at my  desk today for 6 hours straight without even getting so much as a drink of water. I didn't even think about eating. Just in the zone and hyper focused.A very weird and pleasant experience, that alas can't be sustained forever given how delicious carbs are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the article:“Early human studies of ketogenic compounds have improved cognitive scores in patients with mild to moderate AD.”While it requires behaviour changes (for the diet), this is something that's relatively easy to test &amp; validate, and with a good sample size.Edit: To elaborate -- getting on a keto diet results in production of ketone bodies; the keto diet is (IMO) hard to adhere to, but not impossible.And if it is ketone bodies in the brain that are important, iirc, you can supplement the body with exogenous ketones (which the article alludes to, and the authors appear to be planning to test) which could potentially help.If there's a measurable, significant effect with just consumption of exogenous ketones without even having to enter ketosis via diet- wow!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42383840</guid></item><item><title>29.

&lt;p&gt;The Helium project, created by mherrmann, is an open-source tool designed for building and simulating agent-based models in a flexible and user-friendly manner. It provides a framework that allows users to define agents, environments, and interactions, facilitating the exploration of complex systems and behaviors. The project includes comprehensive documentation, examples, and installation instructions, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users interested in agent-based modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium project founder here. (Hi!) Thanks for all your work on this project. Lots of negativity around here these days, but just wanted to say thanks. The functional style of Helium's API reminds me a lot of Selenium's original API when it was 100% JavaScript (aka Selenium 1 aka Selenium Core) back in 2004.(Functional style: "method(thing)" 
vs
object oriented style: "thing.method()")We mostly abandoned the functional style when we merged with the WebDriver project (aka Selenium 2), but that functional style still lives on in the Selenium IDE record/playback tool.That is all to say, there are fans of many different styles for automation APIs. No single API will please everyone. (But I personally like the simpler, functional style, fwiw!)Side-note: This is also why I'm a fan of the Nim programming language. "method(thing)" and "thing.method" are supported syntax for literally the same thing. For others new to the idea, the fancy term for this is "Uniform Function Call Syntax".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Importing * is universally discouraged by most Python linters and best practice docs. You can always "import helium as h" if you're looking to type less.This looks largely like common workarounds that most people will write using Python-based browser automation. Most of the time, we accept that those capabilities aren't there by default because they are not explicit enough and can result in bugs and undefined behavior even when the elements that we expect to be on the page are actually there.Given the adage "explicit is better than implicit", I worry that a layer like this might create more trouble than it's worth for the sake of readability. When we get into the nitty-gritty of browser automation, it might just make it harder to debug than going straight to Selenium or Playwright.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having done some ad-hoc, temporary automation with Selenium in the past (to help fellow, less technically-inclined designers) I wish I had this at the time.Looks like a nice, almost natural language-like API around what is otherwise a quite cumbersome API.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:07:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42386971</guid></item><item><title>31.

&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on a unique watch designed by artist and watchmaker Edouard Toledo, which features a meteorite dial made from a 4.5-billion-year-old piece of space rock. The watch blends luxury craftsmanship with the allure of outer space, showcasing Toledo's innovative approach to timepieces. It highlights the artistic and scientific significance of using meteorite slices, emphasizing both their rarity and the intricate details that make each watch a one-of-a-kind creation. The piece also reflects a growing trend in the luxury market, where unconventional materials are embraced for their storytelling potential.&lt;/p&gt;

Meteorite cases are rarer because they are not overly practical. They rust, unless treated, and even then the coating isn't impervious. Still its nice to see a "rolex midas" style watch back on the market. The big watch people (omega, rolex, and the other brands owned by LVMH) are a bit conservative in styles, so its nice to see something different, if brutalist.David Rutten made a  brilliant 1920s style case https://www.watchprosite.com/horological-meandering/hands-on...

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, being overweight has surpassed tobacco smoking as the leading risk factor for disease, according to a recent analysis. This shift highlights the growing health crisis associated with obesity, which is linked to multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. The report emphasizes the need for public health initiatives focused on promoting healthier lifestyles and addressing the obesity epidemic to prevent associated diseases effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This paper provides a helpful breakdown of types of mortalities and how they're associated with BMI. It's interesting to see that the lowest All-cause mortality is at a BMI of 25. A BMI of 30 doesn't increase the hazard ratio that much, but a BMI of ~45 doubles it. The minimum for cancer mortality is notably lower (21) but perhaps surprisingly the minimum communicable disease mortality is at a BMI of 26.https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Overweight, including obesity, overtook tobacco use as the leading risk factor in 2024, driven by a substantial fall (41%) in the burden attributable to tobacco use since 2003.According to the study, it's not so much that more people got fat, it's that fewer people are smoking. A lot of comments here missed this I think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if we'll ever get to a place where we hold food companies accountable for addictive, unheathy food being advertised and sold the way we hold tobacco companies accountable?I know there is a personal responsibility involved in both, but the situation seems similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388273</guid></item><item><title>34.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How in the world can you have a discussion about DVD packaging and special features without mentioning the Lord of the Rings trilogy extended edition box sets? Not only did the movies come in beautiful collector’s cases with two DVDs per movie, they were also completely packed with special features, the run time of which exceeded that of the movies themselves. Hours and hours of in-depth making-of documentaries. I used to watch the special features for all the movies in a row when I was home from college during the holidays. Probably because before the advent of streaming, this was the longest, highest-quality content I had access to.But the special features themselves… man. Getting to see the craft of filmmaking and propmaking was one of the biggest inspirations for me in pursuing a career as a maker. That was the first time in my life anyone had pulled back the curtain to that extent on what it took to create something as complex and powerful as Peter Jackson’s LOTR. You could tell the profound love and dedication that went into every inch of that film. To anyone who was involved in creating those special features and deciding to include them in the extended edition box sets, thank you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The problems with streaming services:- they do not allow anonymous usage (you need to provide a visa application worth amount of personal information)- stupid geographical restrictions- they tend to limit quality, both for copyright and traffic saving purposesAs an intermediate result, a generation of people is growing who got used to watching digitally compressed audio and video (social media, especially for mobile platforms, use even worse compression). And new Apple headphones seem to use lossy compression as well, so we have a codec compressing another codec's artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish there were a way to just pay for a movie on a site and download it as an mp4 in 1080P or 4K. I hate streaming because I only want to watch 1-2 movies per month and they are very specific (like a specific martial arts movie or action movie). Streaming interfaces often have DRM and horrible interfaces and I don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I'll rarely use. Don't understand the DRM because pirates get a better copy anyway.Right now, there is no better and more convenient interface than piracy and I wish that weren't the case.Edit: there is such an interface for classical music, e.g. Hyperion. DRM free and one-time payment, and I've used it a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42347571</guid></item><item><title>35.

&lt;p&gt;The article introduces the Accent Guesser tool, designed to help users identify and understand different English accents. By listening to audio samples and answering a series of questions related to the accents they hear, users can discover their own accent profile. The tool aims to foster better communication and appreciation of the diversity in English accents, making it a useful resource for non-native speakers, language learners, and anyone interested in linguistics. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of accent in cultural identity and personal expression.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's fun but as I tested it I realized how this is pretty much the modern equivalent of a Facebook quiz that asks you the name of your first pet, first car and mother's maiden name.If they recorded any of that they likely have enough to clone my voice somewhat faithfully.Congratulations on labelling my French Canadian accent as French though, I'll have to work on my pronounciation more to fool the AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a big confidence booster for me as when I first started learning English, people would complement me on how well I spoke English, but I took that as my accent was still detectable. It's only been in the past 5 years that people assumed I was American and made no comment on my English at all, until I disclosed that English was my second language. It's usually certain words that give me trouble, like "cupboard" or "chef". The AI detected my accent as a mixture of German and English. When I tried to exaggerate my accent, it correctly detected Thai.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The homepage sort of implies that "having an accent" is something only non native speakers do? Like an accent only comes from your exotic mother tongue. Kinda weird. It told me I'm a native speaker, and I am a non American native speaker so... good I guess?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:30 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42392088</guid></item><item><title>36.

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was in 9th-grade jhs, I performed a similar experiment in my science class.  Nobody had a clue back then (1968) of what 'borax' was or where to get it.  I substituted boraxo hand soap.  For the experiment to work, it took a huge amount.  I didn't use an oscilloscope back in that day.  I remember rigging some kind of polarity detector using an incandescent lamp (probably a #222), and a couple of cheap silicon diodes from Radio Shack.  For electrodes, which were inteneded as lead and aluminum, I used some sheet aluminum my dad kept around for some of his projects, and for the lead, I used a length of 50% lead 50% tin solid wire (no flux core) plumbing solder.  I used a pint-sized mason jar, a mason ring, and cut a top for the jar from some thin cork I had.  I may have used some cheap binding posts to suspenmd the electrodes from.  I made the test right after lunch, say 1:00pm, and proved rectification with a 10-volt drop through the rectifier.  After school, say 3:00 pm, the schools Science club, of which I was a memeber, convened in that room for a regular meeting.  I attempted top repeat the experiment, and it failed: my rectifier wouldn't conduct anything in any direction.  The Boraxo seemed to have 'gelled' in the jar and had turned pink.  I ended up disposing of all the 'mess'.  I never repeated the experiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; This is a circuit connected directly to the power mains. Use proper precautions.Ahhh. The sound of freedom!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I have observed an interesting N type negative resistance effect that happens only when the tip of a very sharp aluminum electrode is just barely touching the top surface of the solution."What exactly does negative resistance mean in this context? Based on the curve shown I would guess as the voltage increases past a point the resistance decreases. But it is fun to imagine this guy has discovered perpetual energy.update: of course there is a wikipedia page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_resistance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:08:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42384111</guid></item><item><title>37.

Every single colour combination was awful, to the point it literally made my eyes hurt, and had so little contrast as to be useless.I’ve seen better designed and clearer websites with two colours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do a (better-looking, I dare say) version of this on my site https://joeldueck.com , which changes the color scheme depending on the outside temp. Currently it's blue because it's a little cold outside. I also have a 1D slider you can play with in the page footer.I have a script [1] grab the local temp and convert that to two hue values, which it stores as CSS variables --base-temp and --accent.Then in my CSS I set colors of various things using hsl() values based on one or the other, e.g.:    background-color: hsl(var(--base-temp),50%,96%);

Every page had a slightly different layout, mistakes and all, for 500 pages. Every single one typed by hand. We stood in awe at this grotesque achievement used to fill only a few seconds of film.And then the archivist brought out the identical boxes for Italian, French, Spanish, German, all typed by hand with a different, locally chilling phrase for each.My shock at this has almost outlasted my admiration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those fans of The Shining, I feel obligated to share my favourite YouTube investigation into a remarkable and little talked about detail.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr6PgWFs0Pw (Overlooked! A detail in The Shining that you’ve never seen)It examines the fact that Jack keeps stealing glances straight at the camera throughout the film (no-one else does this). Probably the best explanation is that Kubrick wanted to unnerve the audience and it's very effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a long time, I wondered why a remake of The Shining was made in 1997 [1].  Now the internet simply explains that this was due to the author of the original novel being dissatisfied with Kubrik's adaptation.

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express. It covers essential topics such as setting up the environment, creating routes, handling requests and responses, and implementing middleware. The author also includes examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it accessible for beginners. By the end of the guide, readers gain the fundamental skills needed to build and deploy their own RESTful APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish somebody would figure out a way to get the Smart Keyboard Folio working with the 13" M4 iPad Pros.I bought one with the Magic Keyboard and returned it. The MK makes it into a laptop and that's not really what I want. The folio is perfect for me. It doesn't add much bulk, it can fold all the way around to be flat, it's easy to remove, and is nice to type on (IMHO).So I'm back to using my well loved 2018 iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard Folio. It's my favorite computer to work on. Not sure what I'm going to do when it finally dies. I don't think I'll have many options aside from giving in and getting a Magic Keyboard. To me, it seems to be the least worst option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is horrible and the result is predictably awful. I love it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This scares me, so I do this, but with a Magic Keyboard connected via Bluetooth and a cheap keyboard case[1]. Perhaps not as portable, but damned close, and doesn't involve any high risk modifications. It works very well.1. https://www.amazon.com/Fintie-Carrying-Apple-Keyboard-MLA22L...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:09:50 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343712</guid></item><item><title>44.

&lt;p&gt;The webpage discusses the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program's efforts to study the occurrence and behavior of pesticides in the nation's waters. It features key findings related to the impact of agricultural practices on water quality, highlighting trends in pesticide concentration over time in various water bodies. The site emphasizes the importance of monitoring and understanding these levels to inform water management strategies and protect public health and the environment. Additionally, it presents case studies and serves as a resource for further research on pesticide contamination and water quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article emphasizes the importance of focus and provides strategies to minimize distractions in order to achieve personal and professional goals. It discusses how to identify and eliminate common distractions, such as digital notifications and multitasking, and suggests structuring one's environment to foster concentration. The author encourages readers to cultivate habits that promote deep work and to remain mindful of their goals to maintain motivation and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a different place a long time ago we were approached by a company that wanted a collaboration. They had a very specific project in mind, with requirements already set. It was a humanitarian project to "find earthquake survivors". If you read the requirements in a very positive way it was an ethically clean project.But the company is a major defense contractor and it was very unusual for them to be involved in humanitarian work. So it made sense to question the requirements after a less generous reading. Detecting mostly occluded humans in a highly cluttered and destroyed urban environment has other use cases. They got as far as "highlighting the survivors with a laser designator" before I started to ask some very pointed questions and start discussing the ethical considerations of us helping to build a system to kill people.I was asked to leave.After that meeting the potential collaboration was rejected and it never came up again. The company continued shopping around other places to get help building their "earthquake rescue system".Never get distracted. Always question the purpose of work. Consider ethics.Getting another job can be a pain. Living with knowing what you helped to build would be much harder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's worth mentioning that this really isn't programming-specific, or even engineering-specific, at all. The exact same story applies to the guy doing finance, or marketing, or project management, or legal work, or whatever. This is basically a reminder that your role as a cog in the wheel is to make the wheel move, and you shouldn't forget what the wheel is doing.That said, working for a US military contractor while not being supportive of the US military mission is kind of a silly thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's pretty much how all people working on tracking features at GAFAMS, all people working on algo manipulating people's behavior on social networks and shopping sites, and incidentally how people working on the manhattan project, moved.They get into the interesting problems and miss the forest for the tree.Plus it's fun to be among smart peers, and well-paid.The author woke up from this, but many do it for their whole life and see no problem with it.That's why I rejected interviews from Google and Facebook. Because I knew I would do the same. It's too tempting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:10 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42388354</guid></item><item><title>46.

&lt;p&gt;The article explores the profound impact of smartphones on human identity and the concept of being a cyborg, highlighting how smartphones have effectively become an extension of ourselves. It discusses the psychological and cultural implications of this relationship, including the sensation of phantom limb-like feelings when phones are absent. The narrative delves into how technology shapes our perceptions and interactions, suggesting that the integration of smartphones into daily life alters human experiences and self-perception in significant ways.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; It’s a widely acknowledged but often underappreciated fact that in less than two decades, smartphones have revolutionized most aspects of everyday human life.Not all revolutions are good... but, yes, this is an entirely fair statement.&gt; While many readers—and devoted smartphone users—may find this influence troubling, abandoning our devices isn’t the solution.Yes.  It really, really is a perfectly good solution, that needs to be far more heavily used than it is.  Don't carry your smartphone.  Power it off.  Carry a flip phone if you must.  Change the default expectation of everyone that you, of course, have a little pocket tracker and will install whatever tracking Apps(TM) you're asked to.  It's utterly absurd that I'm now asked at a gas station, when paying cash, if I'm "using the App."We (the more-tech-aware sorts likely posting here) know what sort of nasty things these devices are up to.  Anything that has your location data is constantly streaming it through SDKs up to shady vendors who will package and resell it to anyone with a checkbook, to be able to retroactively root through people's lives for some reason or another.  We know how the products are designed to be addictive ("Engaging!") - I guarantee more than a few people around here have "A/B tested engagement modifications."Yes, in an ideal world, none of this would be a problem.  But that's not the world we have right now, and I don't believe that minor modifications of this concept of device can improve the state of it.  I've been trying for years to figure out how to make digital consumer tech less-toxic, and the only conclusions I've come to are, "You can't."So I'm happy to be one of those people who clacks a flip phone when someone asks me to install an app to do something inane - or, better, simply states "I don't have a phone on me."  It reminds people that there was life before smartphones - and, experimentally, the reaction I get now, post-Covid, from a flip phone is almost universally, "Wow, I didn't know you could still get those!" - people are very much interested in them now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I do occasionally get twinges in the exact place on my leg that my phone vibrates against when it's in my pocket, even when my phone is in my hand. It's quite unsettling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a similar vein, I feel like a part of me is missing since google doesn't really work the way it used to anymore. Never in my adult life very often have I needed the answer to something trivial and been unable to find it very quickly. It's extremely unsettling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:20 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42357377</guid></item><item><title>47.

&lt;p&gt;The article discusses research indicating a significant shift in carbon storage within the Arctic tundra, where rising temperatures are causing the thawing of permafrost. This process releases stored carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Scientists warn that the resulting increase in greenhouse gases could accelerate warming, creating a feedback loop that further impacts global climate systems. The urgency of addressing these changes is highlighted, as they pose serious implications for both the environment and human activities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting article and I must say I am quite surprised having used Whatsapp religiously for now over a decade that I had never heard about _WhatsApp for Business_. Makes me wonder when I will get to interact with this part of the app too... Not that I want to though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&gt; Newton-Rex said privacy is “in the DNA” of WhatsApp and that the company is trying to clearly communicate with users about what privacy protections WhatsApp offers and where.This is bunk. If someone is added to a Group Chat they get everyone's phone number. There's near zero privacy for Groups and Communities.This sort of article is a puff-piece for WhatsApp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to WhatsApp for Business, my inbox is constantly flooded with spam and scams. Companies register hundreds of numbers, and no matter how many I block, they always find new ones to message me. The worst part is that reporting and blocking seem completely ineffective on WhatsApp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:10:40 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42366753</guid></item><item><title>49.

Or are they just bold enough to do it anyway because they think that Chris won't ever sue them anyway (or they would have an easy time of getting that case dismissed)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would I play this over OpenTTD?
